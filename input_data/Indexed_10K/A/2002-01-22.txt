Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward looking statements including, without limitation, statements regarding the anticipated completion of transactions and our liquidity position and our expected overall growth that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to certain factors, including those discussed below in Factors That May Affect Future Results and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Our company, incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global diversified technology organization that provides enabling solutions to high growth markets within the communications, electronics and life sciences industries. Prior to our initial public offering of 15.9 percent of our stock in November 1999, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Hewlett Packard Company (HP). HP distributed the remaining 84.1 percent of our stock to its stockholders on June 2, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend. Basis of Presentation Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years refer to our fiscal year. The 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations, changes in cash flows, and the financial position of our businesses. We began accumulating retained earnings on November 1, 1999. The 1999 consolidated financial statements were prepared using HPs historical bases in the assets and liabilities and our historical results of operations. The 1999 consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain HP corporate expenses, including centralized research and development, legal, accounting, employee benefits, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury and other HP corporate and infrastructure costs. The expense allocations were determined on bases that HP and we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to us or the benefit received by us. Therefore, the financial information presented in this Annual Report for 1999 is not necessarily indicative of what our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate, stand alone entity in 1999. Discontinued Operations On August 1, 2001, we completed the sale of our healthcare solutions business to Koninklijke Philips Electronics, N.V. (Philips) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement for a total purchase price of $1.7 billion. Philips paid initial proceeds of $1.6 billion to us on August 1, 2001, with further payments to follow pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of November 17, 2000, as amended and supplemented by the Amendment and Supplemental Agreement, dated as of August 1, 2001. The total purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the determination of the final purchased net assets and on our performance of certain services for Philips. Since August 1, 2001 we have received approximately $80 million of the $100 million purchase price holdback in additional proceeds from Philips. We expect to receive the remaining proceeds in 2002. Our consolidated financial statements reflect our healthcare solutions business as discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions (APB 30). The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our healthcare solutions business have been classified as 28 Table of Contents discontinued, and prior periods have been restated, including the reallocation of general overhead charges to our three remaining business segments. We recorded an after tax gain of $646 million as a result of this transaction. We do not expect material adjustments to the gain when the determination of the final purchased net assets and the performance of certain services are complete. We are restricted from competing in the development, manufacturing, selling or servicing of certain medical products for five years. For incremental fees, we have provided certain support services to Philips after August 1, 2001 and we will continue to provide those services in the future. A portion of these fees offset costs that include an element of fixed costs which are recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses. Restructuring and Asset Impairment In 2001, as a result of the economic downturn that has impacted many of the markets that we serve, we have taken steps to restructure our businesses. We have announced measures to cut discretionary costs, to reduce the size of our workforce and to reduce the number of sites that we occupy. On August 20, 2001, we announced a plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 4,000, or about nine percent, by the middle of 2002. In November 2001, we announced a further reduction of 4,000 jobs, combined with other measures designed to restore profitability in the latter half of 2002. The total cost of these plans is estimated to be $350 million, of which $154 million was recognized in 2001. Of this amount, $79 million was included in cost of products and services, $17 million was included in research and development expenses and $58 million was included in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of October 31, 2001, $65 million in severance benefits had been paid and the remainder of the restructuring liability is expected to be utilized during 2002. In the second half of 2001, we reduced our workforce by approximately 3,000 employees. In June 2001 we recognized a $74 million asset impairment charge with respect to our decision to cancel the development of a software system for our customer support activities. We have entered into an agreement with HP to extend our use of their legacy customer support systems in place of the one that we were developing. The decision to continue the use of HPs systems enabled us to reduce costs at a critical time, minimize disruption to our customers and businesses and to focus on our customers needs. In 1999, we recognized an impairment loss of $51 million related to a building that was under construction to house manufacturing operations for eight inch CMOS semiconductor wafers. At the time construction was stopped, only the building shell was complete; we concluded that the highest fair value to be realized from this building was based on selling it for use as an office or general use facility. Acquisitions On January 5, 2001, we acquired Objective Systems Integrators, Inc. (OSI) for approximately $716 million. Of this total, $690 million was cash and the remainder represents the fair value of options granted. Using the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets including goodwill. The original goodwill balance of $593 million is being amortized over three years. The net book value of goodwill associated with this acquisition at October 31, 2001 was $432 million. OSI is a leading provider of next generation operations support system software for communications service providers and has become part of the test and measurement business. In July 1999, HP entered into an agreement with Yokogawa Electric Corporation (Yokogawa) to acquire Yokogawas 25 percent equity interest in Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. for approximately $521 million. In the initial step, which occurred in January 2000, we purchased approximately 10.4 percent of Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. shares from Yokogawa for approximately $206 million. In the second step, which occurred in April 2000, we purchased approximately 10.4 percent of additional Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. shares from Yokogawa for approximately $216 million. In 29 Table of Contents January 2001, we completed our acquisition of Yokogawas 25 percent equity interest in Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. by purchasing the remaining 4.2 percent interest for approximately $99 million. Of the total purchase price, $243 million was allocated to tangible assets and $278 million was attributed to goodwill which is being amortized over 10 years. The remaining net book value of goodwill associated with this acquisition was $240 million at October 31, 2001. In addition to the OSI and Yokogawa acquisitions, we acquired several other companies during 2001, 2000, and 1999 which were not significant to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method. The results of operations of the acquired companies were included prospectively from the date of acquisition and the acquisition cost was allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on fair market values at the date of acquisition. Residual amounts were recorded as goodwill. In process research and development write offs have not been significant. Goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated economic life, generally three to five years except as noted above. The net book value of goodwill and other intangible assets was $1.1 billion at October 31, 2001 and $467 million at October 31, 2000. Sale of Leasing Portfolio In the fourth quarter of 2000, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Tyco Capital Corporation (Tyco Capital) pursuant to which we have sold them substantially all of our leasing portfolio (Tyco Capital sale) over the course of the last five quarters. The impact on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations of the lease portfolio sale is shown below. Year Ended Year Ended October 31, 2001 October 31, 2000 Net proceeds from Tyco Capital sale $ 287 $ 234 Product revenue $ 254 $ 197 Cost of products $ 131 $ 83 Our service revenues and cost of services were reduced in 2001 as our portfolio of operating leases was purchased by Tyco Capital. Correspondingly, product revenue and cost of products increased as a direct result of the Tyco Capital sale. We expect future operating lease revenue to be further reduced because we also entered into a vendor financing arrangement with Tyco Capital whereby Tyco Capital will provide equipment financing and leasing services to our customers on a global basis. This agreement has been in place since the fourth quarter of 2000. As a result of this agreement and the Tyco Capital sale our lease revenue and associated costs have declined. Lease revenues as a percentage of service revenues for each of the last three fiscal years were 5.1 percent in 2001, 23.5 percent in 2000 and 22.6 percent in 1999. Property Transactions In February 2001, we sold a parcel of surplus land in San Jose, California for $287 million in cash, resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately $269 million. In August 2001, we invested in the leasehold of several municipal properties in southern California for a total value of $289 million. Cyclical Business and General Economic Conditions The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. Shifts in the semiconductor market, electronics industry, computer industry and telecommunications markets, as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions, have had and will have significant impacts on our businesses. 30 Table of Contents In 2001, an economic downturn reduced consumer and capital spending in many of the worldwide markets that we serve. It also has created an imbalance of supply and demand in the wireless and semiconductor manufacturing industries. We are uncertain as to how long and how severe the current downturn may be in these markets. In 2001, net revenue and net earnings were down 10 percent and 77 percent, respectively, compared to 2000. Substantially all of the impacts of this decline occurred in our test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses. Our earnings from continuing operations in 2000 declined 184 percent to a loss from continuing operations in 2001. Additionally, as a capital equipment provider, our revenue is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their businesses and in the economy. We expect some portions of our businesses to remain cyclical in the future. Given that a high proportion of our costs are fixed, variability in revenue as a result of these business cycles could disproportionately affect our quarterly and annual results. Our revenue and operating results for 2000 compared to 1999 improved as a result of growth in the communications and electronics markets. Impact of Foreign Currencies We sell our products in many countries and a portion of our net revenue and costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, especially in the Japanese yen and the Euro. Our foreign currency exposures are hedged as part of our global risk management program, which is designed to minimize short term exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Movements in exchange rates net of our hedging activities had no material effect on our net revenues or operating expenses in the periods presented. Adoption of New Accounting Standards Effective November 1, 2000, we adopted Statement of Financial Account Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, and requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings or stockholders equity, depending on the intended use of the instrument. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 in November 2000 resulted in a cumulative pre tax reduction in earnings of $41 million ($25 million after tax) primarily relating to the valuation of certain warrants to purchase securities and a pre tax increase in other comprehensive income of $10 million. We enter into certain foreign exchange contracts, primarily forwards and purchased options, to hedge exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101). During the fourth quarter of 2001, we adopted SAB 101 retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year. The cumulative effect of the adoption, reflecting the deferral of net revenue and cost of products from October 31, 2000, resulted in a cumulative pre tax reduction in earnings of $74 million ($47 million after tax). As a result of adopting SAB 101, delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2001, the net impact on 2001 net revenue, including amounts deferred at October 31, 2001, was an increase of $67 million of net revenue and $29 million of cost of products which were included in the cumulative effect adjustment. The results for the first three quarters of 2001 have been restated in accordance with SAB 101. Pro forma amounts for the periods beginning before November 1, 2000 have not been presented, as the effect of the change could not be reasonably determined. 31 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result of SFAS No. 141, all acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001 are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We plan to adopt SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of 2003. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001 not be amortized. Until we adopt the new standard, we will continue to amortize goodwill existing at June 30, 2001 and to test all goodwill for impairment using the current method, that uses an undiscounted cash flow test. After adoption, we will stop amortizing all goodwill and will begin to test goodwill for impairment pursuant to SFAS No. 142, that applies a fair value based test. We are assessing the further impacts of SFAS No. 142 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 144 no later than fiscal year 2003. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 144 and do not believe that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Our operating lease revenue has decreased in 2001 as a result of the Tyco Capital sale, as described more fully above. Excluding the Tyco Capital sale of $254 million in 2001 and $197 million in 2000, net revenue for 2001 decreased 11.2 percent compared to 2000 and net revenue for 2000 increased 34.2 percent compared to 1999. The decrease in net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 related primarily to a slowdown in the telecommunications, semiconductor and computer industries, which has severely impacted our customers ability to purchase our products. The increase in net revenue for 2000 compared to 1999 was spurred by continued growth in net revenue from the communications and 32 Table of Contents electronics markets. This was especially due to the robust demand for our wireless, fiber optics, networking and imaging components within our semiconductor products business and for most products throughout our test and measurement business. Increased demand in Asia also contributed to net revenue growth in 2000. The decrease in domestic net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 came primarily from our businesses which serve the communications and electronics markets. This slowdown has impacted our net revenue in the United States somewhat more severely than other parts of the world. In contrast, the increase in domestic net revenue for 2000 compared to 1999 came primarily from our businesses which serve the communications and electronics markets. The increase in international net revenue for 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily attributable to increased demand in Asia, particularly in Taiwan, Korea and Japan. There was minimal currency impact on net revenue growth in 2000. The decrease in product revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily driven by a slowdown in communications and electronics markets. The net revenue growth in 2000 was primarily due to growth in our businesses which serve the communications and electronics markets, a strengthening of the semiconductor industry and increased demand in Asia. The decline in service revenue for 2001 is primarily the result of the Tyco Capital sale and the decline in service contract renewal rates. Generally, there is a lag between service revenue trends and product revenue trends. This lag occurs because service revenue is directly related to the size of our installed base of products not covered by warranty. Costs and Expenses Years Ended October 31, 2001 over 2000 2000 over 1999 As a % of Net Revenue 2001 2000 1999 Ppts Change Ppts Change Cost of products as a percentage of product revenue 62.3 % 49.9 % 52.6 % 12.4 (2.7 ) Cost of services and other as a percentage of services and other revenue 55.1 % 55.7 % 56.6 % (0.6 ) (0.9 ) Total costs as a percentage of total net revenue 61.5 % 50.6 % 53.1 % 10.9 (2.5 ) Research and development 16.1 % 12.1 % 12.9 % 4.0 (0.8 ) Selling, general and administrative 31.7 % 27.5 % 27.8 % 4.2 (0.3 ) Excluding the Tyco Capital sale and restructuring charges of $79 million in 2001, cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue for 2001 increased 10.1 percentage points compared to 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to decreased sales volume and increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory. During 2001, cost of products as a percentage of product revenue has increased due to these same factors mentioned above and higher discounts offered to our customers. Excluding the Tyco Capital sale in 2000 and the impairment charge of $51 million in 1999, cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue in 2000 decreased 1.6 percentage points compared to 1999. The decrease in 2000 was primarily attributable to higher volumes in the test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses as well as a more profitable product mix in the semiconductor products business. Research and development expenses increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of continuing expenditures toward new product introductions. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to goodwill amortization relating to our 2001 acquisition of OSI. As a result of various cost cutting initiatives in 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses before the effect of goodwill and 33 Table of Contents other intangible amortization, restructuring and asset impairment charges declined 12 percent compared to 2000. General overhead costs of $88 million in 2001, $225 million in 2000 and $194 million in 1999 previously allocated to our healthcare solutions segment have been reallocated to each of the three remaining segments. (Loss) Earnings from Operations Years Ended October 31, 2001 over 2000 2000 over 1999 2001 2000 1999 Change Change (In millions) (Loss) earnings from operations $ (778 ) $ 924 $ 422 (184.2)% 119.0% Operating (deficit) margin (9.3 )% 9.9 % 6.2 % (19.2 points) 3.7 points Excluding the Tyco Capital sale, we had a loss from operations of $901 million in 2001 compared to earnings from operations of $810 million in 2000 and $422 million in 1999. Excluding the restructuring charges and Tyco Capital sale, we had a loss from operations of $447 million in 2001 compared to earnings from operations of $925 million in 2000 and $463 million in 1999. The decrease in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the fact that net revenue declined much more rapidly than costs and expenses in the test and measurement and semiconductor businesses. Increased goodwill amortization related to recent acquisitions also contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by the performance of our chemical analysis business. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to strong results in the test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses. These improved results were partially offset by flat performance from our chemical analysis business and additional on going costs associated with operating on our own as an independent company. Other Income (Expense), Net Years Ended October 31, 2001 over 2000 2000 over 1999 2001 2000 1999 % Change % Change (In millions) Other income (expense), net $ 301 $ 94 $ 41 220.2% 129.3% Other income (expense), net increased $207 million to $301 million in 2001 from $94 million in 2000. The increase was primarily due to the sale of land in San Jose, California which resulted in a pre tax gain of $269 million. The increase in other income (expense), net for 2001 compared to 2000 was partially offset by higher interest expense due to a higher average debt balance. Other income (expense), net increased $53 million to $94 million in 2000 from $41 million in 1999. The increase was primarily due to a pre tax gain of $29 million related to the sale of equity investments that no longer supported our business strategies and interest income earned on the initial cash funding received from HP in 1999. We sold assets related to portions of our businesses to third parties during 2001, 2000 and 1999. Gross proceeds from these dispositions were $13 million in 2001, immaterial in 2000 and $71 million in 1999. Gains from the dispositions, included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of earnings, were $9 million in 2001, immaterial in 2000 and $50 million in 1999. (Benefit) Provision for Taxes The effective tax rate for continuing operations in 2001 was 19 percent. For 2000 and 1999, the effective rate was 34 percent. In 2001, the change in the tax rate for continuing operations is due to the tax benefits arising from the losses caused by the recent global economic downturn. This is offset by the impact of non deductible goodwill from the acquisition of OSI. Taxes on the sale of our healthcare solutions 34 Table of Contents business are reflected in the gain from sale of discontinued operations. Our future effective tax rate will continue to be calculated using an estimate of our pre tax income and will be subject to the impact of future profitability, the effects of business acquisitions and dispositions, as well as changes in the mix of our pre tax earnings among jurisdictions with varying statutory rates. Segment Results In 2001, our management changed its measure of the profitability of each of the business segments to exclude goodwill and other intangible amortization and non recurring items such as restructuring charges. These items have been excluded for all periods presented. Test and Measurement Our test and measurement business provides test instruments, standard and customized test, measurement and monitoring instruments and systems for the design, manufacture and support of electronics and communications devices and software for the design of high frequency electronic and communications devices and networks. Years Ended October 31, 2001 over 2000 2000 over 1999 2001 2000 1999 Change Change (In millions) Net revenue from products $ 4,763 $ 5,298 $ 3,400 (10.1)% 55.8% Net revenue from services and other 669 810 682 (17.4)% 18.8% Total net revenue $ 5,432 $ 6,108 $ 4,082 (11.1)% 49.6% (Loss) earnings from operations (141 ) 706 250 (120.0)% 182.4% Operating margin (deficit) (2.6 )% 11.6 % 6.1 % (14.2) points 5.5 points Net Revenue Net revenue for 2001 decreased 11.1 percent compared to 2000. Excluding the Tyco Capital sale, total net revenue for 2001 declined 12.4 percent compared to 2000. The slowdown in the telecommunications and semiconductor industries was the main factor that caused the decline in net revenue for 2001. The slowdown was particularly sharp in the second half of 2001 as we became increasingly dependent on incoming orders which declined in virtually all of the product lines of our test and measurement businesses. Net revenue for 2000 increased 49.6 percent compared to 1999. The increase in 2000 was attributable to strong growth in the sales of our products to the optical, wireless and networking markets. In addition, third party manufacturing contractors added capacity to meet demand and increased their purchases of our test and measurement products. Excluding the Tyco Capital sale, net revenue from products for 2001 decreased 11.6 percent compared to 2000. The decrease in net revenue from products was primarily due to a slowdown in telecommunications and semiconductor industries. Net revenue from services and other for 2001 decreased 17.4 percent compared to 2000 primarily due to the Tyco Capital sale. In addition, certain customers have chosen not to renew their service contracts. Excluding the Tyco Capital sale, net revenue from products for 2000 increased 50.1 percent compared to 1999. The increase was primarily due to the growing communications market and the increased demand in Asia. Net revenue from services and other for 2000 increased 18.8 percent compared to 1999. 35 Table of Contents Costs and Expenses The following table shows the percentage point increase or decrease in our test and measurement business costs and expenses as a percentage of net revenue for 2001, 2000 and 1999. 2001 over 2000 2000 over 1999 Increase/(decrease) as a % of Net Revenue Ppts Change Ppts Change Cost of products and services 11.2 (0.9 ) Research and development 3.7 (2.2 ) Selling, general and administrative (0.7 ) (2.3 ) Cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory. Excluding the impacts of these charges, cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased 5.4 percentage points in 2001 from 2000. Due to the fixed nature of our manufacturing costs, lower than anticipated manufacturing volumes contributed to the increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to our continuing expenditures toward new product introductions. (Loss) Earnings from Operations Loss from operations in 2001 was a result of reduced demand, which led to fewer sales and increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory. Excluding the Tyco Capital sale, loss from operations was $263 million compared to earnings from operations of $594 million in 2000 and $250 million in 1999. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 resulted primarily from higher net revenue. Semiconductor Products Our semiconductor products business provides fiber optic communications devices and assemblies, components and integrated circuits for wireless, networking, computing and printing applications, image sensors and general purpose opto electronic components. Years Ended October 31, 2001 over 2000 2000 over 1999 2001 2000 1999 Change Change (In millions) Net revenue $ 1,850 $ 2,213 $ 1,722 (16.4)% 28.5% (Loss) earnings from operations (183 ) 248 155 (173.8)% 60.0% Operating (deficit) margin (9.9 )% 11.2 % 9.0 % (21.1 points) 2.2 points Net Revenue The decrease in net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to a sharp decline in demand for our semiconductor products. The global economic slowdown led to lower volumes in virtually all product lines of our semiconductor products business. Total net revenue for 2001 included $35 million of non recurring royalty revenue relating to changes in our agreement with Adaptec Inc. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was the result of strong growth in all semiconductor products including wireless, networking and imaging components. Networking component growth was the result of growth in the sales of fiber optic transceivers and high speed networking products tailored for Metro Area Network (MAN), as well as storage area networking products and Gigabit Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN) applications. Imaging products for digital cameras and optical mice also achieved particularly strong growth in 2000. As a percentage of net revenue for the semiconductor products business, revenue from sales to HP, consisting primarily of 36 Table of Contents application specific integrated circuits and motion control products, was 30.7 percent for 2001, 30.3 percent for 2000 and 37.0 percent for 1999. In 2000, we expanded our existing joint venture relationship with Philips to develop our manufacturing of light emitting diodes (LED) and transferred a portion of our LED business into the joint venture. LEDs are used for various lighting and display purposes. Since we do not have a majority ownership interest in the joint venture, the revenue, costs and expenses of the LED business transferred to the joint venture are no longer consolidated in our results. Instead, we record our portion of the joint ventures net earnings or loss in other income (expense), net, which in 2000, was minimal. Adjusting the 1999 base for revenues relating to the LED business and our exit from the microprocessor business, net revenue growth for 2000 would have been 40.3 percent. Costs and Expenses The following table shows the percentage point increase or decrease in our semiconductor products businesss costs and expenses as a percentage of its net revenue for 2001, 2000 and 1999. 2001 over 2000 2000 over 1999 Increase/(decrease) as a % of Net Revenue Ppts Change Ppts Change Cost of products 12.0 (3.2 ) Research and development 6.7 0.5 Selling, general and administrative 2.4 0.5 The increase in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to increased inventory charges for excess and obsolete inventory as a result of reduced demand for our semiconductor products. In addition, due to the fixed nature of our manufacturing costs, lower than anticipated manufacturing volumes contributed to the increase in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue. Unfavorable mix and large shipments to single customers carrying deep discounts impacted cost of products as a percentage of net revenue unfavorably. Excluding the impacts of increased inventory charges, cost of products as a percentage of net revenue for 2001 increased 7.7 percentage points compared to 2000. Cost of products as a percentage of net revenue for 2000 decreased 3.2 percentage points compared to 1999. The decrease related primarily to increased volumes and a more favorable product mix. The increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 was driven by a continued commitment to develop new products in the fiber optics, high speed networking, and image position sensor businesses. (Loss) Earnings from Operations The loss from operations in 2001 compared to earnings from operations in 2000 resulted primarily from lower net revenue and higher cost of products and expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 resulted from higher net revenue and lower cost of products as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. 37 Table of Contents Chemical Analysis Our chemical analysis business provides analytical instruments, systems and services for chromatography, spectroscopy, bio instrumentation and consumables to the chemical and life science markets. Years Ended October 31, 2001 over 2000 2000 over 1999 2001 2000 1999 Change Change (In millions) Net revenue from products $ 872 $ 788 $ 773 10.7% 1.9% Net revenue from services and other 242 252 253 (4.0)% (0.4)% Total net revenue $ 1,114 $ 1,040 $ 1,026 7.1% 1.4% Earnings from operations 118 41 91 187.8% (54.9)% Operating margin 10.6 % 3.9 % 8.9 % 6.7 points (5.0 points) Net Revenue The increase in net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 was the result of increased sales of our products in the life sciences market moderated by decreased sales of our products in our traditional chemical and petrochemical markets. Net revenue from products including liquid chromatography equipment, bioanalyzers and microarrays grew more than 19.6 percent in 2001 compared to 2000. Net revenue growth in 2000 as compared to 1999, was essentially flat as our products sold to the pharmaceutical and life sciences markets was partially offset by weakness in our traditional chemical and environmental markets. New product releases contributed to increased sales of our liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry products. Services and other revenue decreased slightly in 2001 compared to 2000 while it was flat in 2000 compared to 1999. Costs and Expenses The following table shows the percentage point increase and decrease in our chemical analysis business costs and expenses as a percentage of its net revenue for 2001, 2000 and 1999. 2001 over 2000 2000 over 1999 Increase/(decrease) as a % of Net Revenue Ppts Change Ppts Change Cost of products and services (0.5) 0.9 Research and development (1.0) 2.4 Selling, general and administrative (5.1) 1.6 Cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was relatively flat in 2001 compared to 2000. Additional depreciation expense related to increased spending in manufacturing capacity for microarrays was offset by cost controls and improved operational efficiencies. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to start up costs for life sciences products. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 reflected our efforts to reduce cost structures and discretionary expenses. In 2000, the increase resulted primarily from increased life sciences research and development activities, higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses relating to operating on our own. Earnings from Operations The increase in earnings from operations in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to higher net revenue and reduced spending resulting from our cost reduction measures. In addition, operational efficiencies arising out of manufacturing centralization efforts begun in fiscal 2000 and increased volumes contributed to the increase. The decrease in earnings from operations in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to 38 Table of Contents the costs of operating on our own as well as planned research and development in life sciences to launch new products. Healthcare Solutions Discontinued Operations Our healthcare solutions business has been classified as a discontinued operation. The table below shows the results of our healthcare solutions business before general overhead allocations and net of the costs of divestiture. Results for the year ended October 31, 2001 include operations from November 1, 2000 to May 31, 2001, the measurement date in accordance with APB 30. The net loss from discontinued operations of $58 million for the two month period following our May 31, 2001 measurement date has been included in the gain from sale of discontinued operations. The after tax gain resulting from the sale of our healthcare solutions business including this loss was $646 million. The following table shows the detailed results of operations of our discontinued healthcare solutions business for 2001, 2000 and 1999. These results are also included in our condensed consolidated statement of earnings as net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999. Years Ended October 31, 2001(a) 2000 1999 (In millions) Net revenue $ 765 $ 1,412 $ 1,501 Costs and expenses 747 1,283 1,182 Earnings from discontinued operations 18 129 319 Other income (expense), net 3 17 5 Earnings from discontinued operations before taxes 21 146 324 Provision for taxes 15 61 118 Net earnings from discontinued operations $ 6 $ 85 $ 206 (a) Includes operations from November 1, 2000 to May 31, 2001, the measurement date. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial position remained strong at October 31, 2001, with cash and cash equivalents of $1,170 million. Cash usage from our continuing operations was $114 million in 2001. We generated cash from continuing operations of $536 million in 2000 compared to $341 million in 1999. In 2001, accounts payable used cash of $480 million and income tax payable used cash of $472 million offset by a decrease in outstanding accounts receivable totaling $933 million. In 2000 and 1999, cash from continuing operations was primarily a result of net earnings. In addition, lower cash from continuing operations in 1999 resulted from a significant increase in accounts receivable due to particularly strong shipments in October 1999. Net cash utilized for investing activities was $1,365 million for 2001 compared to $1,062 million for 2000 and $336 million for 1999. In all periods, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and business acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from divestitures and the disposal of excess, unused or retired assets constituted substantially all of our cash used in investing activities. We used $904 million for acquiring several businesses and $881 million for investments in property, plant and equipment in 2001. We used $634 million in 2000 to pay for the first and second installments of the purchase of Yokagawas minority interest in Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. along with investments in several other companies. We purchased the remaining 4.2 percent of Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd.s shares owned by Yokogawa in January 2001. HP provided the 39 Table of Contents funding for the entire Yokogawa transaction in November 1999. In 2001, we sold the remaining portion of our portfolio of lease assets to Tyco Capital. Net proceeds from these sales transactions were $287 million. We have two revolving credit facilities with no outstanding balances at the end of 2001. Those facilities are a $250 million facility that terminates on November 5, 2005 and a 364 day $250 million facility that terminated on November 2, 2001. In November 2001, we extended the latter facility to November 1, 2002. As of November 19, 2001, the revolving credit facilities were amended to reflect new debt covenants. In addition to these committed facilities, we have access to uncommitted credit lines through our banking partners. On January 5, 2001, we acquired Objective Systems Integrators, Inc. for a total purchase price of $716 million. Of this total, $690 million was cash and the remainder represents the fair value of options granted. In February 2001, we sold surplus land in San Jose, California for $287 million, net of transaction costs. In August 2001, we invested in the leasehold of several municipal properties in southern California for a total value of $289 million. On August 1, 2001 we completed the sale of our healthcare solutions business to Philips and received approximately $1.6 billion in cash at that time. We have subsequently received approximately $80 million in proceeds relating to the sale. Cash flows from discontinued operations include the proceeds from the sale and cash used in the operations of the healthcare solutions business during the year up until the date of sale. On November 27, 2001, we announced the closing of a private offering of $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 3 percent senior convertible debentures due 2021. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, and to fund potential acquisitions and restructuring costs. The debentures are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of $32.22 per share. The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in December 2004, and holders of the debentures have the ability to require us to repurchase the debentures, in whole or in part, on specified dates in 2006, 2011 and 2016. Prior to November 1, 1999, cash receipts associated with our businesses were transferred to HP on a daily basis and HP provided funds to cover our disbursements. Accordingly, we reported no cash or cash equivalents at October 31, 1999 and 1998. In accordance with our separation agreement with HP, as of November 1, 1999, HP retained some of our assets and liabilities and transferred to us some of the assets and liabilities related to its business. In November and December 1999, HP made cash payments to us totaling $1.3 billion to fund our working capital and other needs of our operations as a separate, stand alone entity. In addition, HP transferred approximately $0.5 billion to fund our acquisition of Yokogawas 25 percent minority interest in Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. The net proceeds of our initial public offering of $2.1 billion were received in November 1999 and immediately distributed to HP as a dividend. Of the total $1.8 billion received from HP, $1.1 billion was classified as net cash provided by financing activities and $0.7 billion was classified among several categories as net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended October 31, 2000. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our businesses and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economies and markets. We believe that cash on hand plus the proceeds from our bond offering will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure, research and development and restructuring requirements for the foreseeable future. However, we may require or choose to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future. We cannot assure that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms. 40 Table of Contents Factors That May Affect Future Results Our operating results and financial condition could continue to be harmed if the industries into which we sell our products, such as the communications, electronics and semiconductor industries, remain depressed. The current economic downturn has resulted in reduced purchasing and capital spending in many of the markets that we serve worldwide. In particular, the communications, semiconductor and electronics industries are currently in a downward cycle characterized by diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and the erosion of average selling prices. We are uncertain how long the current downturn will last. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 may exacerbate this downturn or cause it to linger. Any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price. In addition, we may be required to secure additional debt or equity financing, and we cannot assure you that such financing will be available when required on acceptable terms. The actions we have taken in response to the recent slowdown in demand for our products and services could have long term adverse effects on our business. Our semiconductor and test and measurement businesses have been experiencing lower revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders. Orders for our products and services have decreased in five of the past six quarters. To scale back our operations and decrease our expenses in response to this decrease in demand for our products and services and decrease in our revenue, we have reduced our workforce, frozen hiring, cut back significantly on our use of temporary workers and reduced discretionary spending. We also have initiated short term facility closures to reduce production levels. Earlier this year we announced our plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 4,000 people, or about 9 percent, by the middle of 2002. In addition, from May 1 to October 31 of this year, we instituted a 10 percent reduction in pay applicable to all employees globally, wherever legally permissible. The reduction in pay took effect via a 10 percent reduction in hours for certain employees, in accordance with local law. On November 15, 2001, we announced that we intend to further reduce our workforce by approximately 4,000 people. We also announced that we would reinstate the 10 percent pay reduction for approximately 2,000 of our senior managers starting from the first quarter fiscal 2002 and that we would effectively reduce the salaries of our other employees by 5 percent, wherever legally permissible, effective February 2002. In addition to these measures, we are continuing our initiatives to streamline our operations. There are several risks inherent in our efforts to transition to a new cost structure. These include the risk that we will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough to restore profitability and may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges. In addition, there is the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products and remain competitive in the industries in which we compete. Each of the above measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, making it more difficult for us to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be. 41 Table of Contents As demand for our products does not match our manufacturing capacity, our earnings may continue to suffer. Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. Currently, we have excess manufacturing capacity as a result of the recent decrease in purchasing and capital spending in the communications, electronics and semiconductor industries. The fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our earnings. Conversely, if during a market upturn, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner, which in turn may have a negative effect on our earnings and overall business. Failure to adjust our orders for parts due to changing market conditions could adversely affect our earnings. Our earnings could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our orders for parts to market fluctuations. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may enter into non cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts as demand for our communications, semiconductor and electronics products has decreased. For example, in the year ended October 31, 2001 we incurred a charge of approximately $459 million for inventory related charges. If the demand for our products continues to decrease, we may experience an excess of parts again and be forced to incur additional charges. By contrast, during a market upturn, our results could be materially and adversely impacted if we cannot increase our parts supply quickly enough to meet increasing demand for our products. Certain parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to substitute without significant reengineering of our products. Suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the debentures. Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. As demand for our products has decreased in recent periods, our quarterly sales and operating results have become highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast. The reduction in the backlog of our orders also has significantly affected our ability to efficiently plan production and inventory levels, which has led to fluctuations in operating results. In addition, a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. If we cannot adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall, this may magnify the adverse impact of a revenue shortfall on our results of operations. Fluctuations in our operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the debentures. We are in the process of implementing new information systems, and problems with the redesign and implementation of these new systems could interfere with our operations. We are in the process of implementing new information systems to eventually replace our current systems, which are largely based on legacy systems that we created when we were a part of Hewlett Packard. We may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data. As a part of this effort, we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software applications to manage our business operations. Failure to smoothly and successfully implement this and other systems could temporarily interrupt our operations and adversely impact our ability to run 42 Table of Contents our business. In addition, any failure or significant downtime in our legacy or new information systems could prevent us from taking customer orders, shipping products or billing customers and could harm our business. If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer. We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to: properly identify customer needs; innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications; successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time; differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings; price our products competitively; and anticipate our competitors announcements of new products, services or technological innovations. Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. Since we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and the U.S. and international response could exacerbate these risks. For example, there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions such as Southeast Asia, where we have significant manufacturing operations. This could disrupt our ability to manufacture products or important parts as well as cause interruptions and or delays in our ability to transport products to our customers or parts to other locations for continued 43 Table of Contents manufacture and assembly. Any such delay or interruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel. Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. Although the labor market has changed dramatically within the past year, and our attrition rate has dropped, there is still intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit. Our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected. In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from the investment communitys expectations in a given quarter. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including: the retention of key employees; the management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas; the retention of key customers; and the integration or coordination of different research and development, product manufacturing and sales programs and facilities. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to: effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser; identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and stock price could be negatively impacted. If sales of custom integrated circuits to Hewlett Packard decline, our semiconductor products revenue will suffer, and we are limited in our ability to sell these integrated circuits to other companies. Historically, our semiconductor products business has sold custom products to Hewlett Packard and has engaged in product development efforts with divisions of Hewlett Packard. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2001, Hewlett Packard accounted for approximately 6.8 percent of our total net revenue and approximately 30.7 percent of our semiconductor products business net revenue. 44 Table of Contents We have a license agreement with Hewlett Packard that covers integrated circuit technology used in custom integrated circuits for Hewlett Packards printers, scanners and computers. The license agreement provides that, until November 2002 in some cases and until November 2009 in other cases, we are prohibited, with some exceptions, from using this integrated circuit technology for the development and sale of integrated circuits for use in inkjet products, printer products (including printer supplies, accessories and components), document scanners and computing products to third parties other than Hewlett Packard. Although we have entered into a supply agreement for the sale to Hewlett Packard of custom integrated circuits used in printers, scanners and computers, the agreement does not require Hewlett Packard to purchase a minimum amount of product from us. In the event that Hewlett Packard reduces its purchases of our custom integrated circuits, we would be unable to address this reduction through sales of these kinds of integrated circuits for these types of products to other customers. We may face significant costs in order to comply with laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, processing, and distribution of chemicals, or regarding notification about chemicals, and if we fail to comply, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or be prohibited from distributing our products. Some of our chemical analysis business products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the Toxic Substances Control Act. We must conform the manufacture, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance. Environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved. Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by Hewlett Packard for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from Hewlett Packard. Hewlett Packard has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time consuming negotiations and litigation. In addition, Hewlett Packard will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While Hewlett Packard has agreed to minimize interference with on site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that Hewlett Packard will fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations. We have agreed to indemnify Hewlett Packard for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from Hewlett Packard to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by Hewlett Packard. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with existing subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination. 45 Table of Contents Environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future. Our semiconductor and other manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. We may be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability. We and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Our businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local, health and safety, packaging, product content and labor regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation of other agencies such as the United States Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses will be harmed. Our chemical analysis products are used in the drug design and production processes to test compliance with the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and similar regulations. Therefore, we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and our failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products. Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to infringe those intellectual property rights. While we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, products and services. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. 46 Table of Contents The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. However, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products. We often rely on licenses of intellectual property useful for our businesses. We cannot assure you that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. In addition, our position with respect to the negotiation of licenses has changed as a result of our separation from Hewlett Packard. In the past, as a part of Hewlett Packard, we benefited from our access to Hewlett Packards entire intellectual property portfolio when asserting counterclaims and negotiating cross licenses with third parties. Our current patent cross license agreement with Hewlett Packard gives us only a limited right to sublicense a portion of Hewlett Packards intellectual property portfolio. Accordingly, we may be unable to obtain agreements on terms as favorable as we may have been able to obtain if we could have sublicensed Hewlett Packards entire intellectual property portfolio. Nothing restricts Hewlett Packard from competing with us other than some restrictions on the use of patents licensed to Hewlett Packard by us. Third parties may infringe our intellectual property, and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury. Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. Our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of these patents or trademark registrations. In addition, our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share. If we suffer loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their location. We have significant facilities in areas with above average seismic activity, such as our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Laboratories in California and our production facilities in Washington and Japan. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. We self insure against such losses and do not carry catastrophic insurance policies to cover potential losses resulting from earthquakes.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar. Our exposure to exchange rate risks has been managed on an enterprise wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and loses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2001 and 2000, the analysis indicated that theses hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
