Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements including, without limitation, statements regarding our liquidity position and our expected overall growth, the material impact from the adoption of new accounting pronouncements, our financial results, the impact of the enterprise resource planning implementation, savings from restructuring programs, the length of the economic downturn, trends and growth in the markets we sell into, the anticipated completion of transactions and contracts, new product introductions and changes to our manufacturing process that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to certain factors, including those discussed below in Factors That May Affect Future Results and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Agilent Technologies, Inc. (we, Agilent or the Company), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global diversified technology organization that provides enabling solutions to technology markets within the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Prior to our initial public offering of 16 percent of our stock in November 1999, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Hewlett Packard Company (Hewlett Packard). Hewlett Packard distributed the remaining 84 percent of our stock to its stockholders on June 2, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend. Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year. Reclassifications Amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended October 31, 2001 and October 31, 2000 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in 2002. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the Company in the future, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, restructuring and impairment charges, inventory valuation, retirement and post retirement plan assumptions, valuation of long lived assets and accounting for income taxes. Revenue is recognized on a sale to a customer only after the product or service has been delivered or installed and accepted by the customer. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and distributor price protection, when appropriate. We monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and do not record revenue on sales if collection is not reasonably assured. Most of these conditions are subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome, requiring future adjustments to revenue. We accrue for restructuring costs when management approves and commits to a firm plan. The three main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions, the consolidation of excess facilities and asset impairments, primarily property, plant and equipment. Workforce 31 Table of Contents related charges are accrued based on an estimate of expected benefits that will be paid out to the employees. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and losses anticipated from sub lease agreements, net of estimated future sublease income. Asset impairment charges are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected sales or disposals of buildings and equipment that we currently use in manufacturing, research and development and support. These estimates were derived using the guidance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of (SFAS No. 121), Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, Restructuring and Impairment Charges (SAB 100), and Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) (EITF No. 94 3). If the amounts and timing are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount could be materially different, either higher or lower, than what we have recorded. However, as of October 31, 2002 and the date of this filing, we believe our estimates remain materially correct. Beginning January 1, 2003, we will follow new guidance provided in SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS No. 146). See New Accounting Pronouncements below. We continually assess the valuation of our inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Such estimates are difficult to make under current volatile economic conditions. Reviews for excess inventory are done on a quarterly basis and required reserve levels are calculated with reference to our projected ultimate usage of that inventory. In order to determine the ultimate usage, we take into account recent sales forecasts, projected obsolescence and our current inventory levels. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our marketing department plays a key role in our excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher earnings from operations than expected in that period. Retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimates. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year. As of October 31, 2002, the expected long term rate of return in the U.S. was 8.75 percent, and ranged from 5.5 to 7.75 percent for our plans outside the U.S. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the plans are effective. Management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for each plan based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would result in increased pension expense of $10 million for 2003 in the U.S. and $7 million for 2003 for all plans outside the U.S. Pension expense is allocated to cost of sales, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 15, Retirement Plans and Post Retirement Benefits in Item 15 of this report for the full list of assumptions. We have assessed the recoverability of long lived assets, including intangible assets, by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash 32 Table of Contents flows according to the guidance of SFAS No. 121. If the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments. Changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions could result in material impairment charges in future periods. Beginning November 1, 2002, we will use the new guidance provided in SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142) and SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144). See New Accounting Pronouncements below. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable. As of October 31, 2002, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was not deemed necessary. Accordingly, if the facts or financial results were to change, thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets, judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period. We continually evaluate strategies that would allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets and currently believe we have the ability to enact strategies to fully realize our deferred tax assets should our earnings in future periods not support the full realization of the deferred tax assets. We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding tax on a portion of our non U.S. subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of October 31, 2002 because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. If management decides to remit these earnings to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for taxes may increase materially in that period. Cyclical Business and General Economic Conditions The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. Shifts in the semiconductor market, electronics industry, computer industry and telecommunications markets, as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions, have had and will have significant impacts on our businesses. In 2001, an economic downturn reduced consumer and capital spending in many of the worldwide markets that we serve. This economic downturn has continued in 2002. It also has created an imbalance of supply and demand in the wireless and semiconductor manufacturing industries. In 2002, net revenue was down 28 percent compared to 2001, and we incurred a net loss of $1,032 million compared to net earnings of $174 million in 2001. In 2002, loss from continuing operations increased 152 percent compared to 2001. In 2001, net revenue and net earnings were down 10 percent and 77 percent, respectively, compared to 2000. Our earnings from continuing operations in 2000 declined 160 percent to a loss from continuing operations in 2001. Substantially all of the impacts of this decline occurred in our test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses. Wireline telecommunication markets within our test and measurement group continue to decline and a recovery in these markets is not expected for some time. Additionally, as a capital equipment provider, our revenue is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. We expect some portions of our businesses to remain cyclical in the future. Given that a high proportion of our costs are fixed, variability in revenue as a result of these business cycles could disproportionately affect our quarterly and annual results. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Summary We currently have two active restructuring plans one initiated in the fourth quarter of 2001 (the 2001 Plan) and the other initiated in the fourth quarter of 2002 (the 2002 Plan) after it 33 Table of Contents became clear that the actions taken in the previous year would not be sufficient to return the company to profitability. Both plans were designed to reduce costs and expenses in order to return the company to profitability without relying on an improvement in economic conditions. To date we have achieved savings of approximately $300 million per quarter, principally through reducing our workforce by 8,000 people. Actions have been focused on segments that were impacted most severely by the changing environment our test and measurement and semiconductor products groups but actions were also taken to reduce the costs associated with support services such as finance and administration. Cost reductions were initiated by reducing the number of properties, particularly sales and administrative sites, and by reducing our workforce within the impacted segments. Our 2001 Plan was substantially complete as of October 31, 2002. The 2002 Plan is still being implemented we expect to complete it no later than the first quarter of 2004. We anticipate that we will save an additional $50 million per quarter by mid 2003 as a result of the 2002 Plan. The 2001 Plan In 2001, as a result of the economic downturn that impacted many of the markets that we serve, we took steps to restructure our businesses. On August 20, 2001, we announced a plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 4,000, or about nine percent, by the middle of 2002. On November 15, 2001, we enhanced and supplemented our plan by announcing a further reduction of 4,000 jobs once we had determined that the actions contemplated in August would not be sufficient to return us to profitability. Together these actions form the 2001 Plan, which was designed to reduce costs across almost all of our administrative and support services, including sales and marketing, and to focus our production activities on those products that we believed would return us to profitability, such as those in life sciences, semiconductor test and wireless telecommunications. Our plan impacted the test and measurement group and the semiconductor products group and had little direct impact on the life sciences and chemical analysis group except as the plan related to support services reductions across all of our businesses. Within the test and measurement segment, we reduced production capacity dramatically for communications test product lines and reduced production to some degree in general purpose and semiconductor test product lines. Within the semiconductor products segment we reduced production capacity significantly for product lines in networking, especially long haul networks, and reduced production capacity for some personal systems products. The 2001 Plan was substantially complete as of October 31, 2002, although we will continue to make lease payments on a number of properties vacated as a result of this plan through at least the next 5 years. A summary of restructuring activity for the 2001 Plan through October 31, 2002 is shown in the table below: Impairment of Consolidation Assets, Workforce of Excess Property, Plant Reduction Facilities and Equipment Total (in millions) Beginning balance at July 31, 2001 $ $ $ $ Total charge 117 20 17 154 Cash payments (65 ) (65 ) Ending balance at October 31, 2001 52 20 17 89 Total charge 175 53 129 357 Asset impairment (146 ) (146 ) Cash payments (210 ) (10 ) (220 ) Ending balance at October 31, 2002 $ 17 $ 63 $ $ 80 34 Table of Contents The three main components of the 2001 Plan relate to workforce reductions, consolidation of excess facilities and impairment of property, plant and equipment. Workforce related charges were incurred as a result of the 8,000 person workforce reduction; the cuts impacted all regions, all expense categories and most of our segments. Research and development activities were terminated on some product development initiatives, none of which were individually or in total significant to our future revenues or profitability. We also took action to reduce the number of employees at production facilities that had experienced declining demand, such as those making equipment for the long haul wireline business. Our plan to consolidate excess facilities resulted in charges for lease termination fees and losses anticipated from sub lease agreements. We have exited, or plan to exit in the near future, more than 100 production, support and sales facilities, or parts of facilities, across all regions, particularly in the U.S. and Japan, representing more than 3.6 million square feet, or about 19 percent, of our worldwide property. As of October 31, 2002, we have vacated approximately 40 percent of these facilities. The decision to exit individual facilities was made as a result of specific economic conditions in certain countries and as part of our strategy to centralize support services and to consolidate facilities. We lease most of these buildings from third parties, and the closures impacted all three of our segments. In most cases, we are exiting office space housing sales and administrative employees. However, a small number of production facilities were closed as a result of our plans to consolidate manufacturing into fewer sites. Asset impairment charges relate to fixed assets and were determined using estimates of the expected future cash flows generated from those assets. Impairments were recorded for machinery and equipment in production facilities that we were closing or scaling back, such as for the long haul wireline business and for leasehold improvements in leased facilities that we planned to exit. One production facility in Kobe, Japan accounted for approximately $60 million of the $129 million of asset impairment charges in 2002. In order to determine the amount of the impairment, under the held for use model in accordance with SFAS No. 121, we estimated the cash flows that would result from our continued use of the building until we expect to vacate it and also estimated the sales proceeds that we expected to be able to realize. The resulting impairment was approximately 80 percent of the net book value of the facility, primarily due to the decline in the local property market. We have incurred $511 million of expenses for the 2001 Plan through October 31, 2002: $154 million in 2001 and $357 million in 2002. The most significant revision to the plan was made in the fourth quarter of 2002, after updating our lease termination costs and sub lease income assumptions as the real estate leasing market continued to decline, adding a number of leased sales offices and two owned production facilities to the list that we were planning to exit, including the facility in Kobe, Japan, described above; we incurred incremental asset impairment costs of $94 million and lease facility costs of $36 million in relation to these changes. We have reduced our workforce by approximately 7,700 (approximately 6,400 from involuntary terminations and approximately 1,300 from net attrition) as of October 31, 2002 and believe we have achieved collective savings of approximately $880 million in 2002 from the restructuring efforts. Restructuring savings were $325 million in cost of sales, $160 million in research and development and $395 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. We paid approximately $210 million in cash for severance payments in 2002. The cash payments were funded using cash generated from operations, existing working capital and credit facilities, where necessary. We expect that future savings of approximately $1.2 billion per annum will be achieved in total among all types of expenses cost of products and services, research and development and selling, general and administrative. Savings are expected to be realized from the reductions in salary and benefit expenses, reduction in rent and other facilities costs and from savings associated with materials and supplies. We expect the restructuring plan to have a positive impact on our liquidity in 2003, as the savings generated are predominantly cash. 35 Table of Contents The 2002 Plan On August 19, 2002, we announced our intention to further reduce our operational costs by $50 million per quarter so that we might reach profitability at target revenue levels of $1.6 billion per quarter. We concluded that we must further reduce our breakeven point given our current level of revenues because the wireline and communications markets are recovering more slowly than we anticipated. This plan primarily affects the manufacturing and field operations serving the wireline markets that are components of our test and measurement group. A summary of restructuring activity for the 2002 Plan through October 31, 2002 is shown in the table below: Impairment of Assets, Workforce Property, Plant Reduction and Equipment Total (in millions) Beginning balance at July 31, 2002 $ $ $ Total charge 83 34 117 Asset impairment (34 ) (34 ) Cash payments (15 ) (15 ) Ending balance at October 31, 2002 $ 68 $ $ 68 As part of the 2002 Plan we have reduced our workforce by approximately 300 as of October 31, 2002, but collective savings were insignificant in 2002 because the plan implementation began late in the fourth quarter of 2002. We expect to reduce our workforce by 2,500 in total by the time the plan is completed. We expect to achieve the majority of the $50 million reduction in quarterly operational costs by mid 2003. Asset impairment charges of $34 million relate to machinery and equipment, primarily owned by the semiconductor products group in Singapore. The equipment had been purchased in support of communications research but as a result of our restructuring plans we have decided to sell the equipment and conduct the research using existing equipment in the U.S. A summary of the income statement impact of the combined plans in 2002 and 2001 is shown below. There were no significant restructuring activities in 2000. Years ended October 31, 2002 2001 (in millions) Cost of products and services $ 210 $ 79 Research and development 56 17 Selling, general and administrative 208 58 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 474 $ 154 Other asset impairment charges In June 2001, we recognized a $74 million asset impairment charge with respect to our decision to cancel the development of a software system for our customer support activities. We entered into an agreement with Hewlett Packard to extend our use of their legacy customer support systems in place of the one that we were developing. In 2002, we began to develop a new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system independent from Hewlett Packard. We expect the CRM to be initially implemented in the first quarter of 2003. 36 Table of Contents Adoption of New Accounting Standards In July 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141), which requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and changes the criteria for recognition of intangible assets acquired in a business combination. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 141 was not material to the consolidated financial statements. Effective November 1, 2000, we adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133), as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, and requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings or stockholders equity, depending on the intended use of the instrument. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 in November 2000 resulted in a cumulative pre tax reduction in earnings of $41 million ($25 million after tax) primarily relating to the valuation of warrants to purchase securities and a pre tax increase in other comprehensive income of $10 million. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101). During the fourth quarter of 2001, we adopted SAB 101 retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year. The cumulative effect of the adoption, reflecting the deferral of net revenue and cost of products from October 31, 2000, resulted in a cumulative pre tax reduction in earnings of $74 million ($47 million after tax). As a result of adopting SAB 101, delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2001, the net impact on 2001 net revenue, including amounts deferred at October 31, 2001, was an increase of $67 million of net revenue and $29 million of cost of products which were included in the cumulative effect adjustment. The results for the first three quarters of 2001 have been restated in accordance with SAB 101. Pro forma amounts for the year ended October 31, 2000 have not been presented, as the effect of the change could not be reasonably determined. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 142 under which goodwill will no longer be amortized but reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. We adopted SFAS No. 142 on November 1, 2002. Subsequently, we are required to evaluate our existing goodwill and intangible assets and make any necessary reclassification in order to comply with the new criteria in SFAS No. 142. Based on our assessment, effective in the first quarter of 2003, approximately $6 million of intangible assets associated with workforce in place will be reclassified to goodwill. As part of our assessment, we used the fair value measurement requirement, rather than the previously required undiscounted cash flows approach, and as a result we expect to record a transitional impairment loss from the implementation of SFAS No. 142 as a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2003. The fair value of the reporting units was determined primarily by the income approach, which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows. The first step evaluation of reporting units on a fair value basis, as required by SFAS No. 142, indicated that an impairment exists in the communications solutions reporting unit within our test and measurement business. The revenue forecasts of the communications solutions reporting unit have been impacted by the prolonged economic downturn in the communications test markets. We were required to perform the second step analysis to determine the amount of the impairment loss for the reporting unit that failed the first step test. The second step analysis consisted of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill, with an impairment charge resulting from any excess of the carrying value of the 37 Table of Contents reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. Based upon this evaluation, the pre tax impairment is expected to be $268 million, approximately 44 percent of total consolidated goodwill recorded as of October 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 is also expected to have a material impact on our results of operations because goodwill will no longer be amortized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Amortization of goodwill was $326 million in 2002, $303 million in 2001 and $64 million in 2000. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144). SFAS No. 144 amends existing accounting guidance on asset impairment and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of. Among other provisions, the new rules change the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale. The standard also broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations, and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations. We will adopt SFAS No. 144 in the first quarter of 2003. We do not believe that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, which nullifies EITF No. 94 3. SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability be recognized for restructuring costs only when the liability is incurred, that is, when it meets the definition of a liability in the FASBs conceptual framework. SFAS No. 146 also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities and is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with earlier adoption encouraged. The effect of adoption is dependent on the timing of our related restructuring activities; however, we do not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 146 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Acquisitions On January 5, 2001, we acquired Objective Systems Integrators, Inc. (OSI) for approximately $716 million. Of this total, $690 million was cash and the remainder represents the fair value of options granted. Using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations (APB No. 16), the purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets including goodwill. The original goodwill balance of $593 million was being amortized over three years. The net book value of goodwill associated with this acquisition at October 31, 2002 was $234 million. At the time of acquisition, OSI was a leading provider of next generation operations support system software for communications service providers and has become part of our test and measurement business. In July 1999, Hewlett Packard entered into an agreement with Yokogawa Electric Corporation (Yokogawa) to acquire Yokogawas 25 percent equity interest in Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. for approximately $521 million (the Yokogawa Purchase). The acquisition was done in several steps. In the initial step, which occurred in January 2000, we purchased approximately 10 percent of Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. shares from Yokogawa for approximately $206 million. In the second step, which occurred in April 2000, we purchased approximately 11 percent of additional Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. shares from Yokogawa for approximately $216 million. In January 2001, we completed the Yokogawa Purchase by purchasing the remaining 4 percent interest for approximately $99 million. Of the total purchase price, $243 million was allocated to tangible assets and $278 million was attributed to goodwill and was being amortized over ten years. The remaining net book value of goodwill associated with this acquisition was $205 million at October 31, 2002. In addition to the OSI acquisition and the Yokogawa Purchase, we acquired several other companies during 2002, 2001 and 2000, which were not significant to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting as defined in APB No. 16 or SFAS No. 141 depending on the date of acquisition. The results of operations of the acquired companies were included prospectively from the date of acquisition and the acquisition cost was allocated to the acquired tangible assets and 38 Table of Contents liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on fair values at the date of acquisition. Residual amounts were recorded as goodwill. In process research and development write offs have not been significant. Unaudited pro forma statement of operations information has not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material on either an individual or an aggregated basis. The net book value of goodwill was $610 million at October 31, 2002 and $944 million at October 31, 2001. Goodwill related to acquisitions completed prior to June 30, 2001 was amortized over periods ranging from three to ten years. Effective in the first quarter of 2003, goodwill will no longer be amortized, in accordance with our adoption of SFAS No. 142. The aggregate amount of goodwill impairment losses was $12 million in 2002, $8 million in 2001 and insignificant in 2000. See further discussion in New Accounting Pronouncements above. Amortization of purchased intangible assets was $52 million in 2002, $41 million in 2001 and $7 million in 2000. The carrying amount of purchased intangibles was $75 million as of October 31, 2002. Effective in the first quarter of 2003, approximately $6 million of workforce in place will be reclassified from intangible assets to goodwill. The remaining intangible assets of $69 million will be amortized as follows: $46 million in 2003 and $23 million in 2004. Discontinued Operations On August 1, 2001, we completed the sale of our healthcare solutions business to Koninklijke Philips Electronics, N.V. (Philips) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement for a total purchase price of $1.7 billion. Philips paid initial proceeds of $1.6 billion to us on August 1, 2001, with further payments following pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of November 17, 2000, as amended and supplemented by the Amendment and Supplemental Agreement, dated as of August 1, 2001 (collectively, the Asset Purchase Agreement). The total purchase price was subject to adjustment based on the determination of the final purchased net assets and on our performance of integration services for Philips. Our consolidated financial statements reflect our healthcare solutions business as discontinued operations in accordance with APB Opinion No. 30 Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions (APB No. 30). The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our healthcare solutions business have been classified as discontinued and prior periods have been restated, including the reallocation of general overhead charges to our three remaining business segments. We recorded an after tax gain of $646 million in 2001 and an after tax loss of $10 million in 2002 as a result of the sale to Philips. In 2002, adjustments were made to the gain as a result of purchase price adjustments to reflect the final purchased net assets and additional costs that were not anticipated at the time of the sale. We signed an agreement with Philips, dated as of May 15, 2002, finalizing the purchase price adjustments from the sale. The adjustments did not result in a material adjustment to the gain on sale. Since August 1, 2001, we received all of the $100 million withheld by Philips from the total purchase price at the time of the sale plus adjustments for the final purchased net assets. For incremental fees, we provided support services to Philips after August 1, 2001 and a portion of these fees offset costs that include an element of fixed costs which are recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2001 and 2002. As of October 31, 2002, we have completed our contractual obligation to provide services to Philips. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, we are restricted from competing in the development, manufacturing, selling or servicing of certain medical products for five years after the sale. We do not expect any material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows from this non compete agreement because we do not intend to engage in those specified businesses. 39 Table of Contents Asset Sales Sale of Leasing Portfolio In the fourth quarter of 2000, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with CIT Group Inc. (CIT, formerly Tyco Capital Corporation) pursuant to which we sold them substantially all of our leasing portfolio (the CIT Group Sale) over the course of 2000 and 2001. There was no impact on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations for the CIT Group Sale in 2002. The impact on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations of the CIT Group Sale in the previous two years is shown below. Year Ended Year Ended October 31, 2001 October 31, 2000 (in millions) Net proceeds from the CIT Group Sale $ 287 $ 234 Product revenue 254 197 Cost of products 131 83 We also entered into a vendor financing arrangement with CIT whereby CIT will provide equipment financing and leasing services to our customers on a global basis. This agreement has been in place since the fourth quarter of 2000. In addition to the CIT Group Sale and the sale of the healthcare solutions business, we sold assets related to portions of our businesses to third parties during 2002, 2001 and 2000. Gross proceeds from these dispositions were $31 million in 2002, $13 million in 2001 and insignificant in 2000. Gains from the dispositions, included in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations, were $15 million in 2002, $9 million in 2001 and insignificant in 2000. Sale of San Jose Land In February 2001, we sold a parcel of surplus land in San Jose, California for $287 million in cash, resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately $269 million. In August 2001, we invested in the leasehold of several municipal properties in southern California for a total value of $289 million. In 2002, we received $237 million in non refundable prepaid rent related to the investment in leaseholds as described above. Foreign Currency We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. Our foreign currency exposures are hedged as part of our global risk management program, which is designed to minimize short term exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Movements in exchange rates net of our hedging activities had no material effect on our operations in the periods presented. Effective November 1, 2001, we have determined that the functional currency for many of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. has changed from the U.S. dollar to local currency based on the criteria of SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation. This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position as of November 1, 2001. Results of Continuing Operations Results from operations declined for a second year to a $1,607 million loss in 2002 from a $778 million loss in 2001 and $924 million in earnings in 2000. This trend generally followed the continuing decline in orders to $6,013 million in 2002 from $6,414 million in 2001 and $10,566 million in 2000. In response to declining orders and revenue, beginning in 2001, we took a number of steps to reduce our overall cost structure. We began the 2001 Plan in the fourth quarter of 2001 and continued it through 2002. The 2001 Plan resulted in a workforce reduction of 7,700 including normal attrition, and a further reduction of 2,500 was announced in the 2002 Plan. Primarily as a result of 40 Table of Contents approximately $880 million in restructuring savings from efforts in the 2001 Plan, total costs and expenses declined in 2002 to $7,617 million from $9,174 million in 2001. After adjusting for the differences in inventory charges and the costs of restructuring, total costs and expenses declined approximately $1,458 million year over year in 2002, despite an increase of $89 million related to our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software initiatives in 2002. Although we are cautiously optimistic about the recent growth in our quarterly revenue, with the fourth quarter of 2002 representing our best performance since the third quarter of 2001, quarterly orders remained stagnant at around $1,500 million throughout 2002. We have therefore concluded that we must further reduce our cost structure in 2003 and have announced the 2002 Plan, which began in the fourth quarter of 2002. The effort is designed to reduce our overall cost structure by an additional $50 million per quarter beginning in the second half of 2003. We currently do not expect a major upturn in orders or revenue in the first six months of 2003. We intend to continue to reduce our costs and expenses and reach breakeven in our cash flows from operations in 2003. We also do not expect significant disruptions in our business from completing our ERP and CRM implementations in 2003. We did experience some slowdown and loss of orders during third quarter of 2002 related to our ERP implementation, which we substantially recovered in our fourth quarter. We believe that the risk of future material order and revenue losses is not significant.

Orders in 2001 compared to 2000 declined due to dramatic overall declines in the telecommunications, semiconductor and computer industries. Going into 2003 we will be relying primarily on new products to drive orders growth. 41 Table of Contents Net revenue declined in 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily due to continued weakness in key market segments, particularly wireless and wireline telecommunications, as well as pricing pressures from both customers and competitors in the face of a weak economy. Declines outside the U.S. were slightly lower than domestically in part due to our customers buying infrastructure products in Asia. Continued slow markets in communications drove declines in product revenue; declines in service revenue were driven by reduced contract renewal rates as an increasingly large portion of our customers have elected to receive service on a time and materials basis. Services and other includes revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products, warranty extensions and consulting in all years, in addition to operating lease revenue in 2001 and 2000. Excluding the CIT Group Sale of $254 million in 2001 and $197 million in 2000, net revenue for 2001 decreased 11 percent compared to 2000. The decrease related primarily to the slowdown in the telecommunications, semiconductor and computer industries, which severely impacted our customers ability to purchase our products. The decrease in domestic net revenue for 2001 came primarily from our businesses that serve the communications and electronics markets; the slowdown in those markets impacted our net revenue in the U.S. somewhat more severely than other parts of the world. The decrease in product revenue for 2001 was driven primarily by the slowdown in communications and electronics markets. The decline in service revenue for 2001 was primarily the result of the CIT Group Sale and the decline in service contract renewal rates. Generally, there is a lag between service revenue trends and product revenue trends; this lag occurs because service revenue is directly related to the size of our installed base of products not covered by warranty. Costs and Expenses Years Ended October 31, 2002 over 2001 2001 over 2000 As a % of Net Revenue 2002 2001 2000 Ppts Change Ppts Change Cost of products as a percentage of product revenue 62% 59% 49% 3 10 Cost of services and other as a percentage of services and other revenue 58% 50% 51% 8 (1 ) Total costs as a percentage of total net revenue 61% 58% 49% 3 9 Research and development 19% 15% 11% 4 4 Selling, general and administrative 46% 36% 30% 10 6 Cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2002 compared to 2001, despite decreases in the actual dollar amounts of costs, due to the steep decline in revenue we experienced this year. Our fixed costs relating to continued overcapacity increase as a percentage of net revenue with any decline in net revenue. Savings in dollar terms were primarily the result of the 2001 Plan, which yielded approximately $325 million of savings in cost of products and services for the year, and reduced inventory charges. Excluding the CIT Group Sale and restructuring charges of $79 million in 2001, cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue for 2001 increased 10 percentage points compared to 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to decreased sales volume and increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory. During 2001, cost of products as a percentage of product revenue increased due to the same factors mentioned above and higher discounts offered to our customers. Discount increases affected the majority of our products and were the result of pressure from competitors and customers in the face of a declining economy. Inventory charges totaled $40 million in 2002 compared to $459 million in 2001 and $70 million in 2000. The abnormally high charges in 2001 compared to 2000 and 2002 were the result of the rapid and steep market decline that year, which caused excess inventory of then current products and hastened the obsolescence of older products. Inventory charges in 2001 spanned the vast majority of our products as well as raw materials. Additional charges in 2002 reflected continuing weakness in 42 Table of Contents some of our largest markets, particularly telecommunications, but were partially offset by the sale of inventory previously written off in our semiconductor product lines. Research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2002 compared to 2001 as a direct result of decreased revenue; in 2001 compared to 2000 research and development expenses increased in both dollar terms and as a percentage of net revenue as a result of continuing expenditures toward new product introductions, many of which helped to offset our revenue losses in the current year. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. We conduct five types of research and development: basic research, which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future; foundation technologies research, which enables fundamental advances across all businesses; communications research, which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information; life sciences research, which enables next generation pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes; and measurement research, which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems. Our research improves on various technical competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices, digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies; systems and solutions such as applied mathematics, knowledge management and measurement science; life sciences such as computational biology, molecular diagnostics and high throughput measurements; and photonics, such as precision automation technology, optical switching and high speed optical links. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short term and other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time horizon. A significant portion of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than 20,000 products already in production, and other research is on major new product releases. Because of the large number of new and existing products and research and development projects across all of our businesses, it is difficult to quantify the impact of any specific products or projects. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2002 compared to 2001, despite reductions in overall spending, due to the significant decline in net revenue. Overall our spending on selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 was $250 million lower than in 2001, despite an increase of approximately $89 million in expense for our ERP and CRM systems as a result of savings from the 2001 Plan. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to goodwill amortization relating to our 2001 acquisition of OSI. As a result of various expense control initiatives in 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses before the effect of goodwill and other intangible amortization, restructuring and asset impairment charges declined 12 percent compared to 2000. (Loss) Earnings from Operations Years Ended October 31, 2002 over 2001 2001 over 2000 2002 2001 2000 Change Change (in millions) (Loss) earnings from operations $ (1,607 ) $ (778 ) $ 924 (107)% (184)% Operating (deficit) margin (27 )% (9 )% 10 % (18) points (19) points Our increased loss from operations in 2002 compared to 2001 was a direct result of the decline in revenue that we experienced, as well as increases in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to restructuring. However, we demonstrated considerable success in realigning our businesses to the weakened economic conditions; the increase of $829 million in our loss from operations was less than 35 percent of our total revenue decline of $2,386 million. Excluding the CIT Group Sale, we had a loss from operations of $901 million in 2001 compared to earnings from operations of $810 million in 2000. Excluding the restructuring charges and the CIT 43 Table of Contents Group Sale, we had a loss from operations of $447 million in 2001 compared to earnings from operations of $925 million in 2000. The decrease in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the fact that net revenue declined much more rapidly than costs and expenses in the test and measurement and semiconductor businesses. Increased goodwill amortization related to recent acquisitions also contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by the performance of our life sciences and chemical analysis business. Other Income (Expense), Net Years Ended October 31, 2002 over 2001 2001 over 2000 2002 2001 2000 % Change % Change (in millions) Other income (expense), net $ 60 $ 301 $ 94 (80)% 220% Excluding the $269 million impact of the sale of land in San Jose, California in 2001, other income (expense), net increased $28 million in 2002 compared to 2001. This net increase was due to: $45 million from reduced losses on equity investments, $31 million from increased interest income from cash deposits and reduced interest expense due to the pay down of commercial paper and $6 million from gains from dispositions. These increases were partially offset by: $35 million due to interest payable on convertible debt issued in 2002, $4 million due to currency movement and $15 million due to various items, none of which was individually material. Other income (expense), net increased $207 million in 2001 over 2000. The increase was primarily due to the sale of land in San Jose, California, which resulted in a pre tax gain of $269 million. The increase in other income (expense), net for 2001 compared to 2000 was partially offset by higher interest expense due to a higher average debt balance. We sold assets related to portions of our businesses to third parties during 2002, 2001 and 2000. Gross proceeds from these dispositions were $31 million in 2002, $13 million in 2001 and insignificant in 2000. Gains from the dispositions, included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations, were $15 million in 2002, $9 million in 2001 and insignificant in 2000. (Benefit) Provision for Taxes The effective tax benefit rate for continuing operations in 2002 was 34 percent. For 2001 and 2000, the effective rates were 19 percent and 34 percent, respectively. In 2002, the higher benefit tax rate was due to the relatively higher loss from continuing operations in 2002 than in 2001. In 2001 compared to 2000, the change in the tax rate for continuing operations was due to the tax benefits arising from the losses caused by the global economic downturn of that year. Taxes on the sale of our healthcare solutions business in 2001 were reflected in the gain from sale of discontinued operations. Our future effective tax rate will continue to be calculated using our pre tax earnings or loss and will be affected by additional research and development tax credits, the expected level of other tax benefits, the effects of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as changes in the mix of our pre tax earnings among jurisdictions with varying statutory rates. Segment Results For 2002, we changed the method by which we allocate corporate expenses to the segments. Prior period (loss) earnings from operations have been restated accordingly. Management measures the profitability of each of the business segments after excluding goodwill and other intangible amortization and non recurring items such as restructuring charges; these items have been excluded for all periods presented. 44 Table of Contents Test and Measurement Our test and measurement business provides standard and customized solutions that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronic equipment and systems and communications networks and services. Overall orders activity over the last 12 quarters indicates that the markets for our test and measurement products were fairly consistent throughout 2000, dropped dramatically during 2001 and have remained depressed in 2002 with some unusually steep quarterly variations through the year. Within the business, orders trends were mixed, with our automated test products showing a slight rebound in 2002 compared to 2001 while the other product lines trended downward similarly to the overall results for the business. Generally speaking, declines in both years were the result of a weak market for telecommunications products, with offsetting growth in 2002 driven by orders from semiconductor contract manufacturers in the U.S. and Asia, particularly for our system on a chip products. Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2002 over 2001 2001 over 2000 2002 2001 2000 Change Change (in millions) Orders $ 3,294 $ 4,021 $ 7,002 (18)% (43)% Net revenue from products $ 2,791 $ 4,763 $ 5,299 (41)% (10)% Net revenue from services and other 527 669 809 (21)% (17)% Total net revenue $ 3,318 $ 5,432 $ 6,108 (39)% (11)% (Loss) earnings from operations (837 ) (120 ) 756 (598)% (116)% Operating margin (deficit) (25 )% (2 )% 12 % (23) point s (14) point s The declines in orders in 2002 compared to 2001 and in 2001 compared to 2000 followed overall trends in the markets where this business focuses its sales, and were driven primarily by weakness in the telecommunications market. However, despite the declines over the prior two years we feel well positioned going into 2003, as we have made major strides toward stabilization since implementing our Enterprise Resource Planning software platform and our products are well positioned to take advantage of the growth anticipated in China as that market continues to open in the near future. Generally speaking, the outlook for wireless communications test products is beginning to improve, while wireline products are anticipated to have a difficult year and we expect the market for general purpose test products to be mixed. Overall, we will rely on new products for orders growth in the coming year, both to take share in limited new market opportunities and to gain share in larger existing markets. The decline in net revenue for 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily the result of the slowdown in the telecommunications industry, as was the decline in 2001 compared to 2000. The slowdown was particularly sharp in the second half of 2001 as we became increasingly dependent on incoming orders, which declined in virtually all of the product lines of our test and measurement businesses. Excluding the CIT Group Sale, total net revenue for 2001 declined 12 percent compared to 2000. Pricing pressures from customers and competitors including sales of used equipment by customers either downsizing or going out of business also contributed to the decline in revenue in 2002 compared to 2001. Overall discounts have increased by approximately 4 percentage points since the beginning of 2001, resulting in approximately $150 million less revenue in 2002 compared to 2001. Our percentage of revenue from new products increased approximately 20 percentage points since early 2001; in 2002 we introduced more than 100 new products, nearly a quarter of which have significant strategic and financial impact on our business. These new products include vector network analyzers, optical electrical generators, performance signal analyzers and automated performance characterization testing products. Net revenue from services and other declined less dramatically than product revenue in 2002 compared to 2001 despite customers increasingly moving away from contracts and towards service on a time and materials basis; service revenue is generally 45 Table of Contents more stable than product revenue in difficult market conditions as our installed base of products continues to generate service needs. Net revenue from services and other decreased more dramatically than net revenue from products for 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to the CIT Group Sale. In addition, a number of customers chose not to renew their service contracts in 2001 in response to cost constraints due to the difficult economic conditions that year. Costs and Expenses The following table shows the percentage point increase in our test and measurement business costs and expenses as a percentage of net revenue for 2002, 2001 and 2000. 2002 over 2001 2001 over 2000 Increase as a % of Net Revenue Ppts Change Ppts Change Cost of products and services 3 9 Research and development 7 3 Selling, general and administrative 13 2 Cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2002 over 2001 primarily due to the overall decrease in net revenue. On a dollar basis, costs were down 35 percent for the year, driven primarily by savings from restructuring and reduced inventory charges. Cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory. Excluding the impact of inventory charges, cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased 3 percentage points in 2001 from 2000. Due to the fixed nature of our manufacturing costs, lower than anticipated manufacturing volumes contributed to the increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. Inventory charges totaled $54 million in 2002 compared to $364 million in 2001 and $57 million in 2000. The large increase from 2000 to 2001 was the result of rapidly deteriorating conditions in the telecommunications and electronics markets; the charges affected parts for the majority of all product types. Additional charges in 2002 are closer to our run rate in 2000, and particularly reflect continuing weakness in the communications test market even beyond our expectations at the end of 2001. Inventory charges in 2002 primarily affected optical communications measurement products, demo inventory and raw materials. Research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2002 from 2001 due to the overall decrease in net revenue. On a dollar basis, expenses were down 10 percent for the year, predominantly as a result of restructuring and from delays and reductions in new product introductions that would otherwise have been developed for near term release. Specifically, our research and development funding has been refocused to take advantage of the markets that are beginning to recover from the declines or stagnation of the last several quarters, while reductions have been targeted to products in markets that are particularly weak and not expected to recover in the near term, such as wireline telecommunications. The increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to our continuing expenditures toward new product introductions that were anticipated to generate material contributions to revenue in future periods, combined with the decrease in overall net revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to the overall decrease in net revenue. On a dollar basis, expenses were down 16 percent primarily as a result of restructuring. In 2001 selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue were flat compared to 2000. 46 Table of Contents (Loss) Earnings from Operations Our reduced revenue drove the increase in loss from operations in 2002 compared to 2001; weak sales overcame significant new product wins and restructuring savings during the year. However, the fact that losses increased only $1,027 million after removing the impact of reduced inventory charges, compared to reduced revenue of $2,114, is a sign that our restructuring efforts have had significant success in reducing our overall cost structure. The 2001 Plan saved approximately $600 million in 2002 and we reduced average headcount by 11 percent. The 2002 Plan will be focused on achieving breakeven or profitability for the business in 2003, including an additional reduction in average headcount of 8 percent and incremental savings of approximately $40 million per quarter by the end of the year. The savings will result from both the reduction in employee related costs and from shifting manufacturing and sales into lower cost regions. Loss from operations in 2001 was a result of reduced demand, which led to fewer sales and increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory. Excluding the CIT Group Sale, loss from operations was $242 million compared to earnings from operations of $644 million in 2000. Semiconductor Products Our semiconductor products business is a leading supplier of semiconductor components, modules and assemblies for high performance communications systems. We design, develop and manufacture products for the networking and personal systems markets. Overall orders activity over the last 12 quarters indicates that the markets for our semiconductor products declined slightly during 2000, dropped dramatically during 2001 with an abnormally low bottom point near the middle of the year, and improved again gradually in 2002. The average for 2002 was just under two thirds the average in 2000. Underlying market conditions remain little changed in 2002 compared to 2001, including continuing pricing pressure on the orders we book, which is demonstrated by our steadily declining revenue for the same comparison periods despite the orders increase in the current year. Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2002 over 2001 2001 over 2000 2002 2001 2000 Change Change (in millions) Orders $ 1,568 $ 1,290 $ 2,511 22% (49)% Net revenue $ 1,559 $ 1,850 $ 2,213 (16)% (16)% (Loss) earnings from operations (68 ) (177 ) 229 62% (177)% Operating (deficit) margin (4 )% (10 )% 10 % 6 points (20) point s The overall increase in orders for 2002 compared to 2001 was the result of growth in our personal systems product lines, partially offset by reductions in our networking product lines. In personal systems, we saw orders growth of 50 percent for our imaging products and 33 percent for general optoelectronic components while orders for our wireless products were flat from the prior year. In networking, our optical products declined 11 percent compared to the prior year while our smaller overall orders for integrated circuits grew 20 percent. There is still no indication of stabilization in the telecommunications market, but other markets for our networking products show potential for growth in the coming year. The decline in orders for 2001 compared to 2000 was a direct reflection of the steep and rapid decline in the semiconductor products marketplace that year. Looking forward, geographical trends in orders show growth in Asia as an increasing number of companies shift manufacturing out of North America and Europe into mainland China and Southeast Asia. The decrease in net revenue for 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily the result of the carryover of revenue into 2001 from relatively high orders in 2000. During 2001, the timing difference between orders and revenue became much smaller, resulting in lower carryover of revenue into 2002. Non 47 Table of Contents recurring royalty revenue relating to changes in our agreement with Adaptec Inc. in 2001 also contributed $35 million to the decrease in the comparison between 2002 and 2001. The decrease in net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the sharp decline in demand for our semiconductor products. The global economic slowdown led to lower volumes in virtually all product lines of the business. Revenue from sales to Hewlett Packard, consisting primarily of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and motion control products, represented approximately 33 percent of the business total net revenue for 2002, 31 percent of net revenue for 2001 and 30 percent of net revenue for 2000. No individual new products had a material impact on results in 2002; we are seeing good customer acceptance of our F BAR and E pHEMT wireless products, but those items are not yet showing a material impact on results. Costs and Expenses The following table shows the percentage point increase or decrease in our semiconductor products business costs and expenses as a percentage of its net revenue for 2002, 2001 and 2000. 2002 over 2001 2001 over 2000 Increase (decrease) as a % of Net Revenue Ppts Change Ppts Change Cost of products (6 ) 11 Research and development 6 Selling, general and administrative 1 3 The decrease in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue in 2002 compared to 2001 despite overall reduced revenue was a direct result of the 2001 Plan; savings from restructuring reduced total cost of products by approximately $170 million for the year. The increase in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 was due in part to increased inventory charges for excess and obsolete inventory. In addition to increases from inventory charges, lower than anticipated manufacturing volumes contributed to the increase in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue due to the fixed nature of our manufacturing costs, as the product lines in this business are particularly capital intensive. Unfavorable mix and large shipments to single customers carrying deep discounts impacted cost of products as a percentage of net revenue unfavorably. Excluding the impact of increased inventory charges, cost of products as a percentage of net revenue for 2001 increased 6 percentage points compared to 2000. In 2002 we sold $18 million of inventory previously written down compared to inventory charges of $84 million in 2001 and $4 million in 2000. The sales of written off inventory in the current year were due to unanticipated demand for products previously considered to be unmarketable. The bulk of the unanticipated sales in 2002 were made in image/ navigation, general fiber optics and hardcopy ASICs. The large increase in inventory charges in 2001 compared to 2000 reflected the dramatic decline of market conditions where this business focuses its sales; the charges affected raw materials used in all of our major products, including image/ navigation, telecom fiber optics, general fiber optics, hardcopy ASICs and couplers. Both research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses were flat for 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 was driven by a continued commitment to develop new products in the fiber optics, high speed networking, and image position sensor businesses. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 was the result of declining revenue; the total amount of selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $9 million due to the expense containment measures that we implemented in 2001 prior to restructuring. 48 Table of Contents (Loss) Earnings from Operations The reduced loss from operations in 2002 compared to 2001 was the result of reduced inventory charges and our cost containment measures, including the 2001 Plan. Overall, we reduced average headcount by 13 percent in 2002, in addition to headcount reductions of 12 percent at the end of 2001 compared to the end of 2000. Overall savings from restructuring in 2002 totaled $250 million for the full year. For the 2002 Plan, the business expects to further reduce average headcount in 2003 by about 6 percent; the scope of the restructuring covers all categories of cost and expenses and all regions of operations. When complete, the 2002 Plan is expected to save approximately $10 million per quarter by the end of the year, and is expected to bring the business back to profitability. The loss from operations in 2001 compared to earnings from operations in 2000 resulted primarily from lower net revenue and higher cost of products and expenses as a percentage of net revenue due to the fixed nature of our expenses. Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis Our life sciences and chemical analysis business provides application focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Overall, orders growth over the last 12 quarters has indicated that the markets for our life sciences and chemical analysis products has been slowly but steadily increasing, with some regular seasonality patterns that recur predictably each year. Due to U.S. government and large pharmaceutical budgets, orders in our first and fourth quarters are seasonally greater than those in our second and third quarters. However, general economic trends, new product introductions and competition might overshadow this trend in any given year. In 2002, the primary driver for growth in life sciences products revenue was strong acceptance of new products, with some offsetting declines in the pharmaceuticals market. The primary drivers of revenue growth in chemical analysis for 2002 were U.S. government spending and Asian economic development. Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2002 over 2001 2001 over 2000 2002 2001 2000 Change Change (in millions) Orders $ 1,151 $ 1,103 $ 1,053 4% 5% Net revenue from products $ 884 $ 872 $ 788 1% 11% Net revenue from services and other 249 242 252 3% (4)% Total net revenue $ 1,133 $ 1,114 $ 1,040 2% 7% Earnings from operations 150 91 10 65% 810% Operating margin 13 % 8 % 1 % 5 points 7 points The increase in orders in 2002 compared to 2001 was driven by government spending in the U.S. and abroad, growth in new technology areas such as microarrays and Chemchip and the growth of the chemical analysis market. In our life sciences markets, new technologies drove improved orders performance, while our pharmaceuticals customers continued to reduce orders this year. In our chemical analysis markets, U.S. government spending on homeland security and Asian government spending on infrastructure were the primary growth areas. Orders in Asia grew 12 percent this year, primarily for products in the environmental and foods markets. The increase in orders in 2001 compared to 2000 was the result of the overall steady upward market trend in life sciences and chemical analysis products. We expect that recently and soon to be released new products will continue to produce orders growth in the coming year. The increase in net revenue for 2002 compared to 2001 was a result of increased sales in both our life sciences products and our chemical analysis products. In life sciences, increased revenue was 49 Table of Contents driven by growth in new technology areas such as microarrays and Chemchip, but overall weakness in pharmaceutical industry spending continues. New products contributed significantly to our performance in 2002; revenue for new products was approximately $80 to $90 million for the year, primarily for microarrays and microarray systems, Chemchip applications and systems and new liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry applications. The increase in net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 was the result of increased sales of our products in the life sciences market moderated by decreased sales of our products in our traditional chemical and petrochemical markets. Net revenue from products including liquid chromatography equipment, bioanalyzers and microarrays grew more than 20 percent in 2001 compared to 2000. Services and other revenue decreased slightly in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily as a result of customers choosing to receive services on a time and materials basis rather than renewing long term service contracts, a common trend in the face of difficult economic times. Costs and Expenses The following table shows the percentage point decrease in our life sciences and chemical analysis business costs and expenses as a percentage of its net revenue for 2002, 2001 and 2000. 2002 over 2001 2001 over 2000 Decrease as a % of Net Revenue Ppts Change Ppts Change Cost of products and services (3 ) (2 ) Research and development (1 ) Selling, general and administrative (2 ) (5 ) Cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was down slightly in 2002 compared to 2001. Tight expense management and cost reductions, improved management of inventories and reductions in infrastructure expenses this year drove a $17 million decrease in total spending. Cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was flat in 2001 compared to 2000; additional depreciation expense related to increased spending in manufacturing capacity for microarrays was offset by cost controls and improved operational efficiencies. Inventory charges totaled $4 million in 2002 compared to $11 million in 2001 and $9 million in 2000. The slightly increased inventory charge run rate in 2001 compared to both 2000 and 2002 was due to overall inventory reductions in the face of the difficult economy and some consolidation of warehouses to increase efficiency. The life sciences and chemical analysis business did not participate significantly in the 2001 Plan until the fourth quarter of 2002, when we took steps to consolidate our facilities in California. In order to minimize moving expense and capital investments in existing space, we will outsource components of the manufacturing process. For the 2002 Plan, our restructuring efforts will be focused on improving the manufacturability and quality of our products. Research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue were flat for both 2002 compared to 2001 and 2001 compared to 2000. Steady spending on research and development is required to produce new products that can improve revenues and market share in future years. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue were flat in 2002 compared to 2001; the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue for 2001 compared to 2000 reflected our efforts to reduce cost structures and discretionary expenses. Earnings from Operations The increase in earnings from operations in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to increased revenue and continued cost controls. Overall, cost controls, inventory management and infrastructure reductions contributed approximately $20 million to our bottom line for the year. The increase in earnings from operations in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to higher net 50 Table of Contents revenue and reduced spending resulting from our cost reduction measures. In addition, operational efficiencies arising out of manufacturing centralization efforts begun in fiscal 2000 and increased volumes contributed to the increase. Healthcare Solutions Discontinued Operations Our healthcare solutions business has been classified as a discontinued operation. The table below shows the results of our healthcare solutions business before general overhead allocations and net of the costs of divestiture. Results for the year ended October 31, 2001 include operations from November 1, 2000 to May 31, 2001, the measurement date in accordance with APB No. 30. The net loss from discontinued operations of $58 million for the two month period following our May 31, 2001 measurement date was included in the gain from sale of discontinued operations. The after tax gain resulting from the sale of our healthcare solutions business including this loss was $646 million. The following table shows the detailed results of operations of our discontinued healthcare solutions business for 2001 and 2000. These results are also included in our consolidated statement of operations as net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended 2001 and 2000. Years Ended October 31, 2001(a) 2000 (in millions) Net revenue $ 765 $ 1,412 Costs and expenses 747 1,283 Earnings from discontinued operations 18 129 Other income (expense), net 3 17 Earnings from discontinued operations before taxes 21 146 Provision for taxes 15 61 Net earnings from discontinued operations $ 6 $ 85 (a) Includes operations from November 1, 2000 to May 31, 2001, the measurement date. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial position remained strong at October 31, 2002, with cash and cash equivalents of $1,844 million. We used cash from continuing operations of $585 million in 2002 compared to $114 million used in 2001 and $536 million generated in 2000. Of the $585 million cash used in operations in 2002, $235 million was spent on restructuring activities, primarily in the form of severance payments. Inventory related charges were significantly lower in 2002 than in the previous year at $40 million compared to $459 million a year ago. The abnormally high charges in 2001 compared to 2000 and 2002 were the result of the rapid and steep market decline that year, which caused excess inventory of then current products and hastened the obsolescence of older products. As demand for our products generally declined in 2002, we have been able to manufacture more products using inventory on hand and have reduced the amounts that we have purchased from suppliers. An 8 percent increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to the same quarter in 2001 was the primary cause of a 14 percent increase in accounts receivable at the end of 2002 as compared to the prior year. At the end of fiscal 2001 accounts receivable had decreased by about 50 percent compared to the end of fiscal 2000, primarily due to a 47 percent decline in fiscal 2001 fourth quarter revenues as compared to the fourth quarter of 2000. There were no material bad debt charges in any of the years presented. The net amount of cash used in the reduction of accounts 51 Table of Contents payable declined from $480 million in 2001 to $89 million in 2002. This trend is generally consistent with the decrease in our operating expenses. In 2002, $84 million of cash was used to fund our U.S. defined benefit plans and $105 million was contributed to our international defined benefit plans. This years contributions were approximately $128 million or 210 percent larger than in the previous year due primarily to a decline in equity markets globally. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. If the value of our assets declines relative to our future projected obligations, we have to make larger contributions to maintain our funded status. In 2003, we expect to fund our retirement plans in approximately the same amounts as in 2002. We currently have over $1 billion of deferred tax assets. The significant increase in deferred tax assets for 2002 is due primarily to net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs), foreign tax credits and research and development tax credits. We expect to utilize the NOLs, foreign tax credits and research and development tax credits to reduce future tax liabilities when we return to profitability. Our need to control discretionary spending and conserve cash in the face of the weak economy has significantly reduced the amounts we considered to be available for investments such as new company acquisitions, equity investments and property, plant and equipment. Net cash used by investing activities for 2002 was $71 million compared to $1,365 million in 2001 and $1,062 million in 2000. In 2002, we used $15 million to purchase equity in strategically aligned companies. In 2001 we spent $904 million, primarily for the acquisition of OSI and for the Yokagawa Purchase. In 2000 we used $634 million for the first and second installments of the Yokagawa Purchase along with investments in several other companies. In 2001, we used cash of $289 million for a long term leasehold investment on which the lessee prepaid $237 million of rent in 2002. Capital spending controls imposed in the fourth quarter of 2001 reduced spending on property, plant and equipment by $580 million in 2002 compared to the prior year. In 2002 the majority of property, plant and equipment purchases were related to the implementations of our ERP and CRM systems and to the development of our website. The total program costs for these three initiatives were $281 million in 2002 compared to $164 million in 2001. Of these amounts, we capitalized $148 million in 2002 and $91 million in 2001 and the remainder was expensed. We estimate that the total program cost in 2003 for these initiatives will be approximately $160 million. Although these programs used significant resources in 2002 and 2001, when they are completed we will be able to retire over 1000 legacy systems, resulting in significant savings. We had no material dispositions of property, plant and equipment in 2002 compared to $633 million in 2001 related to the sale of land in San Jose and the CIT Group Sale. In November 2001, we borrowed $1,123 million, net of issuance costs, under a private offering of 3 percent senior convertible debentures due in 2021. A registration statement filed on behalf of certain holders of the debentures became effective on April 11, 2002. The debentures are convertible at any time into our common stock at an initial conversion price of $32.22 per share, subject to adjustment (as defined in the related Indenture agreement dated November 27, 2001) and are redeemable at our option at any time on or after December 6, 2004. Holders of the debentures have the ability to require us to repurchase the debentures, in whole or in part, on specified dates in 2006, 2011 and 2016. Holders also have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the outstanding debentures if we undergo a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture agreement) at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount plus interest. The debentures bear interest at an annual rate of 3 percent, payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year beginning June 1, 2002. The interest rate will reset (as defined in the Indenture agreement) in June 2006, June 2011 and June 2016, but in no event will it be reset below 3 percent or above 5 percent per annum. More information regarding the terms of the debentures, including conversion price, Fundamental Change and the interest rate reset can be found in the Indenture agreement. 52 Table of Contents On August 1, 2001 we completed the sale of our healthcare solutions business to Phillips for initial proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion. In May of 2002 we finalized the sale agreement. We received $1.6 billion in August of 2001 and since then we have received all of the $100 million withheld by Philips from the total purchase price at the time of the sale plus adjustments for the final purchased net assets. Cash flows from discontinued operations include the proceeds from the sale and cash used in the operations of the healthcare solutions business during the year up until the date of sale. We have terminated our $250 million five year revolving credit facility that was due to expire on November 5, 2005 and have not extended the $250 million 364 day revolving credit facility that terminated on November 1, 2002. We had no outstanding balances under these credit facilities during 2002. We did not have plans to use these credit facilities, and we believe that the costs of renewing and or retaining these credit facilities outweighed their benefits. We continue to have access to uncommitted credit lines through our banking partners, although we do not anticipate any significant additional credit needs in the next year. In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual commitments to purchase materials and components from suppliers in exchange for favorable pricing or more beneficial terms. These regular purchase agreements did not exceed 5 percent of cost of sales. We have contractual commitments to non cancelable operating leases and vendor financing arrangements with CIT. We provide lease guarantees on these financing arrangements and we have no other material guarantees or commitments. See Note 16, Other Accrued Liabilities in Item 15 of this report for further information on lease guarantees. See Note 18, Commitments in Item 15 of this report for further information on our non cancelable operating leases. We are taking actions to achieve positive cash flows from operations in 2003. We will benefit from significant cost savings through our restructuring programs and we have plans to further improve our collection of accounts receivable and lower our inventory levels. Inventory levels already have been reduced by over $400 million from two years ago. This represents major progress in a key area of our asset performance. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal operating cash flow patterns of our businesses and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economies and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in a number of locations throughout the world, and in some cases tax rules and regulations could restrict our ability to move cash balances from one jurisdiction to meet cash requirements in another jurisdiction without incurring tax penalties. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and other borrowing capabilities will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and other liquidity needs for 2003. Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results Our operating results and financial condition could continue to be harmed if the industries into which we sell our products, such as the communications, electronics and semiconductor industries, remain depressed. The economic downturn resulted in reduced purchasing and capital spending in many of the markets that we serve worldwide. In particular, the communications, semiconductor and electronics industries have been in a downward cycle characterized by diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and the increasing erosion of average selling prices. Although some segments of these industries have shown recent signs of stabilization, others, especially in communications, continue to exhibit a downward cycle. There has been year over year orders growth in our semiconductor products, life sciences and chemical analysis, semiconductor test and wireless test businesses, but demand in these markets remains volatile so the underlying trend is uncertain. In addition, our 53 Table of Contents businesses serving wireline telecommunications markets have continued to decline. Pricing pressures intensified throughout 2002, reducing our gross margins. We are uncertain how long the current downturn will last and when a sustained recovery in our markets may occur. Any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, if our customers markets continue to decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such further decline could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our ability to reach our goals for restoring profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could continue, and if we are unable to respond quickly enough this could negatively impact our gross margins. Finally, we may be required to secure additional debt or equity financing at some time in the future, and we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms when required. The actions we took in response to the reduced demand for our products and services could have long term adverse effects on our business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2001, our revenue started declining. To scale back our operations and to reduce our expenses in response to this decreased demand for our products and services and lower revenue, we reduced our workforce, froze hiring, cut back significantly on our use of temporary workers and reduced discretionary spending. We also initiated short term facility closures to reduce production levels. In calendar year 2001, we announced plans to reduce our workforce by approximately 8,000 people. This reduction was completed at the end of the fourth quarter of 2002. In connection with our announcement of our results for the quarter ended July 31, 2002, we announced that to reach our profitability goals we will have to reduce costs by approximately another $50 million per quarter. This entails approximately 2,500 additional job cuts, which are underway. In addition, from May 1 to October 31 of 2001, we instituted a 10 percent pay reduction applicable to all employees globally, wherever legally permissible. Starting in the first quarter of 2002, we continued the 10 percent pay reduction for approximately 2,000 of our senior managers. In February of 2002, we reinstated the pay reduction at a rate of 5 percent for our other employees, wherever legally permissible. The reductions in pay took effect via a reduction in hours for certain employees, in accordance with local law. In addition to these measures, we are continuing our initiatives to streamline our operations. The pay reductions continued throughout our third quarter. Starting August 1, 2002, we restored full pay to all employees worldwide, which increases the pressure to reach our profitability goals. There are several risks inherent in our efforts to transition to a reduced cost structure. These include the risk that we will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough and sustain them at a level necessary to restore profitability, and that we may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges. For example, prior to the third quarter of 2002, we had not anticipated the necessity for the further restructuring initiatives to reduce costs by another $50 million per quarter. In addition, there is the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products and remain competitive in the industries in which we compete. Each of the above measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, making it more difficult for us to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be. As demand for our products does not match our manufacturing capacity, our earnings may continue to suffer. Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufactur 54 Table of Contents ing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. Currently, we have excess manufacturing capacity as a result of the decrease in purchasing and capital spending in the communications, electronics and semiconductor industries. The fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our earnings. Conversely, if during a market upturn we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner, which in turn may have a negative effect on our earnings and overall business. Failure to adjust our orders for parts and inventories due to changing market conditions could adversely affect our earnings. Our earnings could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our orders for parts to market fluctuations. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts as demand for our communications, semiconductor and electronics products has decreased. For example, in the year ended October 31, 2001, we incurred approximately $459 million of inventory related charges, and in the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, we have incurred approximately another $40 million in inventory related charges. If the demand for our products continues to decrease, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges. By contrast, during a market upturn, our results could be materially and adversely impacted if we cannot increase our inventories quickly enough to meet increasing demand for our products. Approximately 5 percent of our parts require custom work. Of these, some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers, due to their unique nature or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacture of such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. We are continuing to implement new information systems, and problems with the design or implementation of these new systems have interfered and could further interfere with our operations. We are in the process of implementing new information systems to eventually replace our current systems, which are largely based on legacy systems that were created when we were a part of Hewlett Packard. As a part of this effort, we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage our business operations. We may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data. In the quarter ended October 31, 2002, following the first phase of our enterprise resource planning software implementation, we were still experiencing some difficulties in providing customer quotes and in acknowledging and shipping customer orders. Although we believe that we have identified, to a large extent, the problems associated with the implementation and that the system is now stabilizing, new problems could arise that we have not foreseen. During 2003, we expect to implement a new customer support information system and some additional functionality to our enterprise resource planning software. If further disruptions occur in the current implementation or the implementation of the additional system and functionality in 2003, our operations could be interrupted. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner: provide quotes, take customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business. As a result, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected. In addition, our future revenue and profit projections could be inaccurate if we have misjudged the realization of potential future savings from the new systems. 55 Table of Contents Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the senior convertible debentures. Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. Our quarterly sales and operating results have become highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Throughout 2002, the continued low levels of orders significantly affected our ability to efficiently plan production and inventory levels, which led to fluctuations in operating results. In addition, a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. If we cannot adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall, this may magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. Fluctuations in our operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the debentures. If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer. We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to: properly identify customer needs; innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications; successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time; differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings; price our products competitively; and anticipate our competitors development of new products, services or technological innovations. Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; 56 Table of Contents differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. The current U.S. and international response to terrorism could exacerbate these risks. For example, there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions such as Southeast Asia, where we have significant manufacturing operations. This could disrupt our ability to manufacture products or import parts as well as cause interruptions and or delays in our ability to transport products to our customers or parts to other locations to continue the manufacturing and assembly processes. Any such delay or interruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel. Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. Our decision to continue temporary pay cuts in 2002 and to eliminate pay increases for 2002 where legally permissible, along with the scaled down pay increase program for 2003, may harm our long term ability to retain and hire key personnel. Although the labor market has changed dramatically within the past two years, and our attrition rate has remained low, there is still intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit. Our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected. In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from the investment communitys expectations in a given quarter. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including: the retention of key employees; the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas; the retention of key customers; and the integration or coordination of different research and development, product manufacturing and sales programs and facilities. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to: effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser; identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. Any additional impairment of the value of purchased assets and goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers 57 Table of Contents also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted. If sales of custom integrated circuits to Hewlett Packard decline, our semiconductor products revenue will suffer, and we are limited in our ability to sell these integrated circuits to other companies. Historically, our semiconductor products business has sold custom products to Hewlett Packard and has engaged in product development efforts with divisions of Hewlett Packard. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, shipments from our semiconductor products group to Hewlett Packard accounted for approximately 8 percent of our total shipments and approximately 33 percent of our semiconductor products business shipments. We have a license agreement with Hewlett Packard that covers integrated circuit technology used in custom integrated circuits for Hewlett Packards printers, scanners and computers. The license agreement provides that, until November 2002 in some cases and until November 2009 in other cases, we are prohibited, with some exceptions, from using this integrated circuit technology for the development and sale of integrated circuits for use in inkjet products, printer products (including printer supplies, accessories and components), document scanners and computing products to third parties other than Hewlett Packard. Although we have entered into a supply agreement for the sale to Hewlett Packard of custom integrated circuits used in printers, scanners and computers, the agreement does not require Hewlett Packard to purchase a minimum amount of product from us. In the event that Hewlett Packard reduces its purchases of our custom integrated circuits, we would be unable to address this reduction through sales of these kinds of integrated circuits for these types of products to other customers. Environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future. Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by Hewlett Packard for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from Hewlett Packard. Hewlett Packard has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time consuming negotiations and litigation. In addition, Hewlett Packard will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While Hewlett Packard has agreed to minimize interference with on site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that Hewlett Packard will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations. We have agreed to indemnify Hewlett Packard for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from Hewlett Packard to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by Hewlett Packard. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination. 58 Table of Contents Our semiconductor and other manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. We may be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability. Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Our businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/ export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation of other agencies such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed. Some of our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the Toxic Substances Control Act. We must conform the manufacture, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and our failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. Our sales to U.S. government agencies and contractors are approximately 5 percent of our total sales. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative penalties. Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products. While we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our 59 Table of Contents technology, products or services. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. However, we may not be able to obtain license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products. We often rely on licenses of intellectual property useful for our businesses. We cannot ensure that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. In addition, our position with respect to the negotiation of licenses has changed as a result of our separation from Hewlett Packard. In the past, as a part of Hewlett Packard, we benefited from our access to Hewlett Packards entire intellectual property portfolio when asserting counterclaims and negotiating cross licenses with third parties. Our current patent cross license agreement with Hewlett Packard gives us only a limited right to sublicense a portion of Hewlett Packards intellectual property portfolio. Accordingly, we may be unable to obtain agreements on terms as favorable as we may have been able to obtain if we could have sublicensed Hewlett Packards entire intellectual property portfolio. Nothing restricts Hewlett Packard from competing with us other than some restrictions on the use of patents licensed to Hewlett Packard by us. Third parties may infringe our intellectual property, and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury. Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. Our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademark registrations. In addition, our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share. Furthermore, some intellectual property rights are licensed to other companies, allowing them to compete with us using that intellectual property. If we suffer loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Washington and Japan, are all located in areas with above average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. 60 Table of Contents If we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense, our net income and earnings per share would be significantly reduced. There has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options. Currently we record compensation expense only in connection with option grants that have an exercise price below fair market value. For option grants that have an exercise price at or in excess of fair market value we calculate compensation expense and disclose the impact on net (loss) earnings and net (loss) earnings per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements. It is possible that future laws and regulations will require us to record the fair market value of all stock options as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Note 14, Stock Based Compensation, of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this report reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on our net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share if it had been in effect during the past three years. If our operating results do not improve in the long term we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. We evaluate whether our deferred tax assets can be realized and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. A valuation allowance would be recorded if it were more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets would not be realized before they expire. If we establish a valuation allowance we might record a tax expense in our statement of operations which would have an adverse impact on our net income. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 75 percent of our revenues in 2002 and 70 percent of our revenues in each of fiscal years 2001 and 2000 were generated in U.S. dollars. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2002 and October 31, 2001, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 61 Table of Contents
