Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Form 10 K contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward looking statements can also be identified by words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "plans," "predicts," and similar terms. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Companys actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" below. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. All information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal calendar. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations requires the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes the following to be critical accounting policies. That is, they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (i.e., hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains 20 a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed and determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and volume based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company distributes its products through third party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia and by arranging with third party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customers financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write down for inventories of components and products, including third party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product lifecycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer industry is subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required 21 to record additional write downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded. The Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified. Valuation of Long Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangibles The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value. Although the Company has recognized no material impairment adjustments related to its property, plant, and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in the Companys business in a geographic region or business segment in the future, including deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores, could lead to such impairment adjustments in the future periods in which such business issues are identified. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill but instead performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires that: (1) goodwill be allocated to various reporting units of the Companys business to which it relates; (2) the Company estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which the goodwill relates; and (3) the Company determine the book value of those reporting units. If the estimated fair value of reporting units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their book value, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of those reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This requires independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets including in process research and development and developed technology. Once this process is complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be determined. Based on the Companys estimates as of September 27, 2003, there was no impairment of goodwill. However, changes in various circumstances including changes in the Companys market capitalization, changes in the Companys forecasts, and changes in the Companys internal business structure could cause one or more of the Companys reporting units to be valued differently thereby causing an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the personal computer industry and changes in global or regional economic conditions, the Company may strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring, disposing, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of property, plant, and equipment, identifiable intangibles, or goodwill. Warranty Costs The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical experience of failure rates. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts 22 as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Companys results of operations. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys results of operations and financial position. 23 Net Sales Net sales and Macintosh unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product follow (net sales in millions and Macintosh unit sales in thousands): 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Net Sales by Operating Segment: Americas net sales (a) $ 3,181 2 % $ 3,131 3 % $ 3,037 Europe net sales 1,309 5 % 1,251 0 % 1,249 Japan net sales 698 (2 )% 710 0 % 713 Retail net sales 621 119 % 283 19 Other segments net sales (a) 398 8 % 367 6 % 345 Total net sales $ 6,207 8 % $ 5,742 7 % $ 5,363 Unit Sales by Operating Segment: Americas Macintosh unit sales 1,620 (6 )% 1,728 (2 )% 1,768 Europe Macintosh unit sales 684 (5 )% 722 (4 )% 754 Japan Macintosh unit sales 339 (12 )% 386 (2 )% 394 Retail Macintosh unit sales 187 103 % 92 7 Other segments Macintosh unit sales (a) 182 5 % 173 5 % 164 Total Macintosh unit sales 3,012 (3 )% 3,101 0 % 3,087 Net Sales by Product: Power Macintosh net sales (b) $ 1,237 (10 )% $ 1,380 (17 )% $ 1,664 PowerBook net sales 1,299 56 % 831 2 % 813 iMac net sales 1,238 (15 )% 1,448 30 % 1,117 iBook net sales 717 (18 )% 875 8 % 809 Total Macintosh net sales 4,491 (1 )% 4,534 3 % 4,403 Peripherals and other hardware (c) 1,058 57 % 674 74 % 387 Software (d) 362 18 % 307 33 % 230 Service and other sales 296 30 % 227 (34 )% 343 Total net sales $ 6,207 8 % $ 5,742 7 % $ 5,363 Unit Sales by Product: Power Macintosh unit sales (b) 667 (13 )% 766 (18 )% 937 PowerBook unit sales 604 69 % 357 3 % 346 iMac unit sales 1,094 (16 )% 1,301 8 % 1,208 iBook unit sales 647 (4 )% 677 14 % 596 Total Macintosh unit sales 3,012 (3 )% 3,101 0 % 3,087 Net sales per Macintosh unit sold (e) $ 1,491 2 % $ 1,462 3 % $ 1,426 iPod unit sales 939 146 % 381 iPod net sales $ 345 141 % $ 143 Notes: (a)Other segments consists of Asia Pacific and FileMaker. Certain net sales in 2002 and 2001 related to recent acquisitions and Internet services have been reclassified from Other segments net sales to Americas segment net sales to conform to the 2003 presentation. 24 (b)Power Macintosh figures include server sales. (c)Net sales of peripherals and other hardware include sales of iPod, Apple branded and third party displays, and other hardware accessories. (d)Net sales of software include sales of Apple branded operating system and application software and sales of third party software. (e)Net sales per Macintosh unit sold is derived by dividing total Macintosh net sales by total Macintosh unit sales. Fiscal Year 2003 versus 2002 Net sales increased $465 million or 8% during 2003 compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined 3% year over year to approximately 3 million units in 2003. Several factors have contributed favorably to net sales during 2003 including: The Retail segments net sales grew to $621 million during 2003 from $283 million in 2002, an increase of 119%. While the Companys customers may elect to purchase product from their local Apple Retail store rather than through other preexisting sales channels in the United States, the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales is incremental to total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading "Segment Operating Performance." Net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose $384 million or 57% during 2003 compared 2002, which follows a $287 million or 74% increase in 2002 as compared to 2001. The current year increase was primarily driven by the $202 million, or 141%, year over year increase in iPod net sales to $345 million. All of the Companys operating segments experienced substantial increases in iPod net sales and unit sales during 2003. iPod sales during 2003 were favorably affected by the introduction of substantially redesigned new models, which are compatible with both Macintosh and Windows operating systems and by the Companys introduction of its iTunes Music Store for the Macintosh operating system in April 2003. The Companys iPod digital music player is sold by a variety of resellers, many of which do not currently market the Companys Macintosh systems. The Company has expanded this distribution network during 2003, which has contributed to the current year increase in iPod unit sales of 146%. In addition to the iPod, the increase in net sales of peripherals and other hardware during 2003 also reflects an overall increase in net sales of other computer accessories including AirPort cards and base stations, which facilitate wireless connectivity; third party digital cameras and printers; and a number of portable computer related accessories. Although total Macintosh unit sales were down 3% in 2003, unit sales of the Companys portable systems were relatively strong primarily due to the 69% or 247,000 unit increase in PowerBook unit sales, slightly offset by a 4% or 30,000 unit decrease in iBook unit sales. The increase in PowerBook net sales of $468 million or 56% is due primarily to the success of the Companys new 12 inch, 15 inch and 17 inch models that were introduced during 2003. The decline in iBook consumer portable sales during 2003 is primarily due to a lower average price per unit. Portable systems represented 42% of all Macintosh systems sold in 2003 versus 33% in 2002 and 31% in 2001, which reflects an overall industry trend towards portable systems. The Companys average net sales per Macintosh unit sold increased 2% to $1,491 in 2003 as a result of various changes in overall unit mix towards relatively higher priced PowerBook systems and an increase in direct sales primarily from the Companys retail and online stores, offset by somewhat lower year over year pricing on comparable Macintosh systems for most of the Companys Macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure, particularly with the Companys 25 iBook consumer portable systems. PowerBook and Power Macintosh systems accounted for 42% of total unit sales in 2003 versus 36% in 2002. Net sales of software increased $55 million or 18% during 2003 compared to the prior year and reflects higher net sales of Apple branded application and server software and third party software. Net sales of Apple branded application and server software increased due to the introduction of several new software titles during the year including Final Cut Express, iLife, and Keynote, as well as from higher sales of software related to recent acquisitions including PowerSchool and Emagic. Growth in net sales of third party software during 2003 was particularly strong in the Americas Segment due to strong sales of software by the Companys online store and its Retail segment. Service and other sales rose $69 million or 30% during 2003 and results from significant year over year increases in net sales associated with AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended maintenance and support services, as well as the Companys Internet related services. Increased net sales associated with APP are primarily the result of increasing attach rates over the last several years. Increased net sales associated with Internet services are due to net sales from the iTunes Music Store introduced in April 2003 and increased net sales of the Companys .Mac Internet service. Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net sales during 2003 were negatively impacted by the following factors: Total unit sales of desktop systems fell 15% during 2003 compared to 2002. iMac systems unit sales declined 16% from 2003 to 2002 resulting from a shift in sales away from desktop systems in favor of portables. Also, the current flat panel iMac form factor was in the eighth quarter of its life cycle by the end of 2003 and did not experience significant enhancements until the release of the 20 inch flat panel iMac in November 2003. Unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 13% during 2003 compared to 2002. For the first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002, unit sales of Power Macintosh systems decreased 24%, which is representative of the decline of Power Macintosh systems sales experienced by the Company during recent years and is also believed to be attributable to delays in purchasing pending the release of the Power Mac G5. As expected, this trend reversed in the fourth quarter of 2003 with unit sales increasing 26% during the quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year due largely to the new Power Mac G5, which the Company introduced in June 2003 and began shipping at the end of fiscal 2003. The decline in Power Macintosh sales over the last several years also reflects the shift in sales to portable systems, particularly PowerBooks. In addition, the Company continues to believe that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers. Additionally, some of the Companys professional and creative customers may have delayed upgrades of their systems in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented Macintosh software applications to run natively on Mac OS X. Currently there are many applications that run natively on Mac OS X, including Adobes PhotoShop 7 and QuarkXPress 6; however, there is no assurance that this will result in additional sales of Macintosh systems, particularly Power Macintosh units. The Company has continued to experience ongoing weakness in its U.S. education channel during 2003. Net sales and unit sales in U.S. education during 2003 were down 4% and 6%, respectively, as compared to 2002. This decline was due to a decrease in K 12 sales, partially offset by an increase in higher education sales. Net sales declined primarily as a result of a continued shift in mix away from higher priced Power Macintosh and iMac systems towards lower priced eMac and iBook systems, although the Company did experience a significant increase in sales of its PowerBook systems primarily to higher education customers. Portable systems accounted for approximately 43% of total unit sales in the education channel during 2003, as compared to approximately 34% in 2002. 26 The Companys one to one (1:1) learning solutions are a complete solution consisting of an iBook portable system for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server. The Company has experienced significant competition in 1:1 learning solutions and, accordingly, has experienced a lower sales price per unit, on average, in these transactions. The Company believes weakness in its U.S. education channel, particularly K 12, has been caused by multiple factors including funding pressures due to weak economic conditions, large budget deficits in many states, and increased competition particularly for desktop computers. Although the Company has taken steps, and will continue to take steps, to address weakness in the U.S. education channel, it remains difficult to anticipate when and if this negative trend will reverse. The personal computer industry in general, and the Company specifically, continue to see relatively soft demand for their products. Sales of professional and consumer oriented Macintosh systems remain far below levels experienced in fiscal 2000 and earlier. Difficult global economic conditions during the past several years exacerbated by the economic and political uncertainties caused by terrorist activities and the associated international responses have clearly had a pronounced negative effect on the overall demand for the Companys products in virtually all of its markets. Further, growth in the overall personal computer industry has slowed due to the high market penetration of personal computers and a lengthening of consumer, creative, and business personal computer upgrade cycles. Fiscal Year 2002 versus 2001 Net sales increased $379 million or 7% during 2002 compared to 2001, while Macintosh unit sales were relatively flat year over year at approximately 3.1 million units. On a geographic basis, performance in the domestic market was relatively strong, especially when considering the performance of the Companys Retail segment, which operated during 2002 exclusively in the United States. However, the European and Japanese markets remained sluggish throughout 2002. The Companys net sales in 2002 were positively influenced by a number of factors. First, net sales from software, service, peripherals, and other sources rose $248 million or 26% in 2002 versus 2001. This increase was driven by several factors including a 28% increase in combined third party and Apple branded software sales; $143 million in net sales of iPod, the Companys portable digital music player that was introduced in the first half of 2002; a 9% increase in the sale of computer accessories; and a 14% increase in service revenue caused primarily by increased revenue associated with extended maintenance and support contracts. The growth in software revenue was primarily the result of increased sales of third party software in the Companys retail and online stores and expansion in recent years in the number of Apple branded software titles. Second, overall unit sales of Macintosh portable systems grew by 92,000 units or 10% in 2002 reflecting a general trend in the personal computer market away from desktop systems towards portable systems. During 2002, portable Macintosh systems represented 33% of total systems sales versus 31% in 2001 and 20% in 2000. Growth in this area has been most pronounced for iBook, the Companys education and consumer oriented portable Macintosh system. iBook unit sales increased 14% in 2002 and 9% in 2001. Third, the Companys Retail segment grew from 8 stores at the end of 2001 to 40 stores at the end of 2002. The Retail segments net sales grew from $19 million in 2001 to $283 million in 2002. While the Retail segment may have cannibalized some net sales from the Companys preexisting sales channels in the U.S., the Company believed that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales was incremental to the Companys total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading "Segment Operating Performance." 27  Fourth, the Companys average unit pricing increased 3% during 2002 as a result of various changes in overall unit mix offset by somewhat lower pricing year over year on comparative Macintosh systems. Net sales per Macintosh unit sold during 2002 of $1,462 per unit reflected the shift in mix towards relatively higher priced portable Macintosh systems and reflected the impact on net sales of the relatively higher priced new iMac design introduced during 2002. The impact of these changes in mix were offset by the decline in unit sales of relatively higher priced Power Macintosh systems and by lower pricing on comparative Macintosh systems during 2002 for most of the Companys Macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure. Fifth, any comparison of net sales in 2002 versus 2001 must consider the effect of unusually low net sales during the first quarter of 2001. This was attributable to several factors at the beginning of 2001, including continued deterioration in worldwide demand for personal computers, rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the Company during that quarter that cost the Company approximately $138 million, and a plan implemented by the Company during the first quarter of 2001 that reduced substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels that resulted in a decline in channel inventory of approximately 300,000 units during that quarter. Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net sales in 2002 were negatively impacted by several notable factors. First, unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 18% during 2002 as compared to 2001. This followed a 35% decline in Power Macintosh unit sales in 2001 from 2000. The Company believed that weak economic conditions over the past several years had a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers and that many of these customers continued to delay upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the Companys ongoing transition to Mac OS X, its new operating system, and in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their Macintosh applications to run natively in Mac OS X. Further, the Company did not experience the anticipated increase in Power Macintosh sales that it expected following the introduction of Adobes PhotoShop 7 during 2002. Additionally, many professional users may have postponed upgrading their systems until after the introduction of Mac OS X Jaguar released in the fourth quarter of 2002. Others may have delayed upgrading until after the availability of other professionally oriented software applications for Mac OS X such as QuarkXPress. Second, despite the overall increase in net sales during 2002 in the Americas, the Company continued to see weakness in its U.S. education channel. Total net sales in this channel fell 15% in 2002 and 4% in 2001. These declines were consistent with industry data that showed the Company losing market share in the U.S. education market in each of the last two fiscal years. The Company believed this weakness was caused by multiple factors, including increased price competition in this price sensitive market from the Companys competitors who sell Windows based personal computers. Additionally, some of the Companys education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on their available funding. Third, the personal computer industry in general and the Company specifically experienced soft demand for its products due to adverse global economic conditions, political uncertainties, and a lengthening of consumer, creative, and business personal computer upgrade cycles. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the Companys Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan, except for the activities of the Companys Retail segment. The Retail segment currently operates 28 Apple owned retail stores in the United States and opened its first international store in Tokyo, Japan in the first quarter of 2004. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys operating segments may be found in Item 8 of this Form 10 K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, "Segment Information and Geographic Data." Americas Net sales in the Americas segment during 2003 increased $50 million or 2% compared to 2002. During 2003 and 2002, the Americas segment represented approximately 51% and 55%, respectively, of the Companys total net sales and represented approximately 54% and 56%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. The results of the Americas segment are similar to the overall results of the Company as they reflect substantially lower unit sales and net sales of Power Macintosh systems and iMac systems, partially offset by increases in unit sales and net sales of PowerBooks. The net sales of the Americas segment, and the Company in total, also reflect substantially higher sales of peripherals, software, and services during 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to higher sales of iPods and Internet services. The Americas segment has been negatively affected by weakness in its U.S. education channel. As noted above, total net sales and unit sales in the U.S. education channel during 2003 were down 4% and 6%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2002. The Company believes this decline is caused by increased competition in the education market and by a reduction in spending by U.S. educational institutions due to federal and state funding concerns and tax revenue shortfalls resulting from the weak economy. Additionally, some of the decline during 2003 in net sales and unit sales of Macintosh systems in the Americas segment may be the result of the operation of the Companys Retail segment whose net sales, all of which occurred within the U.S., increased significantly during 2003. Net sales for the Americas segment increased 3% or $94 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The Americas segment was negatively affected by a decline in U.S. education sales in 2002 of $215 million. The Americas segment also experienced a 17% decline in Power Macintosh unit sales. However, outside of the U.S. education channel, unit sales of consumer desktop and portable systems rebounded from the substantial declines experienced in 2001, rising a combined 31% in 2002. Sales of software, peripherals, and accessories were also up in the Americas during 2002. Growth in unit sales of consumer oriented systems during 2002 in the Americas is somewhat attributable to the significantly depressed level of net sales experienced in the first quarter of 2001 as discussed above. However, growth in the Americas was somewhat negatively affected, particularly with respect to consumer oriented systems, by the significant growth of the Companys Retail segment in the U.S. More than 70% of the Retail segments Macintosh unit sales during 2002 were for iMacs and iBooks. Europe Net sales in Europe increased $58 million or 5% during 2003 as compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined by 5% during the same period. Europes operating results were consistent with the trend experienced in the Americas and by the Company as a whole. Europe experienced weakened demand for Power Macintosh, iMac and iBook systems in 2003, partially offset by strong demand for PowerBooks whose net sales increased by 48% or $100 million from 2002. Europe also realized increased sales of peripherals, software, and service, primarily attributable to higher sales of iPods, accessories and APP. Economic conditions in Europe remained weak throughout 2002, and the overall demand for the Companys products in that region remained flat during 2002 versus 2001. Unit sales in Europe for 2002 reflect relatively stronger demand for consumer oriented products, particularly iBook whose unit sales increased 27% in 2002, offset by declines in Power Macintosh unit sales. Japan Net sales in Japan decreased $12 million or 2% during 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002, the weakest year to date performance of any of the Companys operating segments. Japans Macintosh unit 29 sales were particularly weak in 2003, declining 12%, and were primarily attributable to lower sales of iMac and iBook systems, partially offset by an increase in PowerBook sales as well as higher sales of peripherals and other hardware. Japans Macintosh unit sales remain significantly below the segments historic levels due to current economic conditions that remain particularly negative in Japan. Net sales in Japan remained flat during 2002 versus 2001, with a slight decline in unit sales of 2%. Consistent with the Companys other geographic operating segments, during 2002 Japan showed growth in unit sales of consumer systems and a decline in unit sales of Power Macintosh systems. Japans iMac unit sales increased 85% in 2002. However, in the case of Japan the increase in iMac unit shipments in 2002 versus 2001 was primarily the result of the unusually depressed level of net sales experienced by the Company in the first quarter of 2001 as discussed above. Additionally, net sales in Japan on a sequential and year over year comparative basis generally worsened as 2002 progressed reflecting particularly poor economic conditions in Japan. Retail The Company opened 25 new retail stores during 2003, bringing the total number of open stores to 65 as of September 27, 2003, which compares to 40 open stores as of September 28, 2002 and 8 open stores as of September 29, 2001. During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company opened 9 additional stores including its first international store in the Ginza in Tokyo, Japan. The Retail segments net sales grew to $621 million during 2003 from $283 million in 2002 and from $19 million in 2001. The $338 million or 119% increase in net sales during 2003 reflects the impact from opening 25 new stores in 2003, the full year impact of 2002 store openings, as well as an increase in average revenue per store. Total Macintosh sales increased by approximately $170 million of which $108 million related to year over year increases in PowerBook sales. The Retail segment has also contributed strongly to the increases in net sales of peripherals, software and services experienced by the Company during 2003. During 2003, approximately 45% of the Retail segments net sales came from the sale of Apple branded and third party peripherals, software and services as compared to 28% for the Company as a whole. With an average of 54 stores open during 2003, the Retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $11.5 million, as compared to approximately $10.2 million based on an average of 28 stores open in 2002. As measured by the Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail segment improved from a loss of $22 million during 2002 to a loss of $5 million during 2003. This improvement is primarily attributable to the segments year over year increase in net sales, which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation and other fixed costs. Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled approximately $290 million through the end of fiscal 2003, $92 million of which was incurred during 2003. As of September 27, 2003, the Retail segment had approximately 1,300 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $354 million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Investment in a new business model such as the Retail segment is inherently risky, particularly in light of the significant investment involved, the current economic climate, and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the Retail segments operating expenses. 30 Gross Margin Gross margin for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2003 are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): 2003 2002 2001 Net sales $ 6,207 $ 5,742 $ 5,363 Cost of sales 4,499 4,139 4,128 Gross margin $ 1,708 $ 1,603 $ 1,235 Gross margin percentage 27.5 % 27.9 % 23.0 % Gross margin decreased to 27.5% of net sales in 2003 from 27.9% of net sales in 2002. This decline in gross margin reflects relatively aggressive pricing actions on several Macintosh models instituted by the Company beginning in late fiscal 2002 as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry, lower sales of relatively higher margin Power Macintosh systems during the first three fiscal quarters of 2003, and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp up of the new Power Mac G5 and 15 inch PowerBook, both of which began shipping in volume during September 2003. This decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed. The aforementioned negative factors affecting gross margins during 2003 were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales. The Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2004 in light of weak economic conditions, price competition in the personal computer industry, and potential increases in component pricing. The Company also expects to continue to incur air freight charges on the Power Mac G5 and other products during 2004. The foregoing statements regarding the Companys expected gross margin during 2004, general demand for personal computers, anticipated industry component pricing, anticipated air freight charges, and future economic conditions are forward looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained, targeted gross margin levels will be achieved, or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Companys product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Companys ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Companys operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, the Companys results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Companys operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns. Gross margin increased to 27.9% of net sales in 2002 from 23.0% in 2001. Gross margin in 2001 was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of 2% experienced in the first quarter of 2001. As a 31 percentage of net sales, the Companys quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal 2002 from 31% in the first quarter down to 26% in the fourth quarter. This decline resulted from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the Company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal computer industry. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2003 are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): 2003 2002 2001 Research and development $ 471 $ 446 $ 430 Percentage of net sales 8 % 8 % 8 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 1,212 $ 1,109 $ 1,138 Percentage of net sales 20 % 19 % 21 % Restructuring costs $ 26 $ 30 Purchased in process research and development $ 1 $ 11 Research and Development (R&D) The Company recognizes that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Companys core business strategy. The Company has historically relied upon innovation to remain competitive. R&D expense amounted to approximately 8% of total net sales during 2003, 2002 and 2001, up substantially from approximately 5% of total net sales in fiscal year 2000 and recent earlier periods. The Companys management believes that maintaining or increasing the pace of innovation and product development is the best way to respond to current economic and market conditions and will continue to position the Company for future growth as conditions improve. R&D expense increased 6% or $25 million to $471 million in 2003 as compared to 2002, which follows a $16 million increase in 2002 as compared to 2001. The overall increase in R&D expense relates primarily to increased headcount and support for new product development activities. R&D spending also included capitalized software development costs of approximately $14.7 million related to the development of Mac OS X Panther in 2003; approximately $13.3 million associated with the development of Mac OS X Jaguar and approximately $6 million associated with the PowerSchool enterprise student information system in 2002; and approximately $5.4 million associated with the development of the original version of Mac OS X in 2001. Further information related to the Companys capitalization of software development costs may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A) SG&A increased $103 million or 9% during 2003 as compared to 2002 due primarily to the Companys continued expansion of the Retail segment and increases in headcount. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in current year discretionary spending on marketing and advertising and by savings resulting from the 2003 and 2002 restructuring activities described below. SG&A decreased $29 million or 3% during 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease in SG&A in 2002 was primarily the result of lower discretionary spending on marketing and advertising expenses, decreased spending related to information systems, and benefits directly related to the Companys restructuring actions in 2002 and 2001. The decreases were partially offset by higher sales expense in 2002 resulting from increased operating expenses associated with expansion of the Companys Retail segment. 32 Restructuring Actions During the second quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million. The primary focus of actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Companys Americas and Europe operating segments and further reductions associated with PowerSchool related activities in the Americas operating segment. The second quarter actions resulted in recognition of severance costs of $2.4 million for termination of 93 employees, 92 of whom were terminated prior to the end of 2003 at a cost of $2.2 million. During the second quarter of 2003, an additional $400,000 was accrued for asset write offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility in the Americas operating segment. The Company estimates these restructuring actions will reduce quarterly operating expenses by $1.5 million. During the first quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing operations at the Company owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These restructuring actions will ultimately result in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide, all but one was eliminated by the end of 2003. The Company estimates these restructuring actions will reduce quarterly operating expenses by $6 million. During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the Companys operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Companys Retail operating segment. The Company estimates these restructuring actions will result in reduced quarterly operating expenses of approximately $10 million. Of the $30 million restructuring charge for fiscal 2002, $6 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to actions designed to reduce headcount costs in corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. Headcount actions, primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development, resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of a PowerSchool product that resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the product in the amount of $4.5 million. The remaining charge in 2002 of $24 million was incurred in the first quarter of 2002 and resulted in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide, at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Companys operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Companys information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000. Purchased In Process Research and Development (IPR&D) During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH, a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for approximately $30 million in cash; $551,000 of which was allocated to IPR&D. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates primarily to Emagics Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43% 83% complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Companys fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts, which were completed in 2003, included finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined 33 using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. In May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc., a provider of web based student information systems for K 12 schools and districts that enables schools to record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real time, and gives parents real time web access to track their childrens progress. Of total purchase consideration of $66.1 million, $10.8 million was allocated to IPR&D and was expensed upon acquisition because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable web based student information system for use by K 12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the PowerSchool product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed during the Companys fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed during 2002, included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2003 are as follows (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Gains (losses) on non current investments, net $ 10 $ (42 ) $ 88 Unrealized loss on convertible securities $ $ $ (13 ) Interest income $ 69 $ 118 $ 218 Interest expense (8 ) (11 ) (16 ) Gains on sales of short term investments, net 21 7 Other income (expense), net (5 ) (2 ) 15 Gain on forward purchase agreement 6 Interest and other income, net $ 83 $ 112 $ 217 Total other income and expense $ 93 $ 70 $ 292 Gains and Losses on Non current Investments The Company has held investments in EarthLink Inc. (EarthLink), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM) and certain investments in private companies. These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have been categorized as available for sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other than temporary. The Company includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from other than temporary declines in fair value associated with these investments in other income and expense. Further information related to the Companys non current debt and equity investments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $9 million, and a gain before taxes of approximately $8 million. Additionally, the Company sold its remaining investment in ARM stock, 278,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a 34 gain before taxes of $270,000, and sold its remaining investment in EarthLink stock, 6,540,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $37 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million. The fair value of the Companys remaining investment in Akamai as of September 27, 2003, was approximately $5 million. During 2002, the Company determined that declines in the fair value of certain of these investments were other than temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in EarthLink, a $6 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in Akamai, and a $15 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in a private company investment. These losses in 2002 were partially offset by the sale of 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000, the sale of 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000, and the sale of approximately 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. During 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $39 million and recorded a gain before taxes of $36 million, and sold a total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $176 million and recorded a gain before taxes of $174 million. These gains during 2001 were partially offset by a $114 million charge to earnings that reflected an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the Companys investment in EarthLink and an $8 million charge that reflected an other than temporary decline in the fair value of certain private company investments. Unrealized Loss on Convertible Securities On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 required the Company to adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to earnings during the first quarter of 2001, the before tax effect of which was an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million. Interest and Other Income, Net Net interest and other income decreased $29 million or 26% to $83 million during 2003. The decrease is primarily the result of declining investment yields on the Companys cash and short term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short term investments fell to 1.89% in 2003 compared to 2.85% in 2002. The decrease is offset by the increase of $14 million from the gain on the sales of short term investments from the Companys fixed income portfolio, and the increase of $6 million from the gain on the forward purchase agreement during the fourth quarter of 2003. Net interest and other income was $112 million in fiscal 2002, compared to $217 million in fiscal 2001. This $105 million or 48% decrease was primarily the result of declining investment yields on the Companys cash and short term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short term investments fell to 2.85% in 2002 compared to 5.38% in 2001. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate for 2003 was 26% compared to the higher statutory rate due primarily to research and development credits, a non taxable gain on stock repurchase and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes were provided. As of September 27, 2003, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $452 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. As of September 27, 2003, a valuation allowance of $30 million was 35 recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates principally to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. On April 10, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed adjustments to the Companys federal income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2000, and the Company has made certain prepayments thereon. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years prior to 1998 have been resolved. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Cumulative Effects of Accounting Changes Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities certain freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment represented the mark to market adjustment to fair value for a forward purchase agreement that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at a price of $16.64 per share. The Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003. The settlement resulted in an additional gain of approximately $6 million, which is included in interest and other income, net. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative effect type adjustment to net income during 2003 of approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement been applied to the Companys existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred. Accounting for Derivatives The adoption of SFAS 133 during 2001 resulted in a favorable cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $12 million, net of a related income tax effect of approximately $5 million. Further information related to the adoption of SFAS Nos. 133, 143 and 150 and the resulting cumulative accounting effects may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation The Company currently measures compensation expense for its employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, 36 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and provides pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as further discussed in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Companys employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. The FASB decided on April 22, 2003 to require all companies to expense the value of employee stock options. Companies will be required to measure the cost of employee stock options according to their fair value. The FASB has indicated that it plans to issue in the first quarter of calendar year 2004 an exposure draft of a new accounting standard addressing this matter. Prior to issuance of this exposure draft, the FASB has indicated it will be addressing several significant technical issues. Among other things, the FASB must determine the extent to which the new accounting standard will permit adjustments to recognized expense for actual option forfeitures and actual performance outcomes. This determination will affect the timing and amount of compensation expense recognized. Also, a method to determine the fair value of employee stock options must be established. Current accounting standards require use of an option pricing model, such as the Black Scholes formula, to determine fair value and provide guidance on adjusting some of the input factors used in the model. This valuation approach has received significant criticism and may be subject to changes that could have a significant impact on the calculated fair value of employee stock options under the new standard. At the Companys annual shareholders meeting on April 24, 2003, shareholders approved a proposal requesting that the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) establish a policy of expensing the value of all future employee stock options issued by the Company. The Board and management appreciate and take seriously the views expressed by the Companys shareholders. As discussed in the Companys Form 10 Q for the period ended March 29, 2003, the Company had decided not to expense the value of employee stock options until the FASB finalizes its new accounting standard on the matter. The Company based this decision on the FASBs announced intention to soon require all companies to expense the value of employee stock options and the FASBs near term review of technical issues that will play a significant role in determining the fair value of and accounting for employee stock options. The Company monitors progress at the FASB and other developments with respect to the general issue of employee stock compensation. In the future, should the Company expense the value of employee stock options, either out of choice or due to new requirements issued by the FASB, the Company may have to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on the Companys future results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 and applied immediately to any variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an interest is obtained after that date. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2003. The adoption of the provision of FIN 46 related to variable interests created after January 31, 2003 did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. The Company continues to evaluate the provisions of FIN 46, and does not believe that the adoption of the remaining provisions will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 37  In May 2003, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No. 00 21 provides guidance on how to account for certain arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services, and or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00 21 apply to revenue transactions entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. Additionally, in August 2003, the EITF reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97 2, "Software Revenue Recognition," to Non Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More than Incidental Software. EITF Issue No. 03 5 provides guidance on determining whether non software deliverables are included within the scope of SOP 97 2, and accordingly, whether multiple element arrangements are to be accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00 21 or SOP 97 2. The Company currently applies the requirements of SOP No. 97 2 when accounting for all multiple element transactions. The Company does not anticipate the application of either EITF Issue Nos. 00 21 or 03 5 will have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ 4,566 $ 4,337 $ 4,336 Accounts receivable, net $ 766 $ 565 $ 466 Inventory $ 56 $ 45 $ 11 Working capital $ 3,530 $ 3,730 $ 3,625 Days sales in accounts receivable (DSO) (a) 41 36 29 Days of supply in inventory (b) 4 4 1 Days payables outstanding (DPO) (c) 82 77 73 Annual operating cash flow $ 289 $ 89 $ 185 (a)DSO is based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period. (b)Days supply of inventory is based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period. (c)DPO is based on ending accounts payable and most recent quarterly cost of sales adjusted for the change in inventory. As of September 27, 2003, the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments portfolio totaled $4.566 billion, an increase of $229 million from the end of fiscal 2002. The Companys short term investment portfolio consists primarily of investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Companys investments are generally liquid and investment grade. As a result of declining investment yields on the Companys cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates during 2003, the Company has elected to reduce the average maturity of its portfolio to maintain liquidity for future investment opportunities when market interest rates increase. Accordingly, during 2003 the Company increased its holdings in short term investment grade instruments, both in U.S. corporate and foreign securities, that are classified as cash equivalents and has reduced its holdings in longer term U.S. corporate securities classified as short term investments. Although the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments increased in 2003, the Companys working capital at September 27, 2003 decreased by $200 million as compared to the end of 38 fiscal 2002 due primarily to the current year reclassification of the Companys long term debt as a current obligation resulting from its scheduled maturity in February 2004. The primary sources of total cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2003 were $289 million in cash generated by operating activities and $53 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by $164 million utilized for capital expenditures and $26 million for the repurchase of common stock. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt obligations, stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. Debt The Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994. The notes, which pay interest semiannually, were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes, along with approximately $4 million of unamortized deferred gains on closed interest rate swaps, are due in February 2004 and therefore have been classified as current debt as of September 27, 2003. The Company currently anticipates utilizing its existing cash balances to settle these notes when due. Capital Expenditures The Companys total capital expenditures were $164 million during fiscal 2003, $92 million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment related to the Companys Retail segment and $72 million of which were primarily for corporate infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $160 million for capital expenditures during 2004, approximately $85 million of which is expected to be utilized for further expansion of the Companys Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure. Stock Repurchase Plan In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Companys common stock had a fair value of $22.81. Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was still authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 27, 2003. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. 39 Lease Commitments As of September 27, 2003, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $600 million, $354 million of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on the Companys existing operating leases range from 1 to 12 years. Subsequent to September 27, 2003, the Company entered into additional operating lease commitments for retail space with future lease commitments totaling $64 million for periods ranging from 10 to 12 years. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 1 to 3 months. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. As of September 27, 2003, the Company had outstanding third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately $848 million. Indemnifications The Company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights. Other licensing agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. General economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the Companys products and the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. The Companys operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions. For much of the past several years, demand for the Companys products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some of the Companys education customers appear to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on their available funding. Continued uncertainty about future economic conditions continues to make it difficult to forecast future operating results. Should global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, demand for the Companys products could continue to be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. War, terrorism or public health issues could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products which could negatively affect the Companys operations and performance. War, terrorism or public health issues, whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could continue to cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties 40 that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Companys suppliers or customers. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events could result in a decrease in demand for the Companys products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to its customers, or to receive components from its suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply chain. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these events. The Company and some of its manufacturing vendors and component suppliers have significant operations in various locations throughout Asia, including locations in mainland China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Singapore, all of which were subject to the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) travel advisories at times during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2003. Similar travel advisories were issued for Taiwan, where a significant amount of the Companys portable Macintosh systems and the iPod are assembled. Should the severity of the SARs threat increase or other public health issues arise, the Company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The market for personal computers and related peripherals and services is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected. The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense. The Companys competitors who sell Windows based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or maintain market share in response to the weakness in demand that began in the second half of calendar 2000 for personal computing products. The Companys results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. The personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Companys existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Companys key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the Companys competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music products that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Companys products. The Company has a significant number of competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Companys markets. The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing Microsofts Windows operating systems. The Companys future operating results and financial condition 41 are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms, including Windows. The Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices including iPods. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music distribution services, free peer to peer music services, emerging companies, and larger companies that may have greater resources, including technical and marketing resources, and supplier relationships. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets. Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Companys operating results and financial position. The Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors. The Companys ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the Companys Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Companys brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure. The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions in order to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand. Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the Companys existing products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance; the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, including production ramp issues; the availability of application software for new products; the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand; the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. During 2001, the Company introduced a new client operating system, Mac OS X, and delivered its first major upgrade, Mac OS X version 10.1. Other major upgrades include Mac OS X Jaguar in 2002 and most recently Mac OS X Panther in October 2003. Inability of the Company to provide additional improvements in the performance and functionality of Mac OS X, advance customer acceptance of the new operating system and its upgrades, obtain the continued commitment of software developers to transition existing applications to run on Mac OS X, or create new applications to run on Mac OS X, may have an adverse impact on the Companys operating results and financial condition. Because orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk. The Company records a write down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its 42 inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns. Future operating results are dependent upon the Companys ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources. Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, TFT LCD flat panel displays, and optical and magnetic disk drives), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Companys requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Companys ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC based microprocessor for the Companys Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Companys competitors by Intel Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using other operating systems. Further, despite its efforts to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in recent years where the inability of the Companys suppliers to provide advanced PowerPC G4 and G3 microprocessors with higher clock speeds in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Companys results of operations. In addition, currently IBM is the Companys sole supplier of the G5 processor used in current Power Macintosh products and Motorola is the sole supplier of the G4 processors. The inability in the future of the Company to obtain microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could have an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. 43 The Company relies on third party music content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with third parties to offer their music content to customers through the Companys iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this third party music. Many of the Companys licensing arrangements with these third party content providers are short term in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Certain parties in the music industry have announced their intent to consolidate their music distribution operations, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer music content to customers through the iTunes Music Store. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of music content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or expand its geographic reach outside the United States, then sales and gross margins of the Companys iTunes Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals, including iPods, may be adversely affected. Third party content providers and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms. If the requirements from content providers or artists change, then the Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse affect on the Companys operating results and financial position. The Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the United States. Many of the Companys products are manufactured in whole or in part by third party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Companys future operating results and financial condition. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Companys manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, and Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the Peoples Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Companys products and final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third party vendors in Japan, Taiwan and China. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic, business, environmental, medical, political, or military conditions or events, the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Companys products, from time to time, experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits. The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain "bugs" that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties that may be beyond its control. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant expense to remedy. 44 The Companys retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Through November 2003, the Company has opened 74 retail stores including its first international store in Tokyo, Japan. The Companys retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 15 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segments costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason. Certain of the Companys stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Companys more typical retail stores. The Company has opened four such stores and has one under construction. Because of their location and size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from $25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Many of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Companys control, that could adversely affect the Retail segments future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and or have an adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among other things, macro economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; lack of consumer acceptance of the Companys retail approach; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the United States; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple branded and third party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost. Unit sales of the Companys professionally oriented desktop systems have declined sharply over the past several years negatively impacting net sales and gross margin. Unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 13% during 2003 as compared to 2002 and fell 18% in 2002 from 2001. Power Macintosh unit sales have fallen as a percentage of total Macintosh unit sales from 30% in 2001 to 22% in 2003. The Company believes that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are the primary users of such systems. Also, it is likely that many of the Companys current and potential customers, particularly professional and creative customers who are most likely to utilize the Companys Power Macintosh systems, believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance. In addition to the negative impact on net sales, declining sales of Power Macintosh systems also have a negative effect on the Companys overall gross margin because Power Macintosh systems generally have higher individual gross margins than the Companys other Macintosh systems. Continued deterioration in Power Macintosh unit sales could adversely affect the Companys future net sales and gross margin. If future unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fail to 45 partially or fully recover, it will be difficult for the Company to improve its overall profitability. While the Company has introduced faster Power Macintosh systems utilizing 64 bit PowerPC G5 processors during 2003, there can be no assurance that introduction of such systems will favorably impact net sales either in the short or long term. The Company faces increasing competition in the U.S. education market. Sales in the United States to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college and university customers, remain a core market for Apple. Net sales in these markets fell to 18% of the Companys total net sales in 2003 from 21% and 26% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The drop in 2003 reflects declines in both net sales and Macintosh unit sales in these markets of 4% and 6%, respectively, in fiscal 2003 compared to 2002. Additionally, several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers, which could also negatively affect the Companys market share. In an effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and will continue to pursue 1:1 learning solutions in education. These 1:1 solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Companys operating results and financial condition. The Companys future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Companys products. The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores around the world. The Company also sells its own products and certain third party products through its retail stores. Many of the Companys significant resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by current economic conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weaken, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Companys products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees. These programs could require a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment. Over the past several years, an increasing proportion of the Companys net sales have been made by the Company directly to end users through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the United States. Some of the Companys resellers have perceived this expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their own business and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the Companys products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Companys resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Companys products. The Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Companys products. Further information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10 K under the heading "Markets and Distribution," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. 46 The Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations. A large portion of the Companys revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Companys operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Companys products and the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components, negatively affecting the Companys results of operations. Margins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions, and interest rate swap and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further information related to the Companys global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10 K under the subheading "Foreign Currency Risk" and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. The Companys future performance is dependent upon support from third party software developers. If third party software applications cease to be developed or available for the Companys hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Companys products. The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Companys personal computers, as opposed to Windows based systems, are often based on the availability of third party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third party application software for the Companys hardware products depends in part on third party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Companys products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Companys financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the Companys decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Companys prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Companys operating system, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Companys products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence 47 the decision of third party software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh compatible software products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop based database management, and high quality presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application. In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August 2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsofts interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsofts perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system. Discontinuance of Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products for the Macintosh platform would have an adverse effect on the Companys net sales and results of operations. In June of 2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of Internet Explorer for the Mac OS. Microsofts decision to discontinue development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X appears to have been influenced in part by the Companys introduction during 2003 of its own web browser, Safari. It is unclear what impact, if any, Microsofts decision to cease further development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X will have on the Company. However, if customers chose not to purchase the Companys products because Internet Explorer is not available on the Macintosh platform or should websites fail to provide support for web browsers other than Internet Explorer, the Companys net sales and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The Companys business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Companys future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third party, the Companys future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in 48 Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10 K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10 K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons. The Companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. As a result, the overall profitability of the Company in any given period will depend, in part, on the product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that periods net sales. The typical concentration of net sales in the third month of the Companys fiscal quarters can adversely affect the Companys business and operating results. The Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Companys internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Companys ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower than anticipated demand for the Companys products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Companys key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition. The Companys success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Companys employees are located. The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Potential accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options may impair the Companys future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel. The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance. The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost and or availability, the Company does not have insurance coverage. For these reasons, the Company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost. Business interruptions could adversely affect the Companys future operating results. The Companys major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, medical conditions, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake related losses. The Companys operating results and financial 49 condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster. Failure of the Companys information technology systems and breaches in the security of data could adversely affect the Companys future operating results. Information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Companys ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns by its implementation of sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened as economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has non trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non trade receivables, there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors. The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations. Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member countries, Japan and California. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operation and financial position. Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the Companys future operating results. Financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies, including the FASB and the SEC, who interpret and create appropriate accounting regulations. A change from current accounting regulations can have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations and could impact the manner in which the Company conducts business. Unanticipated changes in the Companys tax rates could affect its future results. The Companys future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes 50 resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition. The Companys stock price may be volatile. The Companys stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of positive performance in the Companys stock price, as well as general economic and political conditions and investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Companys stock in the future. The Companys acquisition activity could disrupt its ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transaction. The Company has acquired and may continue to acquire companies that have products, services, personnel and technologies that complement the Companys strategic direction and product roadmap. These acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties in incorporating the acquired companies operations and technologies; distraction of managements attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with acquisition; and unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence process, including product quality issues and legal contingencies. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that the Companys previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect business, operating results or financial condition. The Company has generally paid cash for its acquisitions. Should the Company issue its common stock or other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted. 51  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Companys foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the non hedge portfolios, the Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys operating results and financial position. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 as of October 1, 2000. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. Management does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Companys hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income. Interest Rate Risk While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries, the Companys interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. The Companys fixed income investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Companys investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process. During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio and debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments. The Company places its short term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short term investments. As of September 27, 2003, approximately $629 million of the Companys short term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 and 5 years. As of September 28, 2002, $1.087 billion of the Companys investment portfolio classified as short term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. Due to liquidity needs, or in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for the purpose of duration management of the Companys investment portfolio, the Company may sell investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such activity, the Company recognized net gains of $21 million in 2003 and $7 million in 2002. 52 In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 27, 2003, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $12.9 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 28, 2002, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $37.7 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Companys policy is to hold investments to maturity. The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Companys floating rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short term investments with its fixed rate interest expense on its debt, and or to diversify a portion of the Companys exposure away from fluctuations in short term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company entered into no interest rate asset swaps during 2003 or 2002 and had no open interest rate asset swaps at September 27, 2003. In prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions. The interest rate debt swaps, which qualified as accounting hedges, generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three or six month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Companys fixed rate 10 year debt to floating rate debt and convert a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions realizing a gain of $6 million. During 2001 the Company closed out all of its then existing debt swap positions realizing a gain of $17 million. Both the gains in 2002 and 2001 were deferred, recognized in long term debt and are being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt. Foreign Currency Risk Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, generally benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries. In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Companys foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Companys foreign 53 exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of $7.5 million as of September 27, 2003 compared to a maximum one day loss of $3.8 million as of September 28, 2002. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual gains and losses in the future associated with the Companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 27, 2003 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Companys actual exposures and positions. 54
