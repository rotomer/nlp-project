Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Form 10 K contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward looking statements can also be identified by words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "plans," "predicts," and similar terms. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Companys actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" below. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. All information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal calendar. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Executive Overview Apple designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals and networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops and markets a line of portable digital music 23 players along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third party music and audio books. The Companys products and services include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the iPod digital music player, the Xserve server and Xserve RAID storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, the online iTunes Music Store, a portfolio of peripherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod product lines, and a variety of other service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force, and third party wholesalers, resellers and value added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third party Macintosh compatible products, including computer printers and printing supplies, storage devices, computer memory, digital video and still cameras, personal digital assistants, and various other computing products and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business and government customers. A further description of the Companys products may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this document under the heading "Business." The Companys business strategy leverages its unique ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers around the world compelling new products and solutions with superior ease of use, seamless integration and innovative industrial design. The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Macintosh line of computers, consumer electronics with its iPod line of digital music players and distribution of third party digital music through its online iTunes Music Store. While the Company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal computer market as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital music, these are highly competitive markets that are subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition. In order to remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development (R&D) is necessary in order to maintain and extend its position in the markets where it competes. The Companys R&D spending is focused on delivering timely updates and enhancements to its existing line of personal computers, displays, operating systems, software applications and portable music players; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas such as rack mount servers, RAID storage systems, and wireless technologies. The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Macintosh computers, and demonstrate the seamless compatibility of the Macintosh with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes that providing a high quality sales and after sales support experience is critical to attracting and retaining customers. To ensure a high quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company has expanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 86 stores open as of September 25, 2004. The Company has also staffed selected third party stores with the Companys own employees to improve the buying experience through reseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees in reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Japan and Australia. The Company also sells to customers direct through one of its online stores around the world. To improve the accessibility of its iPod product line, the Company has significantly expanded the number of distribution points where iPods are sold. The iPod product line can now be purchased in department stores, discount stores and specialty music and audio visual stores. 24 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations require the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and exposures related to inventory purchase commitments, valuation of long lived assets including acquired intangibles, warranty costs, and income taxes. Management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (i.e., hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and volume based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations. 25 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company distributes its products through third party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia and by arranging with third party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customers financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write down for inventories of components and products, including third party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer industry is subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded. The Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified. Valuation of Long Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangibles The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of 26 the assets exceeds their fair market value. Although the Company has recognized no material impairment adjustments related to its property, plant, and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in the Companys business in a geographic region or business segment in the future, including deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores, could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods in which such business issues are identified. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires that: (1) goodwill be allocated to various reporting units of the Companys business to which it relates; (2) the Company estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which the goodwill relates; and (3) the Company determine the book value of those reporting units. If the estimated fair value of reporting units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their book value, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of those reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This requires independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets including in process research and development and developed technology. Once this process is complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be determined. Based on the Companys estimates as of September 25, 2004 there was no impairment of goodwill. However, changes in various circumstances including changes in the Companys market capitalization, changes in the Companys forecasts, and changes in the Companys internal business structure could cause one or more of the Companys reporting units to be valued differently thereby causing an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the personal computer industry and changes in global or regional economic conditions, the Company may strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring, disposing, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of property, plant, and equipment, identifiable intangibles, or goodwill. Warranty Costs The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Companys results of operations. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax 27 liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys results of operations and financial position.

(g)Net sales per Macintosh unit sold is derived by dividing total Macintosh net sales by total Macintosh unit sales. Fiscal Year 2004 versus 2003 During fiscal 2004, net sales increased 33% or $2.1 billion from fiscal 2003. Several factors have contributed favorably to net sales during 2004: Net sales of Macintosh systems increased $432 million or 10% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 while net sales per Macintosh unit sold remained relatively flat on a year over year basis. Unit sales of Macintosh systems increased 278,000 units or 9% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. These increases in net sales and unit sales were a result of strong demand for all of the Companys Macintosh systems, except for the iMac. The Companys portable systems, consisting of the PowerBook and iBook, produced the strongest revenue and unit growth during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 of approximately 26% and 33%, respectively. Unit sales of portable systems accounted for 51% of all Macintosh systems sold during fiscal 2004 compared to only 42% during 2003. The Company believes that these results reflect an overall trend in the industry towards portable systems. Performance of the Companys Power Macintosh systems also yielded positive results in fiscal 2004, including a 15% and 6% increase in net sales and unit sales, respectively. The increase in year to date Power Macintosh sales is due primarily to the introduction of the Power Mac G5, which began shipping at the end of fiscal 2003. Although Power Macintosh sales have increased from the prior year, sales of this product were constrained in the second half of 2004 as a result of manufacturing problems at IBM, the Companys sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor. Net sales of iPods rose $961 million or 279% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales of iPods totaled 4.4 million in fiscal 2004, which represents an increase of 370% from the 939,000 iPod units sold in fiscal 2003. Strong demand for the iPods during fiscal 2004 continued to be 29 experienced in all of the Companys operating segments and was driven by enhancements to the iPod, the introduction of the iPod mini, increased expansion of the Companys iPod distribution network, and continued success of the iTunes Music Store due largely to making it available to both Macintosh and Windows users in the U.S., U.K., France and Germany. Since inception of the iPod product line in fiscal 2002, the Company has sold approximately 5.7 million iPods. The Retail segments net sales grew 91% to $1.2 billion during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. This increase is largely attributable to the increase in total stores from 65 at the end of 2003 to 86 at the end of 2004, as well as a 36% year over year increase in average revenue per store. While the Companys customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may elect to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Companys preexisting sales channels in the U.S. and Japan, the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales is incremental to the Companys total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading "Segment Operating Performance." Net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 38% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer accessories. Net sales of other computer accessories include AirPort cards and base stations, iSight digital video cameras, and third party hardware products. The increase in total net sales of peripherals and other hardware is related to the overall increase in Macintosh unit sales and the introduction of new and updated peripheral products and was experienced predominantly by the Companys Americas, Europe, and Retail segments. Other music products consists of sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod related services and accessories. Net sales of other music products increased $242 million or 672% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. The Company has experienced strong growth in sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall iPod unit sales for fiscal 2004. The increased sales from the iTunes Music Store, which was originally introduced in April 2003, is primarily due to making the store available for Windows in October 2003 and the introduction of the store in the U.K., France, and Germany in June 2004. Net sales of software rose $140 million or 39% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to higher net sales of the Companys Apple branded software and in particular, higher net sales of the Companys operating system software, Mac OS X version 10.3 "Panther," which was released in October 2003. Net sales of Panther accounted for approximately $74 million or over 50% of the increase in software net sales for fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. The Companys U.S. education channel experienced year over year growth in net sales of approximately 19% for fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales also increased by 10% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in U.S. education net sales for fiscal 2004 relates primarily to a 40% year over year increase in higher education net sales and to a lesser extent the Companys 3% growth in K 12 net sales. The Company believes the U.S. K 12 education market remains challenging due to multiple factors including funding pressures due to weak economic conditions, large budget deficits in many states, and increased competition particularly for desktop computers. Although the Company has taken steps, and will continue to take steps, to address weakness in the U.S. education channel, it remains difficult to anticipate when and if this trend will reverse. Service and other sales increased $37 million or 13% during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. These increases are the result of significant year over year increases in net sales associated with AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended maintenance and support services, as well as increases in net sales associated with the Companys .Mac Internet service. Increased net sales associated with APP are primarily the result of higher Macintosh unit sales and higher attach rates on APP over the last several years. 30  Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net sales during fiscal 2004 were negatively impacted by the following: Net sales and unit sales of iMac systems were down 23% and 16%, respectively, during fiscal 2004 versus 2003. The decrease in iMac net sales and unit sales was largely due to the delay in the introduction of the new iMac, based on the PowerPC G5 processor, primarily as a result of manufacturing problems experienced by IBM. The delays in the new iMac resulted in the depletion of inventory of the old iMac flat panel prior to availability of the new iMac G5. The old flat panel iMac form factor which was available during most of fiscal 2004, was nearly 3 years old by the time the new iMac G5 began shipping in September 2004 and had experienced declines in sales as a result of the age of this product. The Company believes that sales of iMac systems have also declined due to a shift in consumer preference to portable systems and competitor desktop models with price points below $1,000. The Company introduced a new version of the eMac in April 2004 with a suggested retail price starting at $799 aimed at the price sensitive customer. Net sales and unit sales in the Companys Japan segment decreased 3% and 14%, respectively, during fiscal 2004 versus 2003. The Company believes these declines relate to a shift in sales from the Japan Segment to the Retail segment as a result of the Tokyo and Osaka store openings in fiscal 2004. Declines in Japan may also relate to delays in computer upgrades by certain professional and creative customers pending release in Japan of certain Mac OS X native applications, such as Quark Xpress 6, which did not become available until September 2004. When sales from the Japan retail stores are included in the results for the Japan segment, the combined revenue in Japan resulted in a 3% year over year increase in fiscal 2004 as compared to 2003. See additional comments below related to the Japan segment under the heading "Segment Operating Performance." Fiscal Year 2003 versus 2002 Net sales increased $465 million or 8% during 2003 compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined 3% year over year to approximately 3 million units in 2003. Several factors contributed favorably to net sales during 2003 including: The Retail segments net sales grew to $621 million during 2003 from $283 million in 2002, an increase of 119%. While the Companys customers may have elected to purchase product from their local Apple Retail store rather than through other preexisting sales channels in the U.S., the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales was incremental to total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading "Segment Operating Performance." Net sales of iPods rose $202 million or 141% during 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was experienced by all of the Companys operating segments. iPod sales during 2003 were favorably affected by the introduction of substantially redesigned new models, which were compatible with both Macintosh and Windows operating systems. The Companys iPod digital music player is sold by a variety of resellers, many of which do not currently market the Companys Macintosh systems. The Company expanded this distribution network during 2003, which contributed to the 2003 increase in iPod unit sales of 146%. The Company also experienced an increase in net sales of peripherals and other hardware totaling $164 million or 31% during 2003 compared to 2002, reflecting an overall increase in net sales of other computer accessories including AirPort cards and base stations, which facilitate wireless connectivity; third party digital cameras and printers; and a number of portable computer related accessories. Net sales of other music products, including sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod related services and accessories, increased $32 million or 800% during 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was due primarily to the introduction of the iTunes Music Store for the Macintosh 31 operating system in April 2003 and higher sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in iPod net sales and unit sales during 2003. Although total Macintosh unit sales were down 3% in 2003, unit sales of the Companys portable systems were relatively strong primarily due to the 69% or 247,000 unit increase in PowerBook unit sales, slightly offset by a 4% or 30,000 unit decrease in iBook unit sales. The increase in PowerBook net sales of $468 million or 56% was due primarily to the success of the Companys new 12 inch, 15 inch and 17 inch models that were introduced during 2003. The decline in iBook consumer portable sales during 2003 was primarily due to a lower average price per unit. Portable systems represented 42% of all Macintosh systems sold in 2003 versus 33% in 2002, which reflected an overall industry trend towards portable systems. The Companys average net sales per Macintosh unit sold increased 2% to $1,491 in 2003 as a result of various changes in overall unit mix towards relatively higher priced PowerBook systems and increases direct sales primarily from the Companys retail and online stores, offset by somewhat lower year over year pricing on comparable Macintosh systems for most of the Companys Macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure, particularly with the Companys iBook consumer portable systems. PowerBook and Power Macintosh systems accounted for 42% of total unit sales in 2003 versus 36% in 2002. Net sales of software increased $55 million or 18% during 2003 compared to the prior year and reflected higher net sales of Apple branded application and server software and third party software. Net sales of Apple branded application and server software increased due to the introduction of several new software titles during fiscal 2003 including Final Cut Express, iLife, and Keynote, as well as from higher sales of software related to recent acquisitions including PowerSchool and Emagic. Growth in net sales of third party software during 2003 was particularly strong in the Americas Segment due to strong sales of software by the Companys online store and its Retail segment. Service and other sales rose $55 million or 24% during 2003 which primarily resulted from significant year over year increases in net sales associated with APP extended maintenance and support services, as well as the Companys Internet related services. Increased net sales associated with APP were primarily the result of increasing attach rates over the last several years. Increased net sales associated with Internet services were due to increased net sales of the Companys .Mac Internet service. Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net sales during 2003 were negatively impacted by the following factors: Total unit sales of desktop systems fell 15% during 2003 compared to 2002. iMac systems unit sales declined 16% from 2003 to 2002 resulting from a shift in sales away from desktop systems in favor of portables. Also, the flat panel iMac form factor available during fiscal 2003 was in the eighth quarter of its life cycle by the end of 2003. Unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 13% during 2003 compared to 2002. For the first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002, unit sales of Power Macintosh systems decreased 24%, which was representative of the decline of Power Macintosh systems sales experienced by the Company during recent years and was also believed to be attributable to delays in purchasing pending the release of the Power Mac G5. As expected, this trend reversed in the fourth quarter of 2003 with unit sales increasing 26% during the quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year due largely to the new Power Mac G5, which the Company introduced in June 2003 and began shipping at the end of fiscal 2003. The decline in Power Macintosh sales over the previous several years also reflects the shift in sales to portable systems, particularly PowerBooks. In addition, the Company believes that weak economic conditions over the past 32 several years had a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers. Additionally, some of the Companys professional and creative customers may have delayed upgrades of their systems in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented Macintosh software applications to run natively on Mac OS X. The Company experienced ongoing weakness in its U.S. education channel during 2003. Net sales and unit sales in U.S. education during 2003 were down 4% and 6%, respectively, as compared to 2002. This decline was due to a decrease in K 12 sales, partially offset by an increase in higher education sales. Net sales declined primarily as a result of a continued shift in mix away from higher priced Power Macintosh and iMac systems towards lower priced eMac and iBook systems, although the Company did experience a significant increase in sales of its PowerBook systems primarily to higher education customers. Portable systems accounted for approximately 43% of total unit sales in the education channel during 2003, as compared to approximately 34% in 2002. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the Companys Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan and excludes revenue from the Companys own retail stores in Japan, which is included in the Companys Retail segment. The Retail segment operated Apple owned retail stores in the U.S. and Japan during fiscal 2004. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys operating segments may be found in Item 8 of this Form 10 K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, "Segment Information and Geographic Data." Americas During fiscal 2004, net sales in the Americas segment grew 26% or $838 million compared to fiscal 2003. The increase in net sales during 2004 was primarily attributable to the significant year over year increase in iPod sales as well as strong sales of peripherals, software, and services. This increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the Retail segment, which had 84 stores in the U.S. as of the end of fiscal 2004. Macintosh unit sales also increased by 4% in fiscal 2004 compared to 2003, driven primarily by strong sales of portable and Power Macintosh systems, partially offset by continued weakness in iMac sales. During 2004 and 2003, the Americas segment represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of the Companys total net sales and represented approximately 51% and 54%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. As noted above, the Company experienced an increase in U.S. education channel net sales of 19% for fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Strong U.S. education net sales for the current year relate primarily to strength in higher education net sales that resulted from a successful back to school selling season with strong demand for the Companys portables. This strength drove year over year growth in net sales of 40% for the higher education channel during fiscal 2004. The Companys K 12 net sales grew year over year by 3% during fiscal 2004, despite the challenges in the K 12 market from continued budget constraints and increased competition, due to the Companys continued focus and success with delivering 1:1 education solutions. Net sales in the Americas segment during 2003 increased $50 million or 2% compared to 2002. During 2003 and 2002, the Americas segment represented approximately 51% and 55%, respectively, of the Companys total net sales and represented approximately 54% and 56%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. The results of the Americas segment are similar to the overall results of the Company as they reflect substantially lower unit sales and net sales of Power Macintosh systems and iMac systems, partially offset by increases in unit sales and net sales of PowerBooks. The net sales of the Americas segment, and the Company in total, also reflect substantially higher sales of iPods, peripherals, software, and services during 2003 compared to 2002. The Americas segment had been negatively affected by weakness in its U.S. education channel during 2003. Total net sales and unit sales in the U.S. education channel during 2003 33 were down 4% and 6%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2002. The Company believes this decline was caused by increased competition in the education market and by a reduction in spending by U.S. educational institutions due to federal and state funding concerns and tax revenue shortfalls resulting from the weak economy. Additionally, some of the decline during 2003 in net sales and unit sales of Macintosh systems in the Americas segment may be the result of the operation of the Companys Retail segment whose net sales, all of which occurred within the U.S., increased significantly during 2003. Europe Net sales in Europe rebounded in fiscal 2004 increasing $490 million or 37% from 2003. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing 13% in fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net sales across all product lines, except for the iMac systems. Demand in Europe during fiscal 2004 was particularly strong for the Companys Power Macintosh systems and portable Macintosh systems, which experienced year over year increases of 29% and 42%, respectively. Similar to the results of the Companys other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and software were strong in fiscal 2004. Net sales in Europe increased $58 million or 5% during 2003 as compared to 2002 while Macintosh unit sales declined by 5% during the same period. Europes operating results were consistent with the trend experienced in the Americas and by the Company as a whole. Europe experienced weakened demand for Power Macintosh, iMac and iBook systems in 2003, partially offset by strong demand for PowerBooks whose net sales increased by 48% or $100 million from 2002. Europe also realized increased sales of iPods, peripherals, software, and services. Japan The Japan segment continues to be a challenge for the Company, with four consecutive years of year over year declines in both net sales and Macintosh unit sales. Japans net sales and unit sales were down 3% and 14%, respectively during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003, continuing to lag behind all of the Companys other operating segments. These decreases in net sales and unit sales are believed to be attributable in part to a shift in sales from the Japan segment to the Retail segment as a result of the opening of two stores in Japan in fiscal 2004. In addition, such decreases may have been related to delayed computer system upgrades by some professional and creative customers who were awaiting the release of Quark XPress 6 for Mac OS X, which did not occur until September 2004. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by strong iPod and iBook sales during fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Net sales in Japan decreased $12 million or 2% during 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002, the weakest year to date performance of any of the Companys operating segments. Japans Macintosh unit sales were particularly weak in 2003, declining 12%, and were primarily attributable to lower sales of iMac and iBook systems, partially offset by an increase in PowerBook sales as well as higher sales of iPods, and peripherals and other hardware. Japans Macintosh unit sales remained significantly below the segments historic levels due to economic conditions that remained particularly negative in Japan. Retail The Company opened 21 new retail stores during 2004, including its first two international stores in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, bringing the total number of open stores to 86 as of September 25, 2004. This compares to 65 open stores as of September 27, 2003 and 40 open stores as of September 28, 2002. During the first quarter of 2005, the Company anticipates opening approximately 14 additional stores to end the calendar year at approximately 100 stores. Approximately half of the stores expected to open during the first quarter of 2005 will be in the new "mini" store design, which is the Companys smallest store format to date; allowing it to be placed in a variety of new locations to introduce the Companys innovative products to even more customers. The Company also opened its third international store in London, England during the first quarter of 2005. 34 Net sales of the Retail segment grew to $1.185 billion during 2004 from $621 million and $283 million, in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increases in net sales during both 2004 and 2003 reflect the impact of new store openings for each fiscal year, including the opening of 21 new stores in 2004 and 25 new stores in 2003. An increase in average revenue per store also contributed to the segments strong sales in fiscal 2004. With an average of 76 stores open during 2004, the Retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $15.6 million, as compared to $11.5 million in 2003 with a 54 store average and $10.2 million in 2002 with a 28 store average. As measured by the Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported profit of $39 million during fiscal 2004 as compared to losses of $5 million and $22 million during 2003 and 2002, respectively. This improvement is primarily attributable to the segments year over year increase in average quarterly revenue per store, the impact of opening new stores, and the segments year over year increase in net sales, which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation and other fixed costs. Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment were $104 million in fiscal 2004, bringing the total capital expenditures since inception of the Retail segment to approximately $394 million. As of September 25, 2004, the Retail segment had approximately 2,100 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately $436 million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Gross Margin Gross margin for the three fiscal years ended September 25, 2004 are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $ 8,279 $ 6,207 $ 5,742 Cost of sales 6,020 4,499 4,139 Gross margin $ 2,259 $ 1,708 $ 1,603 Gross margin percentage 27.3 % 27.5 % 27.9 % Gross margin declined in fiscal 2004 to 27.3% of net sales from 27.5% of net sales in 2003. The Companys gross margin during fiscal 2004 declined due to an increase in mix towards lower margin iPod and iBook sales, pricing actions on certain Power Macintosh G5 models that were transitioned during the beginning of 2004, higher warranty costs on certain portable Macintosh products, and higher freight and duty costs during fiscal 2004. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by an increase in direct sales and a 39% year over year increase in higher margin software sales. The Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer and consumer electronics industries will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2005 in light of price competition, especially for the iPod product line. The Company also expects to continue to incur air freight charges, which negatively impact gross margins on the iMac and other products during the first quarter of 2005 and possibly beyond. The foregoing statements regarding the Companys expected gross margin during 2005, general demand for personal computers, anticipated air freight charges, and future economic conditions are forward looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained or targeted gross margin levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products, including iPods, will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide 35 global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Companys product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Companys ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Companys operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, the Companys results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Companys operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns. Gross margin decreased to 27.5% of net sales in 2003 from 27.9% of net sales in 2002. This decline in gross margin reflects relatively aggressive pricing actions on several Macintosh models instituted by the Company beginning in late fiscal 2002 as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry, lower sales of relatively higher margin Power Macintosh systems during the first three fiscal quarters of 2003, and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp up of the new Power Mac G5 and 15 inch PowerBook, both of which began shipping in volume during September 2003. This decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed. The aforementioned negative factors affecting gross margins during 2003 were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three fiscal years ended September 25, 2004 are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): 2004 2003 2002 Research and development $ 489 $ 471 $ 446 Percentage of net sales 6 % 8 % 8 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 1,421 $ 1,212 $ 1,109 Percentage of net sales 17 % 20 % 19 % Restructuring costs $ 23 $ 26 $ 30 Purchased in process research and development $ 1 Research and Development (R&D) The Company recognizes that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Companys core business strategy. The Company has historically relied upon innovation to remain competitive. R&D expense amounted to approximately 6% of total net sales during fiscal 2004 down from 8% of total net sales in both 2003 and 2002. This decrease is due to the significant increase of 33% in total net sales of the Company for fiscal 2004. Although R&D expense decreased as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal 2004, actual expenditures for R&D in fiscal 2004 increased $18 million or 4% from fiscal 2003, which follows a 6% or $25 million increase in 2003 compared to 2002. The overall increase in R&D expense relates primarily to increased headcount and support for new product development activities and the impact of employee salary merit increases in 2004. R&D spending also included capitalized software development costs of approximately $4.5 million related to the 36 development of Mac OS X Tiger and $2.3 million related to the development of FileMaker Pro 7 in 2004; $14.7 million related to the development of Mac OS X Panther in 2003; and approximately $13.3 million associated with the development of Mac OS X Jaguar and approximately $6 million associated with the PowerSchool enterprise student information system in 2002. Further information related to the Companys capitalization of software development costs may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A) Expenditures for SG&A increased $209 million or 17% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases are due primarily to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, an increase in amortization costs associated with restricted stock compensation, and higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary merit increases. SG&A as a percentage of total net sales in 2004 was 17%, down from 20% in 2003. This decrease is due to the increase of 33% in total net sales of the Company for fiscal 2004, reflecting leverage on the Companys fixed costs. SG&A increased $103 million or 9% during 2003 as compared to 2002 due primarily to the Companys continued expansion of the Retail segment and increases in headcount. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in 2003 discretionary spending on marketing and advertising and by savings resulting from the 2003 and 2002 restructuring activities described below. Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Actions The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23 million during the year ended September 25, 2004, including approximately $14 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and a $3.5 million charge for lease cancellations. Of the $23 million charge, $14.3 million had been spent by the end of 2004, with the remaining $8.7 million consisting of $5.2 million for employee severance benefits and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $5.5 million. In conjunction with the European workforce reduction during the second quarter of 2004, the Company vacated a leased sales facility during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting in a charge of $3.7 million for contract termination and asset impairment costs. The Company also recognized employee termination costs of $1.8 million related to the elimination of non essential positions, principally in Europe. In addition, the Company reversed $400,000 of excess restructuring expense from prior periods related primarily to lower than expected disposal costs on Sacramento manufacturing related fixed assets. The net cost of the restructuring plans for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $5.1 million, of which $300,000 had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 54 positions, 4 of which had been terminated prior to the end of 2004. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company finalized restructuring plans related to closing Company owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento. In addition, the Companys management approved restructuring plans related to certain headcount reductions primarily for various sales and marketing activities principally in the U.S. Total cost of the restructuring plan for the third quarter of 2004 was $7.9 million, of which $7.2 million had been paid prior to the end of 2004. These actions will result in the termination of 83 positions, 77 of which had been terminated prior to the end of 2004. The closing of manufacturing operations in Sacramento resulted in the elimination of 67 positions for a severance cost of $1.9 million and write off of $5.3 million in manufacturing related fixed assets whose use ceased during the third quarter of 2004. Termination of sales and marketing activities, principally in the U.S., resulted in severance of $0.7 million for the elimination of 16 positions. During the second quarter of 2004, the Companys management approved restructuring plans related to the termination of Company owned manufacturing activities in Sacramento and headcount reductions 37 related primarily to various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. Total cost of the actions was $9.6 million for the termination of 348 positions. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2004, $6.8 million had been spent and 310 positions had been eliminated related to these actions. The Company estimates the closing of the Sacramento manufacturing operations will result in reduced ongoing quarterly operating expenses of approximately $2 million. In addition, the Company estimates that the remaining restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2004 will ultimately result in reduced ongoing quarterly operating expenses of approximately $6 million. Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately $7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations. Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been spent by the end of 2004, except for approximately $3.0 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a property sooner than originally estimated and an approximately $500,000 shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected severance costs related to the closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported operating expense. During the second quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including $2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset write offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Companys Americas and Europe operating segments and further reductions associated with PowerSchool related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the termination of 93 employees. During the first quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of manufacturing operations at the Company owned facility in Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various sales and marketing activities in the U.S. and Europe. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide. Closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write off manufacturing related fixed assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation that arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the Company in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and marketing activities and employees, principally in the U.S. and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities of $6.7 million. The total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused restructuring accrual originally made during the first quarter of 2002. Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Actions During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the Companys operating expenses with 38 existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Companys Retail operating segment. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount costs in corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million, all of which were eliminated by September 27, 2003. Eliminated positions were primarily in corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development in the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchools PSE product. This shift resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million. During the first quarter of 2002, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Companys operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Companys information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. The Company ceased using the assets associated with first quarter 2002 restructuring actions during that same quarter. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. The first quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity not allocated to operating segments. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000. Purchased In Process Research and Development (IPR&D) During 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH, a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for approximately $30 million in cash; $551,000 of which was allocated to IPR&D. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for the three fiscal years ended September 25, 2004 are as follows (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Gains (losses) on non current investments, net $ 4 $ 10 $ (42 ) Interest income $ 64 $ 69 $ 118 Interest expense (3 ) (8 ) (11 ) Gains on sales of short term investments, net 1 21 7 Other income (expense), net (9 ) (5 ) (2 ) Gain on forward purchase agreement 6 Interest and other income, net $ 53 $ 83 $ 112 Total other income and expense $ 57 $ 93 $ 70 39 Gains and Losses on Non current Investments Over the course of the last three years, the Company has held investments that were classified as available for sale in EarthLink Inc. (EarthLink), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), ARM Holdings plc (ARM) and certain investments in private companies. Further information related to the Companys non current debt and equity investments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2004, the Company sold its remaining 986,000 shares of Akamai stock. The transaction generated proceeds of approximately $5 million and a gain before taxes of approximately $4 million. As of September 25, 2004, the Company does not have any non current public company investments reflected in its consolidated balance sheet. During 2003, the Company sold 1,875,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of approximately $9 million, and a gain before taxes of approximately $8 million. Additionally, the Company sold its remaining investment in ARM stock, 278,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of $270,000, and sold its remaining investment in EarthLink stock, 6,540,000 shares, for net proceeds of approximately $37 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million. During 2002, the Company determined that declines in the fair value of certain investments were other than temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in EarthLink, a $6 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in Akamai, and a $15 million charge to earnings to writedown the basis of its investment in a private company investment. These losses in 2002 were partially offset by the sale of 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000, the sale of 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000, and the sale of approximately 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. Interest and Other Income, Net Total interest and other income, net decreased $30 million or 36% to $53 million during fiscal 2004 compared to $83 million in 2003 and $112 million in 2002. These decreases are attributable primarily to declining investment yields on the Companys cash and short term investments resulting from lower market interest and a shortening of the average maturity of the Companys investment portfolio, as well as lower gains on sales of short term investments in fiscal 2004. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short term investments fell to 1.38% in 2004 compared to the 1.89% and 2.85% rates earned during 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company occasionally sells short term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains of $1 million, $21 million and $7 million during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in total interest and other income, net during fiscal 2003 was also offset by the $6 million gain related to the forward purchase agreement during the fourth quarter of 2003 which is further discussed below under the heading "Cumulative Effects of Accounting Changes." Interest expense consisted primarily of interest on the Companys $300 million aggregate principal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004, partially offset by amortization of deferred gains realized in 2002 and 2001 that resulted from the closure of swap positions associated with the unsecured notes. The unsecured notes were sold at 99.925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting from the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized as of the notes maturity in February 2004. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate for the year ended September 25, 2004 was approximately 28%. The Companys effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to 40 be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $647 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Companys balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. As of September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates principally to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for all years prior to 2001 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Cumulative Effects of Accounting Changes Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities certain freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003, which resulted in a favorable cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $3 million. This adjustment represented the mark to market adjustment to fair value for a forward purchase agreement that allowed the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock at a price of $16.64 per share. The Company settled this forward purchase agreement in August 2003. The settlement resulted in an additional gain of approximately $6 million, which is included in interest and other income, net. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable cumulative effect type adjustment to net income during 2003 of approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement been applied to the Companys existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which supercedes SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104 clarifies existing guidance regarding revenue contracts that contain multiple deliverables to make it consistent with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 00 21. The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. 41 In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 46R, a revision to FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46R clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements. FIN 46R is effective at the end of the first interim period ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. EITF 03 1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03 1 1, which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03 1 to investments in securities that are impaired; however, the disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2004. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of EITF 03 1, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation The Company currently measures compensation expense for its employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and provides pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as further discussed in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Companys employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. On March 31, 2004, the FASB issued a proposed Statement, Share Based Payment, that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The proposed Statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25 and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method. If adopted, it is currently anticipated that the proposed Statement would be effective for the Company beginning in its fourth fiscal quarter of 2005. At the Companys annual shareholders meeting on April 24, 2003, shareholders approved a proposal requesting that the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) establish a policy of expensing the value of all future employee stock options issued by the Company. The Board and management appreciate and take seriously the views expressed by the Companys shareholders. The Company decided not to expense the value of employee stock options until the FASB finalizes its new accounting standard on the matter, which may play a significant role in determining the fair value of and accounting for employee stock options. The Company monitors progress at the FASB and other developments with respect to the general issue of employee stock compensation. The Company is currently reviewing the potential impact from the guidance of the proposed statement, which may require the Company to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on the Companys future results of operations. The accounting impact had the Company chosen to apply the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, instead of the recognition provisions under APB Opinion No. 25, is described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ 5,464 $ 4,566 $ 4,337 Accounts receivable, net $ 774 $ 766 $ 565 Inventory $ 101 $ 56 $ 45 Working capital $ 4,375 $ 3,530 $ 3,730 Days sales in accounts receivable (DSO) (a) 30 41 36 Days of supply in inventory (b) 5 4 4 Days payables outstanding (DPO) (c) 76 82 77 Annual operating cash flow $ 934 $ 289 $ 89 (a)DSO is based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period. (b)Days supply of inventory is based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period. (c)DPO is based on ending accounts payable and most recent quarterly cost of sales adjusted for the change in inventory. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had $5.464 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments, an increase of $898 million over the same balances at the end of fiscal 2003. The principal components of this increase were cash generated by operating activities of $934 million and proceeds of $427 million from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, partially offset by cash used to repay the Companys outstanding debt of $300 million and purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $176 million. The Companys short term investment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid investments. Approximately $3.2 billion of this cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments are held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the one time favorable foreign dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and may decide to repatriate earnings from some of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. Debt In February 2004, the Company retired $300 million of debt outstanding in the form of 6.5% unsecured notes. The notes were originally issued in 1994 and were sold at 99.9925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The Company currently has no long term debt obligations. Capital Expenditures The Companys total capital expenditures were $176 million during fiscal 2004, $104 million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment related to the Companys Retail segment and $72 million of which were primarily for corporate infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $240 million for capital expenditures during 2005, approximately $125 million of which is expected to be utilized for further expansion of the Companys Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure. 43  Stock Repurchase Plan In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. In August 2003, the Company settled this agreement prior to its maturity, at which time the Companys common stock had a fair value of $22.81. Other than this forward purchase transaction, the Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal 2000. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was still authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 25, 2004. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 25, 2004 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Companys balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions): TOTAL Payments Due in Less Than 1 year Payments Due in 1 3 years Payments Due in 4 5 years Payments Due in More Than 5 years Operating Leases $ 617 $ 89 $ 170 $ 126 $ 232 Purchase Obligations 1,112 1,112 Asset Retirement Obligations 12 1 2 9 Other Obligations 24 14 10 Total $ 1,765 $ 1,215 $ 181 $ 128 $ 241 Lease Commitments As of September 25, 2004, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $617 million, $436 million of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on the Companys existing operating leases range from 2 to 16 years. Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The nature of the Companys outstanding third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments has not changed significantly since the end of its fiscal 2003. As of September 25, 2004, the Company had 44 outstanding third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately $1.1 billion. Asset Retirement Obligations The Companys asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September 25, 2004, the Company estimates that gross expected future cash flows of approximately $12 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. Other Obligations The Companys other obligations of approximately $24 million are primarily related to telecommunications services. Indemnifications The Company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse affect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. General economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the Companys products and the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. The Companys operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. Over the past several years, demand for the Companys products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some of the Companys education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy and state budget deficits on their available funding. Although recent macroeconomic trends seem to indicate an economic recovery, continued uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the Companys products and related operating results. Should global and or regional economic conditions deteriorate, demand for the Companys products could be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. War, terrorism, public health issues or other business interruptions could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products, which could negatively affect the Companys operations and performance. War, terrorism, public health issues and other business interruptions whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could continue to cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Companys suppliers or customers. The Companys major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, medical conditions, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near 45 major seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake related losses, the Companys operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events could result in a decrease in demand for the Companys products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to its customers or to receive components from its suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply chain. In addition, should major public health issues, including epidemics, arise the Company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these events. The market for personal computers and related peripherals and services, as well as digital music devices and related services, is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected. The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense. The Companys competitors who sell Windows and Linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or maintain market share in response to the weakness in demand that began in the second half of calendar 2000 for personal computing products. The Companys results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. The personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Companys existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Companys key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the Companys competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music products and or online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Companys products. The Company has a significant number of competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Companys markets. The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing other competing operating systems, including Windows and Linux. The Companys future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms. 46 The Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices, including iPods. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products and distribution services and free peer to peer music services. These competitors include both new entrants with novel market approaches, such as subscription services models, and also larger companies that may have greater technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than those of the Company, as well as established hardware, software and music content supplier relationships. Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Companys operating results and financial position. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully distribute and sell digital music outside the U.S. The Company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering prices and or increasing features which could adversely affect the Companys music product gross margins as well as overall Company gross margins. The Company also faces increased competition in the U.S. education market. Sales in the U.S. to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college and university customers, remain a core market for the Company. Uncertainty in this channel remains as several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers, which could negatively affect the Companys market share. In an effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and will continue to pursue one to one (1:1) learning solutions in education. The Companys 1:1 learning solutions are a complete solution consisting of an iBook portable system for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server. These 1:1 learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Companys operating results and financial condition. The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions in order to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, which are characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the Companys existing products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance; the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, including production ramp issues; the availability of application software for new products; the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand; the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. The Companys products, from time to time, experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits. The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain "bugs" that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. 47 Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to remedy. Because orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk. The Company records a write down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns. Future operating results are dependent upon the Companys ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, including microprocessors, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources. Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, and TFT LCD flat panel displays), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Companys requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Companys ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (formerly the Semiconductor Products Segment of Motorola, Inc.), the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC based microprocessor for the Companys Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Companys competitors by Intel Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using other operating systems. Further, despite its efforts to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz 48 rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in recent years where the inability of the Companys suppliers to provide advanced PowerPC microprocessors in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Companys results of operations. In addition, IBM is currently the Companys sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor, which is used in the Companys current Power Mac, Xserve, and iMac products. Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. is the sole supplier of the G4 processor, which is used in the Companys eMac and portable products. IBM has recently experienced manufacturing problems with the PowerPC G5 processor, which resulted in the Company delaying the shipment of various products and constrained certain product shipments during the second half of 2004. The inability of IBM to remedy these problems in a timely manner, avoid manufacturing problems in the future, and to deliver to the Company microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could further constrain shipments of products containing the G5 processor and could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S. Most of the Companys products are manufactured in whole or in part by third party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations, they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured or services rendered, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Companys future operating results and financial condition. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is currently conducted in the Companys manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the Peoples Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Companys products and final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third party vendors in Taiwan and China. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by events such as regional economic, business, environmental, medical, political, information technology system failures, or military actions, the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Companys future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Companys products. The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail stores. Many of the Companys significant resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by recent economic conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weaken, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Companys products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products caused resellers to 49 reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees. These programs could require a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment. Over the past several years, an increasing proportion of the Companys net sales have been made by the Company directly to end users through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the U.S. and Japan. Some of the Companys resellers have perceived this expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their own business and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the Companys products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Companys resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Companys products. The Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Companys products. Further information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10 K under the heading "Markets and Distribution." The Company relies on third party music content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with third parties to offer their music content to customers through the Companys iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this third party music. Many of the Companys licensing arrangements with these third party content providers are short term in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Certain parties in the music industry have announced their intent to consolidate their music distribution operations, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer music content to customers through the iTunes Music Store. Further, some third party content providers currently, or may in the future, offer music products and services that compete with the Companys music products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their music content in the future. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of music content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach outside the U.S., then sales and gross margins of the Companys iTunes Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals, including iPods, may be adversely affected. Third party content providers and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms. If the requirements from content providers or artists change, then the Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results and financial position. The Companys future performance is dependent upon support from third party software developers. If third party software applications cease to be developed or available for the Companys hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Companys products. The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Companys personal computers, as opposed to Windows based systems, are often based on the availability of third party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third party application software for the Companys hardware products depends in part on third party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Companys products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such 50 software products. To the extent the Companys financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the Companys decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Companys prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Companys operating system, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Companys products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence the decisions of third party software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh compatible software products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop based database management, and high quality presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application. In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August 2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft has not been obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsofts interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsofts perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system and competing digital media applications, including music distribution service and technology. In June of 2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of Internet Explorer for the Mac OS, subsequent to the Companys introduction during 2003 of its own web browser, Safari. Further discontinuance of products for the Macintosh platform, including Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products could have an adverse effect on the Companys net sales and results of operations. The Companys business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Companys future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms. Because of technological changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual 51 property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third party, the Companys future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10 K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10 K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Companys retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Through September 2004, the Company has opened 86 retail stores. The Companys retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 16 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segments costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason. Certain of the Companys stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Companys more typical retail stores. The Company has opened seven such stores through November 2004. Because of their location and size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 16 years with total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from $25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Many of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Companys control, that could adversely affect the Retail segments future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and or have an adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among other things, macro economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; lack of consumer acceptance of the Companys retail approach; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience 52 in managing retail operations outside the U.S.; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple branded and third party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Companys ongoing business and may present risks not originally contemplated. The Company may decide to invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the Companys strategic direction and product roadmap. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of managements attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy; and unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence process. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the Companys business, operating results or financial condition. Declines in the sales of the Companys professional products or increases in sales of consumer products, including iPods, may negatively impact the Companys gross margin and operating margin percentages Unit sales of the Companys professional products, including Power Macintosh and PowerBook systems, generally have higher gross margins than the Companys consumer products, including iMacs, iBooks, iPods, and content from the iTunes Music Store. A shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the Companys future gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Companys traditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products, specifically the iMac G5 and iBook, instead of professional products. Professional users may choose to buy the iMac G5 due to its relative price performance, use of the same PowerPC G5 processor used in the Companys Power Macs, and unique design featuring a flat panel screen. Potential PowerBook customers may also choose to purchase iBooks instead due to their price performance and screen size. Additionally, significant future growth in iPod sales without corresponding growth in higher margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Company believes that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are significant users of its professional systems. Also, it is likely that many of the Companys current and potential professional, creative, and small business customers, who are most likely to utilize professional systems, believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the Company utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other computer manufacturers and translates to slower overall system performance. These factors may result in an adverse impact to sales of the Companys professional products as well as to gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons. The Companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Companys direct sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have higher associated profitability than its indirect sales. Additionally, the Companys direct channels have traditionally had more sales of software and higher priced hardware products, which generally have higher gross margins, than through its indirect channels. As a result, the Companys gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix. In addition, the Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Companys internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Companys ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower than anticipated demand for the Companys products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Companys key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition. 53 The Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors. The Companys ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the Companys Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Companys brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non trade receivables, there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors. The Companys success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Companys key employees are located. The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Potential accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options may impair the Companys future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel. The Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance. The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional commercial insurance. Such conditions have and may continue to result in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, lower coverage limits and may also yield possible policy form exclusions. For some risks, because of cost and or availability, the Company does not have insurance coverage. Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial position. Failure of information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon which the Company relies could adversely affect the Companys future operating results. Information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Companys ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer 54 orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns for its own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the Company or a third party vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. The Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations. A large portion of the Companys revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Companys operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Companys products and the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components, negatively affecting the Companys results of operations. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. Further information related to the Companys global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10 K under the subheading "Foreign Currency Risk" and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations. Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse affect on the Company. Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the Companys future operating results. Financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies, including the FASB and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who interpret and create appropriate accounting regulations. A change from current accounting regulations, including accounting for stock based compensation, could have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations and could impact the manner in which the Company conducts business. 55 Unanticipated changes in the Companys tax rates could affect its future results. The Companys future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the Companys operating results and financial condition. The Companys stock price may be volatile. The Companys stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of positive performance in the Companys stock price, as well as general economic and political conditions and investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Companys stock in the future. In addition, increases in the Companys stock price may result in greater dilution of earnings per share. 56  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate swap and option positions, both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys operating results and financial position. Interest Rate Risk While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries, the Companys interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. The Companys short term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of current credit and interest rate trends. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Companys investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio. The Company places its short term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short term investments. As of September 25, 2004, approximately $180 million of the Companys short term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of September 27, 2003, $629 million of the Companys investment portfolio classified as short term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities, due to liquidity needs, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. As a result of such activity, the Company recognized net gains of $1 million in 2004, $21 million in 2003, and $7 million in 2002. In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 25, 2004, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $14.4 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 27, 2003, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $12.9 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Companys policy is to hold investments to maturity. From time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the Companys floating rate interest income on its cash equivalents 57 and short term investments with its fixed rate interest expense on its debt, and or to diversify a portion of the Companys exposure away from fluctuations in short term U.S. interest rates. The Company did not enter into any interest rate derivatives during 2004 or 2003 and had no open interest rate derivatives at September 25, 2004. In prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions. The interest rate debt swaps required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three or six month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Companys fixed rate 10 year debt to floating rate debt. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2001 and 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out interest rate debt swap positions realizing gains of $23 million. The gains were deferred, recognized in long term debt and were amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt. Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Companys foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Companys foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of $3.2 million as of September 25, 2004 compared to a maximum one day loss of $7.5 million as of September 27, 2003. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual gains and losses in the future associated with the Companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 25, 2004 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Companys actual exposures and positions. 58
