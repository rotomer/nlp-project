Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Form 10 K contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward looking statements can also be identified by words such as anticipates, expects, believes, plans, predicts, and similar terms. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Companys actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition below. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. All information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal 26 calendar. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Executive Overview The Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable digital music players along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third party music, audio books, music videos, short films, and television shows. The Companys products and services include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the iPod digital music player, the Xserve G5 server and Xserve RAID storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, the iTunes Music Store, a portfolio of peripherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod product lines, and a variety of other service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force, and third party wholesalers, resellers, and value added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third party Macintosh compatible products, including computer printers and printing supplies, storage devices, computer memory, digital camcorders and still cameras, personal digital assistants, and various other computing products and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business, and government customers. A further description of the Companys products may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this document under the heading Business. The Companys business strategy leverages its ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers around the world compelling new products and solutions with superior ease of use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Macintosh line of computers, consumer electronics with its iPod line of digital music players, and distribution of third party digital content through its online iTunes Music Store. While the Company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal computer and consumer electronic markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these are all highly competitive markets that are subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development (R&D) and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain and extend its position in the markets where it competes. The Companys R&D spending is focused on delivering timely updates and enhancements to its existing line of personal computers, displays, operating systems, software applications, and portable music players; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas such as rack mount servers, RAID storage systems, and wireless technologies. The Company also believes investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness. In June 2005, the Company announced its plan to begin using Intel microprocessors in its Macintosh computers. The Company plans to begin shipping certain models with Intel microprocessors by June 2006 and to complete the transition of all of its Macintosh computers to Intel microprocessors by the end of calendar year 2007. There are potential risks and uncertainties that may occur during this transition, which are further discussed under the heading Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition. The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Macintosh computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Macintosh with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes that providing a 27 high quality sales and after sales support experience is critical to attracting and retaining customers. To ensure a high quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company has expanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 124 stores open as of September 24, 2005. The Company also staffs selected third party stores with the Companys own employees to improve the buying experience through reseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees and contractors in reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world. To improve access to the iPod product line, the Company has significantly expanded the number of distribution points where iPods are sold. The iPod product line can be purchased in certain department stores, member only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels listed above. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations require the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, and income taxes. Management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. 28 The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and volume based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to the relevant program. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company distributes its products through third party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, and Asia and by arranging with third party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customers financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write down for inventories of components and products, including third party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer and consumer electronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded. 29 The Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified. Warranty Costs The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Companys results of operations. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The Company is currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which, if implemented by the Company, would affect the Companys tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys results of operations and financial position. 30 Net Sales Net sales and Macintosh unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product follow (net sales in millions and unit sales in thousands): September 24, 2005 Change September 25, 2004 Change September 27, 2003 Net Sales by Operating Segment: Americas net sales $ 6,590 64 % $ 4,019 26 % $ 3,181 Europe net sales 3,073 71 % 1,799 37 % 1,309 Japan net sales 920 36 % 677 (3 )% 698 Retail net sales 2,350 98 % 1,185 91 % 621 Other Segments net sales (a) 998 67 % 599 51 % 398 Total net sales $ 13,931 68 % $ 8,279 33 % $ 6,207 Unit Sales by Operating Segment: Americas Macintosh unit sales 2,184 30 % 1,682 4 % 1,620 Europe Macintosh unit sales 1,138 47 % 773 13 % 684 Japan Macintosh unit sales 313 8 % 291 (14 )% 339 Retail Macintosh unit sales 609 94 % 314 68 % 187 Other Segments Macintosh unit sales (a) 290 26 % 230 26 % 182 Total Macintosh unit sales 4,534 38 % 3,290 9 % 3,012 Net Sales by Product: Desktops (b) $ 3,436 45 % $ 2,373 (4 )% $ 2,475 Portables (c) 2,839 11 % 2,550 26 % 2,016 Total Macintosh net sales 6,275 27 % 4,923 10 % 4,491 iPod 4,540 248 % 1,306 279 % 345 Other music related products and services (d) 899 223 % 278 672 % 36 Peripherals and other hardware (e) 1,126 18 % 951 38 % 691 Software, service, and other sales (f) 1,091 33 % 821 27 % 644 Total net sales $ 13,931 68 % $ 8,279 33 % $ 6,207 Unit Sales by Product: Desktops (b) 2,520 55 % 1,625 (8 )% 1,761 Portables (c) 2,014 21 % 1,665 33 % 1,251 Total Macintosh unit sales 4,534 38 % 3,290 9 % 3,012 Net sales per Macintosh unit sold (g) $ 1,384 (7 )% $ 1,496 0 % $ 1,491 iPod unit sales 22,497 409 % 4,416 370 % 939 Net sales per iPod unit sold (h) $ 202 (32 )% $ 296 (19 )% $ 367 Notes: (a) Other Segments include Asia Pacific and FileMaker.

Several factors contributed favorably to net sales during 2005: Net sales of iPods rose $3.2 billion or 248% during 2005 compared to 2004. Unit sales of iPods totaled 22.5 million in 2005, which represents an increase of 409% from the 4.4 million iPod units sold in 2004. Strong sales of iPods during 2005 continued to be experienced in all of the Companys operating segments and was driven by strong demand for the iPod shuffle introduced in January 2005, the release of an updated version of the iPod mini in February 2005, the release of the iPod nano in September 2005, and expansion of the iPods distribution network. Net sales per iPod unit sold decreased 32% primarily due to the introduction of the lower priced iPod shuffle in January 2005 and iPod mini pricing reductions in February 2005. From the introduction of the iPod in 2002 through 2005, the Company has sold approximately 28 million iPods. Other music related products and services consists of sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod services and accessories. Net sales of other music related products and services increased $621 million or 223% during 2005 compared to 2004. The Company has experienced strong growth in sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall iPod unit sales for 2005. The increased sales from the iTunes Music Store is primarily due to substantial growth of net sales in the U.S. and expansion in Europe, Canada, and Japan. Total Macintosh net sales increased $1.4 billion or 27% during 2005 compared to 2004. Unit sales of Macintosh systems increased 1.2 million units or 38% during 2005 compared to 2004. The increases in Macintosh net sales and unit sales relate primarily to strong demand for the Companys desktop products, which was experienced in all of the Companys operating segments. The Company believes that the success of the iPod is having a positive impact on Macintosh net sales by introducing new customers to the Companys other products. Desktop demand was stimulated in 2005 due to the new iMac G5 and the introduction of the Mac mini in January 2005. Net sales and unit sales of desktop products increased 45% and 55%, respectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. Macintosh net sales and unit sales also include sales of the Companys portable products, which increased 11% and 21%, respectively, compared to 2004. Net sales per Macintosh unit sold decreased 7% on a year over year basis. The decrease was the result of changes in the overall unit mix towards relatively lower priced consumer products, specifically the impact of the Mac mini product, and desktop and portable price reductions. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the proportion of direct sales. The Retail segments net sales grew 98% to $2.4 billion during 2005 compared to 2004. This increase is largely attributable to the increase in total stores from 86 at the end of 2004 to 124 at the end of 2005, as well as 44% year over year increase in average revenue per store. While the Companys customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may elect to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Companys preexisting sales channels in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K., the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales is incremental to the Companys total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance. Net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 18% during 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer accessories. Net sales of other hardware include AirPort cards and base stations, Xserve RAID storage, iSight digital video cameras, and third party hardware products. The Companys U.S. education channel experienced year over year growth in both net sales and unit sales of approximately 21% for 2005. The increase in U.S. education net sales for 2005 relates 32 primarily to a 32% year over year increase in higher education net sales due to increased iMac shipments, portable system shipments, and online sales. The Company also experienced 11% growth in K 12 net sales due to increased iBook sales and education 1:1 sales. While net sales to the K 12 market were slightly higher during 2005 than 2004, the Company believes this market continues to be subject to budget constraints and competitive pressures. Net sales of software, service and other sales rose $270 million or 33% during 2005 compared to 2004. This growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales in AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended service and support contracts, driven primarily by higher associated Macintosh computer sales. Additionally, the Company experienced increases in net sales of .Mac Internet service, professional and consumer applications, third party software, and Mac OS X that was primarily attributable to the release of version 10.4 Tiger in April 2005. Fiscal Year 2004 versus 2003 During 2004, net sales increased 33% or $2.1 billion from 2003. Several factors contributed favorably to net sales during 2004: Net sales of Macintosh systems increased $432 million or 10% during 2004 compared to 2003 while net sales per Macintosh unit sold remained relatively flat on a year over year basis. Unit sales of Macintosh systems increased 278,000 units or 9% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases in net sales and unit sales were a result of strong demand for all of the Companys Macintosh systems, except the iMac. The Companys portable systems, consisting of the PowerBook and iBook, produced the strongest revenue and unit growth during 2004 compared to 2003 of approximately 26% and 33%, respectively. Unit sales of portable systems accounted for 51% of all Macintosh systems sold during 2004 compared to only 42% during 2003. The Company believes that these results reflected an overall trend in the industry towards portable systems. Performance of the Companys Power Macintosh systems also yielded positive results in 2004 over 2003, including a 15% and 6% increase in net sales and unit sales, respectively. The increase in Power Macintosh sales in 2004 was due primarily to the introduction of the Power Mac G5, which began shipping at the end of 2003. Although Power Macintosh sales increased from 2003, sales of this product were constrained in the second half of 2004 as a result of manufacturing problems at IBM, the Companys sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor. Net sales of iPods rose $961 million or 279% during 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales of iPods totaled 4.4 million in 2004, which represents an increase of 370% from the 939,000 iPod units sold in 2003. Strong demand for the iPods during 2004 were experienced in all of the Companys operating segments and was driven by enhancements to the iPod, the introduction of the iPod mini, increased expansion of the Companys iPod distribution network, and continued success of the iTunes Music Store due largely to making it available to both Macintosh and Windows users in the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany. The Retail segments net sales grew 91% to $1.2 billion during 2004 compared to 2003. This increase was largely attributable to the increase in total stores from 65 at the end of 2003 to 86 at the end of 2004, as well as a 36% year over year increase in average revenue per store. While the Companys customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may have elected to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Companys preexisting sales channels in the U.S. and Japan, the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales is incremental to the Companys total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance. Net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 38% during 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer accessories. Net sales of other 33 computer accessories include AirPort cards and base stations, iSight digital video cameras, and third party hardware products. The increase in total net sales of peripherals and other hardware was related to the overall increase in Macintosh unit sales and the introduction of new and updated peripheral products and was experienced predominantly by the Companys Americas, Europe, and Retail segments. Net sales of other music related products and services increased $242 million or 672% during 2004 compared to 2003. The Company experienced strong growth in sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall iPod unit sales for 2004. The increased sales from the iTunes Music Store, which was originally introduced in April 2003, was primarily due to making the service available for Windows in October 2003 and the introduction of the service in the U.K., France, and Germany in June 2004. Net sales of software rose $140 million or 39% during 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to higher net sales of the Companys Apple branded software and in particular, higher net sales of the Companys operating system software, including Mac OS X version 10.3 Panther, which was released in October 2003. Net sales of Panther accounted for approximately $74 million or over 50% of the increase in software net sales for 2004 compared to 2003. The Companys U.S. education channel experienced year over year growth in net sales of approximately 19% for 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales also increased by 10% during 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in U.S. education net sales for 2004 related primarily to a 40% year over year increase in higher education net sales and to a lesser extent the Companys 3% growth in K 12 net sales. Service and other sales increased $37 million or 13% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases were the result of significant year over year increases in net sales associated with APP extended maintenance and support services, as well as increased net sales associated with the Companys .Mac Internet service. Increased net sales associated with APP were primarily the result of higher Macintosh unit sales and higher attach rates on APP over the last several years. Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net sales during 2004 were negatively impacted by the following: Net sales and unit sales of iMac systems were down 23% and 16%, respectively, during 2004 versus 2003. The decrease in iMac net sales and unit sales was largely due to the delay in the introduction of the new iMac, based on the PowerPC G5 processor, primarily as a result of manufacturing problems experienced by IBM. The delays in the new iMac resulted in the depletion of inventory of the old iMac flat panel prior to availability of the new iMac G5. The old flat panel iMac form factor, which was available during most of 2004, was nearly 3 years old by the time the new iMac G5 began shipping in September 2004 and had experienced declines in sales as a result of the age of this product. The Company believes that sales of iMac systems have also declined due to a shift in consumer preference to portable systems and desktop models from competitors with price points below $1,000. Net sales and unit sales in the Companys Japan segment decreased 3% and 14%, respectively, during 2004 versus 2003. The Company believes these declines related to a shift in sales from the Japan segment to the Retail segment as a result of the Tokyo and Osaka store openings in 2004. Declines in net sales in Japan may have also related to delays in computer upgrades by certain professional and creative customers pending release in Japan of certain Mac OS X native applications, such as Quark Xpress 6, which did not become available until September 2004. When sales from the Japan retail stores are included in the results for the Japan segment, the combined revenue in Japan resulted in a 3% year over year increase in 2004 as compared to 2003. See 34 additional comments below related to the Japan segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operated Apple owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. during 2005. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys operating segments may be found in Item 8 of this Form 10 K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data. Americas During 2005, net sales in the Americas segment grew 64% or $2.6 billion compared to 2004. The increase in net sales during 2005 was primarily attributable to the significant year over year increase in iPod sales, sales of other music related products and services, and strong sales of desktop and portable Macintosh systems. This increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the Retail segment, which had 117 stores in the U.S. and Canada as of the end of 2005. Macintosh unit sales also increased by 30% in 2005 compared to 2004, driven primarily by strong sales of desktop systems largely attributable to strong sales from the new iMac, which began shipping in September 2004, and the Mac mini, which was introduced in January 2005. During 2005 and 2004, the Americas segment represented approximately 47% and 49%, respectively, of the Companys total net sales and represented approximately 48% and 51%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. As noted above, the Company experienced an increase in both U.S. education channel net sales and unit sales of 21% for 2005 compared to 2004. Strength in higher education sales related primarily to strong iMac shipments, portable system shipments, and online sales. This strength drove year over year growth in net sales of 32% for the higher education channel during 2005. Despite challenges in the K 12 market from continued budget constraints and competitive pressures, the Companys K 12 net sales grew year over year by 11% during 2005 due to increased iBook sales and 1:1 education sales. During 2004, net sales in the Americas segment grew 26% or $838 million compared to 2003. The increase in net sales during 2004 was primarily attributable to the significant year over year increase in iPod sales as well as strong sales of peripherals, software, and services. This increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the Retail segment, which had 84 stores in the U.S. as of the end of 2004. Macintosh unit sales also increased by 4% in 2004 compared to 2003, driven primarily by strong sales of portable and Power Macintosh systems, partially offset by weakness in iMac sales. During 2004 and 2003, the Americas segment represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of the Companys total net sales and represented approximately 51% and 54%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. The Company experienced an increase in U.S. education channel net sales of 19% for 2004 compared to 2003. Strong U.S. education net sales for 2004 related primarily to strength in higher education net sales that resulted from a successful back to school selling season with strong demand for the Companys portables. This strength drove year over year growth in net sales of 40% for the higher education channel during 2004. The Companys K 12 net sales grew year over year by 3% during 2004, despite the challenges in the K 12 market from continued budget constraints and increased competition. Europe During 2005, net sales in the Europe segment grew $1.3 billion or 71% from 2004. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing 47% in 2005 compared to 35 2004. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net sales of desktop products, iPod, other music related products and services, and software and service sales. Demand in Europe during 2005 was particularly strong for the Companys desktop computers, which experienced a year over year increase of 56%. Similar to the results of the Companys other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and software were strong in 2005. Net sales in Europe rebounded in 2004 increasing $490 million or 37% from 2003. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe also experienced growth in 2004 by increasing 13% compared to 2003. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net sales across all product lines, except the iMac systems. Demand in Europe during 2004 was particularly strong for the Companys Power Macintosh systems and portable Macintosh systems, which experienced year over year increases of 29% and 42%, respectively. Similar to the results of the Companys other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and software were strong in 2004 over 2003. Japan Japans net sales and Macintosh unit sales were up 36% and 8%, respectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. Japan experienced increased net sales in desktop products, iPod, and other music related products and services. Desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 31% and 41%, respectively, and iPod sales increased by 220% during 2005 compared to 2004. The overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline in portable system net sales during 2005 compared to 2004, which the Company believes might be attributable to a shift in sales from portables to the new iMac G5 and Mac mini, and a shift to the Retail segment as a result of opening two additional stores in Japan during 2005. Japans net sales and Macintosh unit sales were down 3% and 14%, respectively, during 2004 compared to 2003, which lagged behind all of the Companys other operating segments. These decreases in net sales and unit sales were believed to be attributable in part to a shift in sales from the Japan segment to the Retail segment as a result of the opening of two stores in Japan in 2004. In addition, such decreases may have been related to delayed computer system upgrades by some professional and creative customers who were awaiting the release of Quark XPress 6 for Mac OS X, which did not occur until September 2004. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by strong iPod and iBook sales during 2004 compared to 2003. Retail The Company opened 38 new retail stores during 2005, including 6 international stores in the U.K, Japan, and Canada, bringing the total number of open stores to 124 as of September 24, 2005. This compares to 86 open stores as of September 25, 2004 and 65 open stores as of September 27, 2003. Net sales of the Retail segment grew to $2.4 billion during 2005 from $1.2 billion and $621 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increases in net sales during both 2005 and 2004 reflect the impact of new store openings for each year, including the opening of 38 new stores in 2005 and 21 new stores in 2004. An increase in average revenue per store also contributed to the segments strong sales in 2005. With an average of 105 stores open during 2005, the Retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $22.4 million, as compared to $15.6 million in 2004 with a 76 store average, and $11.5 million in 2003 with a 54 store average. As measured by the Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $151 million during 2005 as compared to operating income of $39 million during 2004 and an operating loss of $5 million during 2003. This improvement is primarily attributable to the segments year over year increase in average revenue per store, the impact of opening new stores, and the segments year over year increase in net sales, which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation, and other fixed costs. 36 Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment were $132 million in 2005, bringing the total capital expenditures since inception of the Retail segment to approximately $529 million. As of September 24, 2005, the Retail segment had approximately 3,673 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately $606 million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Gross Margin Gross margin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): September 24, 2005 September 25, 2004 September 27, 2003 Net sales $ 13,931 $ 8,279 $ 6,207 Cost of sales 9,888 6,020 4,499 Gross margin $ 4,043 $ 2,259 $ 1,708 Gross margin percentage 29.0 % 27.3 % 27.5 % Gross margin increased in 2005 to 29.0% of net sales from 27.3% of net sales in 2004. The Companys gross margin during 2005 increased due to more favorable pricing on certain commodity components including LCD flat panel displays and DRAM memory; an increase in higher margin software sales; a favorable shift in direct sales related primarily to the Companys Retail and online stores; and higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs. These increases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower margin iPod sales. The Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer and consumer electronics industries will remain under pressure in light of price competition, especially for the iPod product line. The Company expects gross margin percentage to decline in the first quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such as the iPod and content from the iTunes Music Store. The foregoing statements regarding the Companys expected gross margin are forward looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained or targeted gross margin levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products, including iPods, will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Companys product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Companys ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates. 37 The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Companys operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns. Gross margin declined in 2004 to 27.3% of net sales from 27.5% of net sales in 2003. The Companys gross margin during 2004 declined due to an increase in mix towards lower margin iPod and iBook sales, pricing actions on certain Power Macintosh G5 models that were transitioned during the beginning of 2004, higher warranty costs on certain portable Macintosh products, and higher freight and duty costs during 2004. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by an increase in direct sales and a 39% year over year increase in higher margin software sales. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): September 24, September 25, September 27, 2005 2004 2003 Research and development $ 534 $ 489 $ 471 Percentage of net sales 4 % 6 % 8 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 1,859 $ 1,421 $ 1,212 Percentage of net sales 13 % 17 % 20 % Restructuring costs $ $ 23 $ 26 Research and Development (R&D) The Company recognizes that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Companys core business strategy. The Company has historically relied upon innovation to remain competitive. R&D expense amounted to approximately 4% of total net sales during 2005 down from 6% and 8% of total net sales in 2004 and 2003, respectively. This decrease is due to the significant increase of 68% in total net sales of the Company for 2005. Although R&D expense decreased as a percentage of total net sales in 2005, actual expense for R&D in 2005 increased $45 million or 9% from 2004, which follows an $18 million or 4% increase in 2004 compared to 2003. The overall increase in R&D expense relates primarily to increased headcount and support for new product development activities and the impact of employee salary increases in 2005. R&D expense does not include capitalized software development costs of approximately $29.7 million related to the development of Mac OS X Tiger during 2005; $4.5 million related to the development of Mac OS X Tiger and $2.3 million related to the development of FileMaker Pro 7 in 2004; and $14.7 million related to the development of Mac OS X Panther in 2003. Further information related to the Companys capitalization of software development costs may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A) Expenditures for SG&A increased $438 million or 31% during 2005 compared to 2004. These increases are due primarily to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, and higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary 38 merit increases. SG&A as a percentage of total net sales in 2005 was 13%, down from 17% in 2004, which is due to the increase in total net sales of 68% for the Company during 2005. Expenditures for SG&A increased $209 million or 17% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases were due primarily to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, an increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, an increase in amortization costs associated with restricted stock compensation, and higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary merit increases. SG&A as a percentage of total net sales in 2004 was 17%, down from 20% in 2003 due to the increase in total net sales for the Company of 33% during 2004. Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Actions The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23 million during 2004, including approximately $14 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and a $3.5 million charge for lease cancellations in conjunction with the vacating of a leased sales facility in Europe during the fourth quarter of 2004 related to a European workforce reduction. Of the $23 million charge, $19.7 million had been utilized by the end of 2005, with the remaining $3.3 million consisting of $0.7 million for employee severance benefits and $2.6 million for lease cancellations. These actions will result in the termination of 461 employees, 448 of which had been terminated prior to the end of 2005. Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during 2003, including approximately $7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments, and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations primarily related to the closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing operations during the first quarter of 2003. Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been utilized by the end of 2005, except for approximately $1.7 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. These actions resulted in the termination of 353 employees. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions): September 24, September 25, September 27, 2005 2004 2003 Gains on non current investments, net $ $ 4 $ 10 Interest income $ 183 $ 64 $ 69 Interest expense (3 ) (8 ) Gains on sales of short term investments, net 1 21 Other income (expense), net (18 ) (9 ) 1 Interest and Other Income, net $ 165 $ 53 $ 83 Total other income and expense $ 165 $ 57 $ 93 Gains and Losses on Non current Investments The Company previously held significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). The Company sold all of the remaining holdings in these non current investments in 2004 and 2003. Pretax gains recorded upon the sale of these non current investments were $4 million and $10 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. 39 Interest and Other Income, Net Total interest and other income, net increased $112 million or 211% to $165 million during 2005 compared to $53 million in 2004 and $83 million in 2003. These increases are attributable primarily to increasing investment yields on the Companys cash and short term investments and higher invested balances. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments increased to 2.70% in 2005 compared to the 1.38% and 1.89% rates earned during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company occasionally sells short term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net losses of $137,000 in 2005 and net gains of $1 million and $21 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. Partially offsetting the increase in other income were higher foreign currency hedging expenses. Interest expense consisted primarily of interest on the Companys $300 million aggregate principal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004. The unsecured notes were sold at 99.925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting from the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized as of the notes maturity in February 2004. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate for the year ended September 24, 2005 was approximately 26%. The Companys effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., research and development tax credits, and a reduction of certain tax contingency reserves and adjustments to net deferred tax assets. The benefit from adjustments to tax contingency reserves and net deferred tax assets was $67 million. In addition, the Company recorded a $25 million reduction of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets that, in managements opinion, are now more likely than not to be realized in the future. $14 million of the valuation allowance reduction was recorded as a credit to income tax expense, and the remainder was recorded as a credit to goodwill. As of September 24, 2005, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $767 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Companys balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. As of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $5 million and $30 million, respectively, was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax loss carryforwards that may not be realized. The remaining valuation allowance at September 24, 2005 relates principally to certain state operating loss carryforwards. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for all years prior to 2002 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the 40 AJCA. The legislation provided the Company with the option to apply this provision to repatriations of qualifying earnings in either 2005 or 2006. The Company is continuing to evaluate the effects of the repatriation provision and expects to complete the evaluation in 2006. A maximum of $755 million may be eligible for repatriation under the reduced tax rate provided by AJCA. However, given the uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the Companys continuing evaluation, the Company has not yet determined the amount that may be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such repatriation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Nos. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. FSP Nos. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 amend SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, SFAS No. 124, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not for Profit Organizations, as well as APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. This guidance nullifies certain requirements of EITF 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. FSP Nos. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 include guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. FSP Nos. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 also require other than temporary impaired debt securities to be written down to its impaired value, which becomes the new cost basis. FSP Nos. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FSP Nos. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, which amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges. SFAS 151 requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 151, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP 109 2 provides additional time to companies beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the AJCA on their plans for repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Company is currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of AJCA, which if implemented by the Company would affect the Companys tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities. However, given the uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the Companys continuing evaluation, it is not possible at this time to determine the amount, if any, that will be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such repatriation. The Company expects to complete the evaluation in 2006. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such 41 equity instruments. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and instead requires such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method. The Company will recognize stock based compensation expense on all awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period using the modified prospective method. In January 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will result in a reduction of diluted earnings per common share of approximately $0.03 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, to clarify the requirement to record liabilities stemming from a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event. The Company plans to adopt FIN 47 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, and does not expect the application of FIN 47 to have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections which replaces APB Opinion No. 20 Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principal unless it is not practicable. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 154, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions): September 24, September 25, September 27, 2005 2004 2003 Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ 8,261 $ 5,464 $ 4,566 Accounts receivable, net $ 895 $ 774 $ 766 Inventory $ 165 $ 101 $ 56 Working capital $ 6,816 $ 4,404 $ 3,530 Days sales in accounts receivable (DSO) (a) 22 30 41 Days of supply in inventory (b) 6 5 4 Days payables outstanding (DPO) (c) 62 76 82 Annual operating cash flow $ 2,535 $ 934 $ 289 (a) DSO is based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period. (b) Days supply of inventory is based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period. (c) DPO is based on ending accounts payable and most recent quarterly cost of sales adjusted for the change in inventory. As of September 24, 2005, the Company had $8.261 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments, an increase of $2.797 billion over the same balances at the end of 2004. The principal components of this increase were cash generated by operating activities of $2.535 billion and proceeds of $543 million from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, partially offset by cash used to 42 purchase property, plant, and equipment of $260 million. The Companys short term investment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid investments. As of September 24, 2005, approximately $4.3 billion of the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the one time favorable foreign dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and may decide to repatriate earnings from some of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. Capital Expenditures The Companys total capital expenditures were $260 million during 2005, $132 million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment related to the Companys Retail segment and $128 million of which were primarily for corporate infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $390 million for capital expenditures during 2006, approximately $210 million of which is expected to be utilized for further expansion of the Companys Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure. Stock Repurchase Plan In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock during 2005 or 2004. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 24, 2005. On February 28, 2005, the Company effected a two for one stock split to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2005. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. 43 The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 24, 2005 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Companys balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions): Total Payments Due in Less Than 1 year Payments Due in 1 3 years Payments Due in 4 5 years Payments Due in More Than 5 years Operating Leases $ 865 $ 108 $ 211 $ 192 $ 354 Purchase Obligations 1,994 1,994 Asset Retirement Obligations 14 2 2 10 Other Obligations 4 4 Total $ 2,877 $ 2,106 $ 213 $ 194 $ 364 Lease Commitments As of September 24, 2005, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $865 million, $606 million of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Lease terms on the Companys existing major facility operating leases range from 5 to 20 years. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. As of September 24, 2005, the Company had outstanding third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately $2.0 billion. Subsequent to September 24, 2005, the Company entered into long term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company intends to prepay a total of $1.25 billion for flash memory components by the end of the second quarter of 2006. Asset Retirement Obligations The Companys asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September 24, 2005, the Company estimates that gross expected future cash flows of approximately $14 million will be required to fulfill these obligations. Other Obligations The Companys other obligations of approximately $4 million are primarily related to Internet and telecommunications services. Indemnifications The Company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company 44 could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. General economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the Companys products and the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. The Companys operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. At times in the past, demand for the Companys products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some of the Companys education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy and state budget deficits on their available funding. Although recent macroeconomic trends seem to indicate an economic recovery, continued uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the Companys products and related operating results. Should global and or regional economic conditions deteriorate, demand for the Companys products could be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. War, terrorism, public health issues or other business interruptions could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products, which could negatively affect the Companys operations and performance. War, terrorism, public health issues and other business interruptions whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Companys suppliers or customers. The Companys major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, other natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake related losses, the Companys operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events could result in a decrease in demand for the Companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to deliver products to its customers or to receive components from its suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply chain. In addition, should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by these events. 45 The market for personal computers and related peripherals and services, as well as digital music devices and related services, is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected. The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense as competitors who sell Windows and Linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for personal computing products. The Companys results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. The personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Companys existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Companys key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the Companys competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music products and or online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Companys products. The Company has a significant number of competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Companys markets. The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing other competing operating systems, including Windows and Linux. The Companys future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms. Additionally, if unauthorized copies of the Mac OS are used on other companies hardware products and result in decreased demand for the Companys hardware products, the Companys results of operations may be adversely affected. The Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices, including iPods. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products, including music enabled cell phones, distribution services, and free peer to peer music services. These competitors include both new entrants with different market approaches, such as subscription services models, and also larger companies that may have greater technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than those of the Company, as well as established hardware, software, and digital content supplier relationships. Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Companys operating results and financial position. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully distribute and sell digital music outside the U.S. The Company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering prices and or increasing features which could adversely affect the Companys music product gross margins as well as overall Company gross margins. 46 The Company also faces increased competition in the U.S. education market. U.S. elementary and secondary schools, as well as college and university customers, remain a core market for the Company. Uncertainty in this channel remains as several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers, which could negatively affect the Companys market share. In an effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and will continue to pursue one to one (1:1) learning solutions in education. 1:1 learning solutions typically consist of iBook portable systems for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server. These 1:1 learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Companys operating results and financial condition. The Companys transition from PowerPC microprocessors used by Macintosh computers to microprocessors built by Intel is subject to numerous risks. In June 2005, the Company announced its intention to transition from the use of PowerPC microprocessors to the use of Intel microprocessors in all of its Macintosh computers by the end of calendar year 2007. This transition is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the Companys ability to timely develop and deliver new products using Intel microprocessors, the timely innovation and delivery of related hardware and software products, including the Companys applications, to support Intel microprocessors, market acceptance of Intel based Macintosh computers, the development and availability on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the Company to timely deliver Intel based Macintosh computers, and the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand for both PowerPC and Intel based Macintosh computers. In addition, the Company is dependent on third party software developers such as Microsoft and Adobe continuing to support current applications that run on PowerPC based computers and timely developing versions of current and future applications that run on Intel and PowerPC based Macintosh computers. The Companys inability to timely deliver new Intel based products or obtain developer commitment both to continue supporting applications that run on PowerPC microprocessors and timely transition their applications to run natively on Intel based products may have an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations. The Companys announcement of its intention to transition to Intel microprocessors may negatively impact sales of current and future Macintosh products containing PowerPC microprocessors, as customers may elect to delay purchases until the Intel based products are available. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its historical gross margin percentages on its products, including Intel based Macintosh computers, which may adversely impact the Companys results of operations. Future operating results are dependent upon the Companys ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, including microprocessors, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources. Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, NAND flash memory, and TFT LCD flat panel displays), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have 47 experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Companys requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Companys ability to produce and market competitive products is dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (Freescale) to supply PowerPC microprocessors and Intel to supply its microprocessors for the Companys Macintosh computers and to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Companys competitors. While the Company has supply agreements with IBM and Freescale, the Companys recent announcement of plans to transition to Intel microprocessors may impact the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services, including PowerPC G4 and G5 microprocessors, which are essential to the Companys business and are currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources. Additionally, there have been instances in recent years where the inability of the Companys suppliers to provide advanced PowerPC microprocessors in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Companys results of operations. In addition, IBM is currently the Companys sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor, which is used in the Companys current Power Mac, Xserve, and iMac G5 products. Freescale is the sole supplier of the G4 processor, which is used in the Companys eMac, Mac mini, and portable products. IBM experienced manufacturing problems with the PowerPC G5 processor, which resulted in the Company delaying the shipment of various products and constrained certain product shipments during the second half of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. Manufacturing problems experienced by any of the Companys suppliers in the future or failure by them to deliver components to the Company in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, which are characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the Companys existing products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance; the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, including the transition to Intel based Macintosh computers, and production ramp issues; the availability of application software for new products; the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, including anticipated demand for PowerPC based and Intel based Macintosh computers; the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. The Companys products from time to time experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits. The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. 48 Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to remedy. Because orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk. The Company records a write down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are currently adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries and the transition to Intel based Macintosh computers, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, and because of the transition to Intel based Macintosh computers, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns. The Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S. Most of the Companys products are manufactured in whole or in part by third party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations, they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured or services rendered, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Companys future operating results and financial condition. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is currently performed in the Companys manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the Peoples Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacturing of many of the components used in the Companys products is performed by third party vendors in Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. Final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and iPods is performed by third party vendors in China. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, as well as information technology system failures or military actions, the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 49 The Companys future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Companys products. The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company sells many of its products and resells certain third party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail stores. Many of the Companys resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by weak economic conditions over the last several years. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Companys products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors. These programs could require a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment. Over the past several years, an increasing proportion of the Companys net sales has been made by the Company directly to end users through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. Some of the Companys resellers have perceived this expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their own businesses and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the Companys products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Companys resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Companys products. The Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Companys products. Further information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10 K under the heading Markets and Distribution. The Company relies on third party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with third parties to offer their digital content to customers through the Companys iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this third party digital content. The Companys licensing arrangements with these third party content providers are short term in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Certain parties in the music industry have consolidated and formed alliances, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer digital content to customers through the iTunes Music Store. Further, some third party content providers currently, or may in the future, offer music products and services that compete with the Companys music products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their digital content in the future. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of digital content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach outside the U.S., then sales and gross margins of the Companys iTunes Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals, including iPods, may be adversely affected. Third party content providers and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms. If the requirements from content providers or artists change, then the Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or license 50 such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results and financial position. The Companys future performance is dependent upon support from third party software developers. If third party software applications cease to be developed or available for the Companys hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Companys products. The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Companys personal computers, as opposed to Windows based systems, are often based on the availability of third party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third party application software for the Companys hardware products depends in part on third party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Companys products versus software for the larger Windows market or growing Linux market. This analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market has caused software developers to question the Companys prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market or growing Linux market. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Companys operating system, on a timely basis or at all. In June 2005, the Company announced its plan to begin using Intel microprocessors in its Macintosh computers. The Company plans to begin shipping certain models with Intel microprocessors by June 2006 and to complete this transition to Intel microprocessors for all of its Macintosh computers by the end of calendar year 2007. The Company depends on third party software developers to timely develop current and future applications that run on Intel and PowerPC microprocessors. The Companys inability to timely deliver new Intel based products, or a decline in available applications that run on the Companys PowerPC products or the lack of applications that run on Intel based Macintosh systems could have a materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results and financial position. In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers, such as Microsoft and Adobe, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Companys products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence the decisions of third party software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh compatible software products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, professional digital photo editing and workflow management, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop based database management, word processing, and high quality presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application. Discontinuance of third party products for the Macintosh platform, including Microsoft Office could have an adverse effect on the Companys net sales and results of operations. 51 The Companys business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Companys future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms. Because of technological changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third party, the Companys future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10 K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10 K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Companys retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Through October 2005, the Company had opened 126 retail stores. The Companys retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segments costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment experience a significant decline in sales for any reason. Certain of the Companys stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Companys more typical retail stores. The Company has opened seven such stores through October 2005. Because of their location and size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 14 years with total 52 remaining commitments per location ranging from $4 million to $46 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Many of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Companys control, that could adversely affect the Retail segments future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and or have an adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among other things, macro economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the U.S.; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple branded and third party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Companys ongoing business and may present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has and may in the future invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the Companys strategic direction and product roadmap. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of managements attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy; and unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence process. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the Companys business, operating results or financial condition. Declines in the sales of the Companys professional products, software, accessories, or service and support contracts, or increases in sales of consumer products, including iPods, may negatively impact the Companys gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Companys professional products, including Power Macintosh and PowerBook systems, software, accessories, and service and support contracts, generally have higher gross margins than the Companys consumer products, including iMacs, iBooks, iPods, and content from the iTunes Music Store. A shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the Companys future gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Companys traditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products, specifically the iMac G5 and iBook, instead of professional products. Professional users may choose to buy the iMac G5 due to its relative price performance, use of the same PowerPC G5 processor used in the Companys Power Macs, and unique design featuring a flat panel screen. Potential PowerBook customers may also choose to purchase iBooks instead due to their price performance and screen size. Additionally, significant future growth in iPod sales without corresponding growth in higher margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages. It is likely that some of the Companys current and potential professional, creative, and small business customers, who are most likely to utilize professional systems, believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the Company utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other computer manufacturers and translates to slower overall system performance. These factors may result in an adverse impact to sales of the Companys professional products as well as to gross margin and operating margin percentages. 53 The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons. The Companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Companys direct sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have higher associated profitability than its indirect sales. Additionally, the Companys direct channels have traditionally had more sales of software and higher priced hardware products, which generally have higher gross margins, than its indirect channels. As a result, the Companys gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic, or channel mix, or new product announcements, including the transition to Intel based Macintosh computers. In addition, the Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Companys internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Companys ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower than anticipated demand for the Companys products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Companys key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition. The Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors. The Companys ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the Companys Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Companys brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long term supply agreements. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has entered into long term supply agreements to secure supply of NAND flash memory and intends to prepay a total of $1.25 billion under these agreements. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments, there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors. The Companys success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of 54 the Companys key employees are located. The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Recent accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options will impair the Companys future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel. The Company is subject to risks associated with the selection, availability, and cost of insurance. The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional commercial insurance. Such conditions have and may continue to result in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, lower coverage limits and may also yield possible policy form exclusions. For some risks, because of cost and or availability, the Company does not have insurance coverage. Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial position. Failure of information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon which the Company relies could adversely affect the Companys future operating results. Information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Companys ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns for its own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the Company or a third party vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. The Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations. A large portion of the Companys revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Companys operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Companys products and the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can cause the Company to modify international pricing and affect the value of the Companys foreign denominated sales, and in some cases, may also increase the cost to the Company of some product components. Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. 55 Further information related to the Companys global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10 K under the subheading Foreign Currency Risk and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations. Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member countries, Japan, and certain states within the U.S. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. Changes in accounting rules could affect the Companys future operating results. Financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies, including the FASB and the SEC, who create and interpret appropriate accounting standards. A change from current accounting standards could have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued new guidance that addresses the accounting for share based payments, SFAS No. 123R. In April 2005, the SEC deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 123R to years beginning after June 15, 2005. Therefore, SFAS No. 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will result in a reduction of diluted earnings per common share of approximately $0.03 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Although the effect from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, future changes to various assumptions used to determine the fair value of awards issued or the amount and type of equity awards granted create uncertainty as to the amount of future stock based compensation expense. Changes in the Companys tax rates could affect its future results. The Companys future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse affect on the Companys net income and financial condition. The Companys stock price may be volatile. The Companys stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of positive general economic and political conditions and investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Companys stock in the future. In addition, increases in the Companys stock price may result in greater dilution of earnings per share. 56 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate swap and option positions, both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys operating results and financial position. Interest Rate Risk While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries, the Companys interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. The Companys short term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Companys investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio. The Company places its short term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short term investments. As of September 24, 2005, approximately $287 million of the Companys short term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of September 25, 2004, $180 million of the Companys investment portfolio classified as short term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities, due to liquidity needs, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized a net loss before taxes of $137,000 in 2005, and net gains before taxes of $1 million and $21 million in 2004, and 2003, respectively as a result of such sales. In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2005, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $19.9 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 25, 2004, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $14.4 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Except in instances noted above, the Companys policy is to hold investments to maturity. 57 From time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the Companys floating rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short term investments with its fixed rate interest expense on its debt, and or to diversify a portion of the Companys exposure away from fluctuations in short term U.S. interest rates. The Company did not enter into any interest rate derivatives during 2005 or 2004 and had no open interest rate derivatives at September 24, 2005. Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. In order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Companys foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Companys foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of $10.0 million as of September 24, 2005 compared to a maximum one day loss of $3.2 million as of September 25, 2004. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2005 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Companys actual exposures and positions. 58
