Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Form 10 K contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward looking statements can also be identified by words such as anticipates, expects, believes, plans, predicts, and similar terms. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Companys actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled Risk Factors above. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. All information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. The following information has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of the Companys financial results, which is more fully described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and in Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. The net of tax impact of the adjustments, which amounted to $4 million in 2006, was recorded by the Company in its fourth quarter of 2006. The net of tax impact of the restatements on the Companys results of operations amounted to $7 million and $10 million in 2005 and 2004, 48 respectively. The impact of these adjustments was not significant to the Companys operating results, trends, or liquidity for the annual or quarterly periods in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Executive Overview The Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable digital music players along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third party music, audio books, music videos, short films, television shows, movies, and iPod games. The Companys products and services include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the iPod line of portable digital music players, the Xserve server and Xserve RAID storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, the iTunes Store, a portfolio of peripherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod product lines, and a variety of other service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third party wholesalers, resellers, and value added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third party Macintosh and iPod compatible products including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business, and government customers. A further description of the Companys products may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10 K under the heading Business. The Company believes that for both professionals and consumers the personal computer has become the center of an evolving digital lifestyle by integrating and enhancing the utility of advanced digital devices such as the Companys iPods, digital video and still cameras, televisions, CD and DVD players, cellular phones, personal digital assistants, and other consumer electronic devices. The attributes of the personal computer that enable this functionality include a high quality user interface, easy access to relatively inexpensive data storage, the ability to run complex applications, and the ability to connect easily to a wide variety of other digital devices and to the Internet. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer from the hardware and operating system to sophisticated applications. This, along with its products innovative industrial designs, intuitive ease of use, built in graphics, multimedia and networking capabilities, uniquely positions the Company to offer innovative integrated digital lifestyle solutions. The Companys business strategy leverages its ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers around the world compelling new products and solutions with superior ease of use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Macintosh line of computers, consumer electronics with its iPod line of portable digital music players, and distribution of third party digital content through its online iTunes Store. While the Company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal computer and consumer electronic markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these are all highly competitive markets that are subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition. To remain competitive, the Company believes increased investment in research and development (R&D) and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain and extend its position in the markets where it competes. The Companys R&D spending is focused on delivering timely updates and enhancements to its existing line of personal computers, displays, operating systems, software applications, and portable digital music players; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas such as rack mount servers, RAID storage systems, and wireless technologies. The Company also believes investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness. 49 In June 2005, the Company announced its plan to begin using Intel microprocessors in its computers. During 2006, the Company introduced new Intel based models of the MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Pro, iMac, and Mac mini computers. The Companys transition to Intel microprocessors for Macintosh systems was completed in August 2006, and its transition for Xserve was completed in November 2006. The MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Pro, iMac, and Mac mini feature Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger, iLife 06, and the Companys new translation technology, Rosetta, which allows most PowerPC based Macintosh applications to run on Intel based Macintosh computers. There are potential risks and uncertainties that may occur due to this transition, which are further discussed in Item 1A under the heading Risk Factors. The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Macintosh computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Macintosh with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high quality sales and after sales support experience is critical to attracting and retaining customers. To ensure a high quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company has expanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 165 stores open as of September 30, 2006. The Company also staffs selected third party stores with the Companys own employees to improve the buying experience through reseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees and contractors in reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world. To improve access to the iPod product line, the Company has significantly expanded the number of distribution points where iPods are sold. The iPod product line can be purchased in certain department stores, member only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels listed above. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations require the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock based compensation, and income taxes. Management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting 50 standards, including American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and volume based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. If refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company distributes its products through third party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with third party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct customers. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic 51 environment, the financial condition of the Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customers financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments were made. Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write down for inventories of components and products, including third party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer and consumer electronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write downs were recorded. The Company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified. Warranty Costs The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Companys results of operations. The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. Stock Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair value as calculated by the Black Scholes Merton (BSM) option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly 52 judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In connection with the Companys restatement of its consolidated financial statements, the Company has applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates for prior option grants. Information regarding the restatement, including ranges of possible additional stock based compensation expense if other measurement dates had been selected for certain grants, is set forth in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and in Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys results of operations and financial position. 53 Net Sales Net sales and Macintosh unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product follow (net sales in millions and unit sales in thousands): September 30, September 24, September 25, 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Net Sales by Operating Segment: Americas net sales $ 9,307 41 % $ 6,590 64 % $ 4,019 Europe net sales 4,094 33 % 3,073 71 % 1,799 Japan net sales 1,208 31 % 920 36 % 677 Retail net sales 3,359 43 % 2,350 98 % 1,185 Other Segments net sales (a) 1,347 35 % 998 67 % 599 Total net sales $ 19,315 39 % $ 13,931 68 % $ 8,279 Unit Sales by Operating Segment: Americas Macintosh unit sales 2,432 11 % 2,184 30 % 1,682 Europe Macintosh unit sales 1,346 18 % 1,138 47 % 773 Japan Macintosh unit sales 304 (3 )% 313 8 % 291 Retail Macintosh unit sales 886 45 % 609 94 % 314 Other Segments Macintosh unit sales (a) 335 16 % 290 26 % 230 Total Macintosh unit sales 5,303 17 % 4,534 38 % 3,290 Net Sales by Product: Desktops (b) $ 3,319 (3 )% $ 3,436 45 % $ 2,373 Portables (c) 4,056 43 % 2,839 11 % 2,550 Total Macintosh net sales 7,375 18 % 6,275 27 % 4,923 iPod 7,676 69 % 4,540 248 % 1,306 Other music related products and services (d) 1,885 110 % 899 223 % 278 Peripherals and other hardware (e) 1,100 (2 )% 1,126 18 % 951 Software, service, and other sales (f) 1,279 17 % 1,091 33 % 821 Total net sales $ 19,315 39 % $ 13,931 68 % $ 8,279 Unit Sales by Product: Desktops (b) 2,434 (3 )% 2,520 55 % 1,625 Portables (c) 2,869 42 % 2,014 21 % 1,665 Total Macintosh unit sales 5,303 17 % 4,534 38 % 3,290 Net sales per Macintosh unit sold (g) $ 1,391 1 % $ 1,384 (7 )% $ 1,496 iPod unit sales 39,409 75 % 22,497 409 % 4,416 Net sales per iPod unit sold (h) $ 195 (3 )% $ 202 (32 )% $ 296 Notes: (a) Other Segments include Asia Pacific and FileMaker.

This increase was due in part to the fact that 2006 spanned 53 weeks while 2005 spanned 52 weeks. Several other factors contributed to these increases including the following: Net sales of iPods increased $3.1 billion or 69% during 2006 compared to 2005. Unit sales of iPods totaled 39.4 million in 2006, which represents an increase of 75% from 22.5 million iPod units sold in 2005. Strong iPod sales during 2006 reflected significant sales of both the hard drive based iPod that supports video, first introduced in October of 2005 and the iPod nano, introduced in September 2005, as well as continued expansion of iPod distribution points. During 2006, the net sales per iPod unit sold decreased by 3% compared to 2005 primarily due to an overall decrease in average selling prices for all iPods as well as a shift in product mix to the iPod nano. From the introduction of the iPod in 2002 through 2006, the Company has sold approximately 68 million iPods. Macintosh net sales increased $1.1 billion or 18% during 2006 compared to 2005. Macintosh unit sales increased by 769,000 units or 17% during 2006 compared to 2005. These increases were mainly due to strong demand for the Intel based MacBook and MacBook Pro systems and reflect a shift in product mix to portable products in all of the Companys operating segments. Net sales and unit sales of the Companys portable products increased 43% and 42%, respectively, during 2006 compared to 2005. Macintosh desktop net sales and unit sales both decreased by 3% during 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in sales of the Companys Macintosh desktops was due to declines in sales of the Companys professional oriented desktop products. The Company believes the decline in the Companys professional oriented desktop products was due to customers delaying purchases of such products in anticipation of the release of the Intel based Mac Pro, which did not begin shipping until August 2006, and updated software applications capable of running on Intel based Macintosh computers, and the trend toward portable computers. A slight increase of 1% during 2006 in net sales per Macintosh unit sold was due to a shift in mix to higher priced portable products, partially offset by price reductions on certain Macintosh systems. Other music related products and services consists of sales associated with the iTunes Store and iPod services and accessories. Net sales of other music related products and services increased $986 million or 110% during 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to increased net sales from the iTunes Store and Apple branded and third party iPod accessories and services. The increase in sales from the iTunes Store stemmed from significant growth in U.S. sales and the opening of The iTunes Store in Japan during August 2005 and Australia during October 2005. The increased sales from the iTunes Store were also attributable to the availability of videos, television shows, and feature length movie downloads. Net sales of software, service, and other sales increased $188 million or 17% during 2006 compared to 2005. The growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales of AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended service and support contracts and application software, partially offset by a decrease in sales of Mac OS X. Mac OS X sales were particularly high in 2005 due to the release of Mac OS X Tiger in April 2005. Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net sales during 2006 were negatively impacted by the following: Net sales of peripherals and other hardware declined $26 million or 2% compared to 2005 primarily due to price decreases and a decrease in net sales of displays relating to a shift in mix from desktop to portable systems. The decrease in net sales of displays for 2006 is consistent with the overall decrease in unit sales of Macintosh professional desktop systems. 55 Fiscal Year 2005 versus 2004 During 2005, net sales increased 68% or $5.7 billion from 2004. Several factors contributed favorably to net sales during 2005: Net sales of iPods rose $3.2 billion or 248% during 2005 compared to 2004. Unit sales of iPods totaled 22.5 million in 2005, which represented an increase of 409% from the 4.4 million iPod units sold in 2004. Strong sales of iPods during 2005 were experienced in all of the Companys operating segments and was driven by strong demand for the iPod shuffle introduced in January 2005, the release of an updated version of the iPod mini in February 2005, the release of the iPod nano in September 2005, and expansion of the iPods distribution network. Net sales per iPod unit sold decreased 32% primarily due to the introduction of the lower priced iPod shuffle in January 2005 and iPod mini pricing reductions in February 2005. From the introduction of the iPod in 2002 through 2005, the Company had sold approximately 28 million iPods. Net sales of other music related products and services increased $621 million or 223% during 2005 compared to 2004. The Company experienced strong growth in sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall iPod unit sales for 2005. The increased sales from the iTunes Store were primarily due to substantial growth of net sales in the U.S. and expansion in Europe, Canada, and Japan. Total Macintosh net sales increased $1.4 billion or 27% during 2005 compared to 2004. Unit sales of Macintosh systems increased 1.2 million units or 38% during 2005 compared to 2004. The increases in Macintosh net sales and unit sales related primarily to strong demand for the Companys desktop products, which was experienced in all of the Companys operating segments. The Company believes that the success of the iPod had a positive impact on Macintosh net sales by introducing new customers to the Companys other products. Desktop demand was stimulated in 2005 due to the iMac G5 and the introduction of the Mac mini in January 2005. Net sales and unit sales of desktop products increased 45% and 55%, respectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. Macintosh net sales and unit sales also included sales of the Companys portable products, which increased 11% and 21%, respectively, compared to 2004. Net sales per Macintosh unit sold decreased 7% on a year over year basis. The decrease was the result of changes in the overall unit mix towards relatively lower priced consumer products, specifically the impact of the Mac mini product, and desktop and portable price reductions. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the proportion of direct sales. Net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 18% during 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer accessories. Net sales of other hardware include AirPort cards and base stations, Xserve RAID storage, iSight digital video cameras, and third party hardware products. Net sales of software, service and other sales rose $270 million or 33% during 2005 compared to 2004. This growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales in APP extended service and support contracts, driven primarily by higher associated Macintosh computer sales. Additionally, the Company experienced increases in net sales of .Mac Internet service, professional and consumer applications, third party software, and Mac OS X that was primarily attributable to the release of version 10.4 Tiger in April 2005. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the 56 Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operated Apple owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. during 2006. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys operating segments may be found in Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Americas During 2006, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.7 billion, or 41%, compared to 2005. The main factors for this increase were significant increases in net sales of iPods, other music related products and services, Macintosh portable systems, and APP. Sales of iPods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with video playing capabilities in October 2005 and the iPod nano during September 2005. The increase in other music related products and services was due to increases in sales of Apple branded and third party iPod accessories and sales from the iTunes Store. The increase in sales of Macintosh portable systems in the Americas was due to strong sales of the Intel based MacBook and MacBook Pro during 2006. The overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline in net sales of desktops, displays, and Mac OS X. The decrease in desktop products and displays net sales reflects the overall shift in product mix toward portable Macintosh systems. Mac OS X sales decreased from 2005 since the Company has not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began shipping in April 2005. During 2006, the Americas segment represented approximately 48% of the Companys total net sales as compared to 47% in the same period of 2005. During 2006, U.S. education channel net sales and Macintosh unit sales increased by 13% and 11%, respectively, compared to 2005. Net sales from the higher education market grew 22% during 2006 compared to 2005 due to strong sales of Macintosh portable products and iPods. Net sales were relatively flat for K 12 due to continued budget constraints. During 2005, net sales in the Americas segment grew 64% or $2.6 billion compared to 2004. The increase in net sales during 2005 was primarily attributable to the significant year over year increase in iPod sales, sales of other music related products and services, and strong sales of desktop and portable Macintosh systems. This increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the Retail segment, which had 117 stores in the U.S. and Canada as of the end of 2005. Macintosh unit sales also increased by 30% in 2005 compared to 2004, driven primarily by strong sales of desktop systems largely attributable to strong sales from the updated iMac, which began shipping in September 2004, and the Mac mini, which was introduced in January 2005. During 2005 and 2004, the Americas segment represented approximately 47% and 49%, respectively, of the Companys total net sales and represented approximately 48% and 51%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. The Company experienced an increase in both U.S. education channel net sales and unit sales of 21% for 2005 compared to 2004. Strength in higher education sales related primarily to strong iMac and portable system shipments. This strength drove year over year growth in net sales of 32% for the higher education channel during 2005. Despite challenges in the K 12 market from continued budget constraints and competitive pressures, the Companys K 12 net sales grew year over year by 11% during 2005 due to increased iBook sales and 1:1 education sales. Europe Europe segment net sales increased $1.0 billion or 33% during 2006 compared to 2005. Consistent with the Americas segment, these increases were a result of strong growth in iPod sales, other music related products and services, and Macintosh portable systems. Sales of iPods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with video playing capabilities in October 2005 and the iPod nano during September 2005. The increase in other music related products and services was due to increases in sales of Apple branded and third party iPod accessories and sales from the iTunes Store. The increase in sales of portable systems in Europe was due to strong sales of the Intel based MacBook and MacBook Pro that were introduced during 2006. In addition, Europe also reported increased sales in APP related to the increase in Macintosh unit sales. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in desktop and 57 Mac OS X net sales during 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in desktop net sales was due to the shift in product mix toward portable Macintosh systems. Mac OS X sales have decreased from 2005 since the Company has not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began shipping in April 2005. During 2005, net sales in the Europe segment grew $1.3 billion or 71% from 2004. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing 47% in 2005 compared to 2004. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net sales of desktop products, iPod, other music related products and services, and software and service sales. Demand in Europe during 2005 was particularly strong for the Companys desktop computers, which experienced a year over year increase of 56% from 2004. Similar to the results of the Companys other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and software were strong in 2005. Japan Japans net sales increased $288 million or 31% during 2006 compared to 2005. The Japan segment experienced increased net sales in iPods, Macintosh portable products, and other music related products and services. Consistent with the Companys other segments, Japan experienced increases in sales of iPods due to the introduction of the iPod with video playing capabilities and the iPod nano in October and September of 2005, respectively. Japan also experienced strong sales of the Intel based MacBook and increased sales from the iTunes Store. These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of Macintosh desktop products, displays, and Mac OS X. The decreases in desktop products and displays reflect the overall shift in product mix toward portable Macintosh systems. Mac OS X sales have decreased from 2005 since the Company has not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began shipping in April 2005. Total Macintosh unit sales during 2006 remained relatively flat compared to 2005. The relatively flat growth in Macintosh unit sales is partially attributable to Japans overall slow consumer PC market growth. The Company is continuing to evaluate ways to improve its indirect and direct channel sales in Japan. Japans net sales and Macintosh unit sales were up 36% and 8%, respectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. Japan experienced increased net sales in desktop products, iPod, and other music related products and services. Desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 31% and 41%, respectively, and iPod sales increased by 220% during 2005 compared to 2004. The overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline in portable system net sales during 2005 compared to 2004, which the Company believes might have been attributable to a shift in sales from portables to the iMac G5 and Mac mini, and a shift to the Retail segment as a result of opening two additional stores in Japan during 2005. Retail The Company opened 41 new retail stores during 2006, including a total of 10 international stores in the U.K., Japan, and Canada, bringing the total number of open stores to 165 as of September 30, 2006. This compares to 124 open stores as of September 24, 2005 and 86 open stores as of September 25, 2004. The Retail segments net sales increased by 43% to $3.4 billion during 2006 compared to 2005. Retail segment Macintosh unit sales increased 45% during 2006 compared to 2005. With an average of 142 stores open during 2006, average revenue per store increased to $23.6 million compared to $22.4 million during 2005 and $15.6 million in 2004. The current year increase was primarily due to strong sales of Macintosh portable and desktop products, iPods, and other music related products and services. Sales of iPods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with video playing capabilities in October 2005 and the iPod nano during September 2005. The increase in other music related products and services was due to increased sales of Apple branded and third party iPod accessories. Macintosh portable and desktop sales increased due to strong sales of the Intel based MacBook, MacBook Pro, and iMac. As measured by the Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $198 million during 2006 as compared to operating income of $151 million during 2005 and 58 operating income of $39 million during 2004. This improvement was primarily attributable to the impact of opening new stores and the segments year over year increase in average revenue per store, which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation, and other fixed costs. Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment were $200 million in 2006, bringing the total capital expenditures since inception of the Retail segment to approximately $729 million. As of September 30, 2006, the Retail segment had approximately 5,787 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately $887 million. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close its retail stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Gross Margin Gross margin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): September 30, September 24, September 25, 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Net sales $ 19,315 $ 13,931 $ 8,279 Cost of sales 13,717 9,889 6,022 Gross margin $ 5,598 $ 4,042 $ 2,257 Gross margin percentage 29.0 % 29.0 % 27.3 % (1) See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Gross margin percentage of 29.0% in 2006 remained flat as compared to 2005. The Company experienced more favorable pricing on certain commodity components including LCD flat panel displays and DRAM memory and higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs, offset by an increase in lower margin iPod sales and other music related services. The Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margins of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries will be under pressure due to price competition. The Company expects gross margin percentage to decline sequentially in the first quarter of 2007 primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such as the iPod and content from the iTunes Store. The foregoing statements regarding the Companys expected gross margin percentage are forward looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margin percentage will be maintained or targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products, including iPods, will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Companys product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Companys ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a 59 risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Companys operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns. Gross margin percentage increased in 2005 to 29.0% of net sales from 27.3% of net sales in 2004. The Companys gross margin during 2005 increased due to more favorable pricing on certain commodity components including LCD flat panel displays and DRAM memory; an increase in higher margin software sales; a favorable shift in direct sales related primarily to the Companys retail and online stores; and higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs. These increases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower margin iPod sales. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): September 30, September 24, September 25, 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Research and development $ 712 $ 535 $ 491 Percentage of net sales 4 % 4 % 6 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 2,433 $ 1,864 $ 1,430 Percentage of net sales 13 % 13 % 17 % Restructuring costs $ $ $ 23 (1) See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Research and Development (R&D) Expenditures for R&D increased 33% or $177 million to $712 million in 2006 compared to $535 million in 2005. The increase was due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in the current year to support expanded R&D activities, an increase of $46 million in stock based compensation recognized as R&D expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and higher overall expenses due to the 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of 2006 to realign the Companys fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. In addition, during 2005, the Company capitalized approximately $29.7 million of costs associated with the development of Mac OS X Tiger. No software development costs were capitalized during 2006. Further information related to the Companys capitalization of software development costs may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Despite the increase in expenditures, R&D as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the significant increase in revenue. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Companys core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive. Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A) Expenditures for SG&A increased $569 million or 31% during 2006 compared to 2005. These increases are due primarily to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, an increase of $50 million in stock based compensation expense recognized as 60 SG&A expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary merit increases, and the expenses associated with the 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of 2006. Despite the increase in expenditures, SG&A as a percentage of total net sales in 2006 remained flat as compared to 2005. Expenditures for SG&A increased $434 million or 30% during 2005 compared to 2004. These increases are due primarily to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, and higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary merit increases. SG&A as a percentage of total net sales in 2005 was 13%, down from 17% in 2004, which is due to the increase in total net sales of 68% for the Company during 2005. Fiscal 2004 Restructuring Actions During 2004, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23.0 million, including approximately $14.0 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. The lease cancellations relate to vacating a leased sales facility as a result of a European workforce reduction during 2004. Of the $23.0 million charges, $21.3 million had been utilized by the end of 2006, with the remainder consisting of $1.7 million for lease cancellations. These actions resulted in the termination of 452 positions. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions): September 30, September 24, September 25, 2006 2005 2004 Gains on non current investments, net $ $ $ 4 Interest income $ 394 $ 183 $ 64 Interest expense (3 ) Other income (expense), net (29 ) (18 ) (8 ) Interest and other income, net $ 365 $ 165 $ 53 Total other income and expense $ 365 $ 165 $ 57 Gains and Losses on Non current Investments The Company previously held significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). The Company sold all of the remaining holdings in these non current investments in 2004 and 2003. Pretax gains recorded upon the sale of these non current investments were $4 million in 2004. Interest and Other Income, Net Total interest and other income, net increased $200 million or 121% to $365 million during 2006 compared to $165 million in 2005 and $53 million in 2004. These increases are attributable primarily to higher cash and short term investment balances and increasing investment yields resulting from higher market interest rates and the 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of 2006. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments increased to 4.58% in 2006 compared to the 2.70% and 1.38% rates earned during 2005 and 2004, respectively. The current year increase in other income was partially offset by higher foreign currency hedging expenses. Interest expense in 2004 consisted primarily of interest on the Companys $300 million aggregate principal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004. The unsecured notes 61 were sold at 99.925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting from the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized as of the notes maturity in February 2004. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2006 was approximately 29%. The Companys effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. In addition, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $20 million due to settlement of prior year tax audits in the U.S., and a net benefit of $20 million resulting from the dividend repatriation under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) and international tax planning strategies associated with the repatriation as further discussed below. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $739 million before being offset against certain deferred liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Companys balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operating losses that may not be realized. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA included a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that were repatriated, as defined in the AJCA, within a specified time frame. Among other requirements, dividends qualifying for the 85% deduction must be reinvested in the United States in certain qualified investments pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved by the CEO and Board of Directors. During 2006, the Company repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of foreign earnings. Of the earnings repatriated, $755 million is eligible for the reduced tax rate provided by the AJCA. Accordingly, the Company recorded a tax charge of $51 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA. In addition, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $71 million resulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognize deferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certain foreign subsidiaries. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has substantially completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company intends to contest certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. 62 Quarterly Financial Information The following tables set forth a summary of the Companys quarterly financial information for each of the four quarters in the years ended September 30, 2006 and September 24, 2005 (in millions, except share and per share amounts): 2006 Fourth Quarter Third Quarter Second Quarter First Quarter Net sales $ 4,837 $ 4,370 $ 4,359 $ 5,749 Cost of sales (1) 3,425 3,045 3,062 4,185 Gross margin 1,412 1,325 1,297 1,564 Operating expenses: Research and development (1) 179 175 176 182 Selling, general, and administrative (1) 625 584 592 632 Total operating expenses 804 759 768 814 Operating income 608 566 529 750 Other income and expense 113 95 76 81 Income before provision for income taxes 721 661 605 831 Provision for income taxes 179 189 195 266 Net income $ 542 $ 472 $ 410 $ 565 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 0.63 $ 0.55 $ 0.49 $ 0.68 Diluted $ 0.62 $ 0.54 $ 0.47 $ 0.65 Shares used in computing earnings per share (in thousands): Basic 854,187 851,375 840,910 830,781 Diluted 878,757 876,368 878,537 874,207 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense, which was allocated as follows: Cost of sales $ 5 $ 6 $ 5 $ 5 Research and development $ 13 $ 12 $ 13 $ 15 Selling, general, and administrative $ 22 $ 19 $ 24 $ 24 The net of tax impact of the stock based compensation adjustments in 2006, which amounted to $4 million, was recorded by the Company in its fourth quarter of 2006 and are described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. 63 2005 Fourth Quarter Third Quarter Second Quarter First Quarter As Restated (1) As Restated (1) As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Net sales $ 3,678 $ 3,520 $ 3,243 $ 3,490 Cost of sales (2) 2,643 2,476 2,275 2,495 Gross margin 1,035 1,044 968 995 Operating expenses: Research and development (2) 147 145 120 123 Selling, general, and administrative (2) 471 473 448 472 Total operating expenses 618 618 568 595 Operating income 417 426 400 400 Other income and expense 60 46 33 26 Income before provision for income taxes 477 472 433 426 Provision for income taxes 49 153 145 133 Net income $ 428 $ 319 $ 288 $ 293 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 0.52 $ 0.39 $ 0.36 $ 0.37 Diluted $ 0.49 $ 0.37 $ 0.34 $ 0.35 Shares used in computing earnings per share (in thousands): Basic 821,420 815,092 808,172 789,032 Diluted 866,483 860,803 857,568 838,805 (1) See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K.

SAB No. 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current years financial statements are materially misstated. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SAB No. 108, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by the Company beginning in the 66 first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 157, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by creating a framework for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions that they have taken or expect to take in a tax return. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FIN No. 48, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principal unless it is not practicable. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 154, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions): September 30, September 24, September 25, 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ 10,110 $ 8,261 $ 5,464 Accounts receivable, net $ 1,252 $ 895 $ 774 Inventory $ 270 $ 165 $ 101 Working capital $ 8,038 $ 6,813 $ 4,403 Days sales in accounts receivable (DSO) (a) 24 22 30 Days of supply in inventory (b) 7 6 5 Days payables outstanding (DPO) (c) 89 62 76 Annual operating cash flow $ 2,220 $ 2,535 $ 934 (1) See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. (a) DSO is based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period. (b) Days supply of inventory is based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period. (c) DPO is based on ending accounts payable and most recent quarterly cost of sales adjusted for the change in inventory. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had $10.11 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments, an increase of $1.85 billion over the same balances at the end of 2005. The principal 67 components of this increase were cash generated by operating activities of $2.22 billion, proceeds of $318 million from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $361 million, partially offset by cash used to purchase property, plant, and equipment of $657 million and repurchases of common stock of $355 million in conjunction with net share settlements on vested restricted stock and restricted stock units. Cash generated from operating activities includes the impact of the $1.25 billion prepayment for NAND flash memory components. The Companys short term investment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid investments. As of September 30, 2006, approximately $4.1 billion of the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. Capital Expenditures The Companys total capital expenditures were $657 million during 2006, consisting of $200 million for retail store facilities and equipment related to the Companys Retail segment, $263 million for real estate acquisitions for the Companys second corporate campus and for a new data center, and $194 million for corporate infrastructure, including information systems enhancements. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $675 million for capital expenditures during 2007, including approximately $360 million for expansion of the Companys Retail segment, approximately $50 million for real estate acquisitions including the Companys second corporate campus and its new data center, and approximately $265 million to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure. Stock Repurchase Plan In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. The Company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of $217 million under this plan and was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 30, 2006. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 30, 2006 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Companys balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions): Total Payments Due in Less Than 1 Year Payments Due in 1 3 Years Payments Due in 4 5 Years Payments Due in More Than 5 Years Operating Leases $ 1,154 $ 134 $ 268 $ 254 $ 498 Purchase Obligations 2,306 2,306 Asset Retirement Obligations 19 3 3 7 6 Other Obligations 39 29 10 Total $ 3,518 $ 2,472 $ 281 $ 261 $ 504 68 Lease Commitments As of September 30, 2006, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $1.2 billion, $887 million of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Lease terms on the Companys existing major facility operating leases range from 5 to 15 years. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had outstanding third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately $2.3 billion. During 2006, the Company entered into long term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006. These prepayments will be applied to inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. Asset Retirement Obligations The Companys asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September 30, 2006, the Company estimates that gross expected future cash flows of approximately $19 million will be required to fulfill these obligations. Other Obligations The Companys other obligations of approximately $39 million are primarily related to Internet and telecommunications services. Indemnifications The Company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 69 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate swap and option positions, both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys operating results and financial position. Interest Rate Risk While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries, the Companys interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. The Companys short term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment. A portion of the Companys cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Companys investment policy and to an objective market benchmark. The Companys internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance, allowing for differences in liquidity needs. The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio. The Company places its short term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months are classified as short term investments. As of September 30, 2006, approximately $921 million of the Companys short term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of September 24, 2005, $287 million of the Companys short term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management. The Company recognized net losses before taxes of $434,000 and $137,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and a net gain before taxes of $1 million in 2004 as a result of such sales. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 30, 2006, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $15.2 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 24, 2005, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $19.9 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. 70 Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Companys foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3,000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Companys foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of $9.2 million as of September 30, 2006 compared to a maximum one day loss of $10.0 million as of September 24, 2005. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 30, 2006 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Companys actual exposures and positions. 71
