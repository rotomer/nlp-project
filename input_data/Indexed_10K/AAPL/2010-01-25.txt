Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Form 10 K contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward looking statements can also be identified by words such as anticipates, expects, believes, plans, predicts, and similar terms. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Companys actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K, which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. All information presented herein is based on the Companys fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. The following information has been amended to reflect the retrospective adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) amended accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements (new accounting principles) on the Companys financial results, which is more fully described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part II, Item 6 and in Part II, Item 8 under Note 2, Retrospective Adoption of New Accounting Principles in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Executive Overview The Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, mobile communication devices, and portable digital music and video players and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Companys products and services include the Mac line of desktop and portable computers, iPhone, the iPod line of portable digital music and video players, Apple TV, Xserve, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, third party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third party wholesalers, retailers, and value added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third party Mac, iPhone and iPod compatible products, including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid sized business (SMB), education, enterprise, government, and creative markets. The Company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government and creative customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles and work environments. The Companys overall business strategy is to control the design and development of the hardware and software for all of its products, including the personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics devices. The Companys business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating system, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease of use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to the development and enhancement of innovative products and technologies. In conjunction with its strategy, the Company continues to build and host a robust platform for the discovery and delivery of third party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store. Most recently the Company launched the App Store that allows users to browse, search for, and purchase third party applications through either a Mac or Windows based computer or by wirelessly downloading directly to an iPhone or iPod touch. The Company also desires to support a community for the development of third party products that complement the Companys offerings through its developer programs. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well integrated digital lifestyle and productivity solutions. 4 Table of Contents The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac line of personal computers, mobile communications with iPhone, consumer electronics with its iPod product families, and distribution of third party digital content and applications through its online iTunes Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content and applications, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position in the markets where it competes. The Companys research and development spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of personal computers, its operating system, application software, iPhone and iPods; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The Company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness. The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on Mac computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high quality sales and after sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. The Company had 273 stores open as of September 26, 2009. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third party reseller locations, and the Apple Premium Reseller Program, through which independently run businesses focus on the Apple platform and provide a high level of customer service and product expertise. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac computers and other products over those of its competitors. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its direct sales force. The Company distributes iPhone in over 80 countries, through its direct channels, its cellular network carriers distribution channels and certain third party resellers. The Company has signed multi year agreements with various cellular network carriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for iPhones. These agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the U.S., Germany, Spain, Ireland and certain other countries. The Companys iPods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to provide broad access. iPods can be purchased in certain department stores, member only warehouse stores, large retail chains and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. 5 Table of Contents Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of marketable securities, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., Mac computers, iPhones, iPods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. For multi element arrangements that include tangible products containing software essential to the tangible products functionality and undelivered software elements relating to the tangible products essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third party evidence of selling price (TPE) and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP). For iPhone, the Company indicated it might from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. The Company has identified two deliverables generally contained in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of iPhone to receive on a when and if available basis future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the two deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the Companys ESPs. Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the 24 month estimated life of the related hardware. All product cost of sales, including estimated warranty costs, are generally recognized at the time of sale. Costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred. If the estimated life of the hardware product should change, the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade right will also change. For all periods presented, the Companys ESP for the software upgrade right included with each iPhone sold is $25. The Companys process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE involves managements judgment. The Companys process considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. The Company believes its customers, particularly 6 Table of Contents consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iPhone. This view is primarily based on the fact that upgrade rights do not obligate the Company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered in the future. Therefore, the Company has concluded if it were to sell upgrade rights on a standalone basis, such as those included with iPhone, the selling price would be relatively low. Key factors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs for iPhone upgrade rights include prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, the Companys historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when and if available), and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Companys ESP for software upgrades related to future iPhone sales could change in future periods. If the Companys ESP for the unspecified software upgrade rights related to iPhone had been $5 or 20% higher or lower, the Companys net sales for the year ended September 26, 2009 would have decreased or increased by $50 million as compared to the Companys net sales of $42.9 billion. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates, and other sales programs and volume based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Companys results of operations. Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities The Companys investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of investments impact the Companys net income only when such investments are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments amortized cost basis. The Companys assessment on whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired or not, could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment. 7 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company distributes its products through third party distributors, cellular network carriers, and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, or by requiring third party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit financing arrangements are directly between the third party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the ability to collect specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customers financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect its results of operations in the period the adjustments are made. Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write down for inventories of components and products, including third party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write downs, which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write downs were recorded. The Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. Warranty Costs The Company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual 8 Table of Contents product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the Companys results of operations. The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the softwares compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with GAAP, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, whereby the Company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10 K under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In managements opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 9 Table of Contents Net Sales Fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 spanned 52 weeks. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The following table summarizes net sales and Mac unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during the three years ended September 26, 2009 (in millions, except unit sales in thousands and per unit amounts): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Net Sales by Operating Segment: Americas net sales $ 18,887 15% $ 16,447 38% $ 11,907 Europe net sales 11,810 28% 9,233 69% 5,469 Japan net sales 2,279 32% 1,728 59% 1,084 Retail net sales 6,656 (9)% 7,292 67% 4,362 Other Segments net sales (a) 3,273 17% 2,791 59% 1,756 Total net sales $ 42,905 14% $ 37,491 53% $ 24,578 Mac Unit Sales by Operating Segment: Americas Mac unit sales 4,120 4% 3,980 32% 3,019 Europe Mac unit sales 2,840 13% 2,519 39% 1,816 Japan Mac unit sales 395 2% 389 29% 302 Retail Mac unit sales 2,115 4% 2,034 47% 1,386 Other Segments Mac unit sales (a) 926 17% 793 50% 528 Total Mac unit sales 10,396 7% 9,715 38% 7,051 Net Sales by Product: Desktops (b) $ 4,324 (23)% $ 5,622 40% $ 4,023 Portables (c) 9,535 9% 8,732 38% 6,313 Total Mac net sales 13,859 (3)% 14,354 39% 10,336 iPod 8,091 (12)% 9,153 10% 8,305 Other music related products and services (d) 4,036 21% 3,340 34% 2,496 iPhone and related products and services (e) 13,033 93% 6,742 NM 630 Peripherals and other hardware (f) 1,475 (13)% 1,694 30% 1,303 Software, service and other sales (g) 2,411 9% 2,208 46% 1,508 Total net sales $ 42,905 14% $ 37,491 53% $ 24,578 Unit Sales by Product: Desktops (b) 3,182 (14)% 3,712 37% 2,714 Portables (c) 7,214 20% 6,003 38% 4,337 Total Mac unit sales 10,396 7% 9,715 38% 7,051 Net sales per Mac unit sold (h) $ 1,333 (10)% $ 1,478 1% $ 1,466 iPod unit sales 54,132 (1)% 54,828 6% 51,630 Net sales per iPod unit sold (i) $ 149 (11)% $ 167 4% $ 161 iPhone units sold 20,731 78% 11,627 NM 1,389 (a) Other Segments include Asia Pacific and FileMaker.

NM Not Meaningful Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Net sales during 2009 increased $5.4 billion or 14% compared to 2008. Several factors contributed positively to these increases, including the following: iPhone revenue and net sales of related products and services amounted to $13.0 billion in 2009, an increase of $6.3 billion or 93% compared to 2008. The year over year iPhone revenue growth is largely attributable to the year over year increase in iPhone handset unit sales. iPhone handset unit sales totaled 20.7 million during 2009, which represents an increase of 9.1 million or 78% during 2009 compared to 2008. This growth is attributed primarily to expanded distribution and strong overall demand for iPhones. iPhone 3GS was released in the U.S. on June 19, 2009 and in many other countries over the remainder of 2009. iPhone revenue includes handset revenue recognized and revenue from sales of iPhone accessories and carrier agreements. Net sales of other music related products and services increased $696 million or 21% during 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was due predominantly to increased net sales of third party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, which experienced double digit growth in each of the Companys geographic segments during 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The Company believes this continued growth is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third party digital content and applications, continued growth in its customer base of iPod and iPhone customers, the expansion of third party audio and video content available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store, and the continued interest in and growth of the App Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content and applications offerings around the world. Partially offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, net sales during 2009 were negatively impacted by certain factors, including the following: Net sales of iPods decreased $1.1 billion or 12% during 2009 compared to 2008. iPod unit sales decreased slightly by 1% during 2009 compared to 2008. Net sales per iPod unit sold decreased 11% to $149 in 2009 compared to 2008, resulting from lower average selling prices across all of the iPod product lines, which were due primarily to price reductions taken with the introduction of new iPods in September 2009 and September 2008 and a stronger U.S. dollar, offset partially by a higher product mix of iPod touch. Mac net sales declined 3% during 2009 compared to 2008, although Mac unit sales increased by 7% over the same period. Net sales per Mac unit sold decreased by 10% during 2009 compared to 2008, due primarily to lower average selling prices across all Mac portable and desktop systems and a stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales of Macs accounted for 32% of the Companys total net sales for 2009. During 2009, Mac portable systems net sales and unit sales increased by 9% and 20%, respectively, compared to 2008. This growth was driven by strong demand for MacBook Pro, which was updated in June 2009 and October 2008, and experienced double digit net sales and unit growth in each of the Companys reportable operating segments compared to the same period in 2008. The Company also had a higher product mix of portable systems, which is consistent with the overall market trends. However, net sales and unit sales of the Companys Mac desktop systems decreased by 23% and 14%, 11 Table of Contents respectively, during 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in net sales of Mac desktop systems was due mainly to a shift in product mix towards lower priced desktops, lower average selling prices across all Mac desktop systems and a stronger U.S. dollar. Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 Net sales during 2008 increased $12.9 billion or 53% from 2007. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $6.7 billion for 2008, with iPhone handset unit sales totaling 11.6 million. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $630 million in 2007, which represented sales for slightly more than one fiscal quarter. iPhone revenue includes handset revenue recognized and revenue from sales of iPhone accessories and carrier agreements. Mac net sales increased $4.0 billion or 39% during 2008 compared to 2007, while Mac unit sales increased by 2.7 million units or 38%. Net sales related to the Companys Mac shipments accounted for 38% of the Companys total net revenue in 2008. Higher Mac unit sales, which contributed to the increases in net sales, were driven by higher sales of all of the Companys Mac portable products as well as the popularity of the iMac, which experienced strong growth in net sales and unit sales in all of the Companys reportable segments. Unit sales of the Companys Mac portable products accounted for 62% of the Companys personal computer shipments in both 2008 and 2007. Net sales and unit sales of the Companys Mac portable products both increased by 38% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was attributable to strong demand for all the Mac portable products, particularly the MacBook, which had double digit growth in all of the Companys operating segments, and the addition of the MacBook Air, which was introduced to the Companys Mac portable product line in January 2008. Growth of the Companys Mac desktop systems was also strong, with increased net sales and unit sales of 40% and 37%, respectively, during 2008 due primarily to strong sales of the iMac in all of the Companys operating segments. Net sales of iPods increased $848 million or 10% during 2008 compared to 2007 and unit sales of iPods increased 6% compared to 2007. The iPod unit growth was due to strong demand for the iPod touch, and to a lesser extent, higher unit sales of the iPod shuffle due to a price reduction in February 2008. iPod net sales grew faster than iPod unit sales due to higher average selling prices caused by a shift in overall iPod product mix to the higher priced iPod touch. Net sales of other music related products and services increased $844 million or 34% during 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to significantly increased net sales from the iTunes Store in each of the Companys geographic segments. The Company believes this success is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third party digital content, the expansion of third party audio and video content available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store, and the launch of the iTunes App Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content offerings around the world. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan and Retail. The Americas, Europe and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable geographic operating segment and the Retail operating segment provide similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys operating segments may be found in Note 10, Segment Information and Geographic Data in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Under the historical subscription accounting methodology no single customer accounted for more than 10% of 12 Table of Contents net sales in 2009; under the new accounting principles that were retrospectively adopted in the first quarter of 2010, however, one of the Companys customers represented 11% of net sales in 2009. There was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2008 or 2007 under the historical subscription accounting methodology or the new accounting principles. Americas During 2009, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.4 billion or 15% compared to 2008. The increase in net sales during 2009 was attributable to the significant year over year increase in iPhone revenue, higher sales of third party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, and increased sales of Mac portable systems, which were partially offset by a decrease in sales of Mac desktop systems and iPods. Americas Mac net sales decreased 6% due primarily to lower average selling prices, while Mac unit sales increased by 4% on a year over year basis. The increase in Mac unit sales was due primarily to strong demand for the MacBook Pro, which was updated in June 2009 and October 2008. The Americas segment represented approximately 44% of the Companys total net sales in both 2009 and 2008. During 2008, net sales in the Americas segment increased $4.5 billion or 38% compared to 2007. The primary drivers of this growth were the significant year over year increase in sales of iPhone, iPod touch, Mac portable systems, and content from the iTunes Store. The Company began shipping iPhone in June 2007 and the growth in iPhone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iPhone shipments as well as stronger demand for iPhones in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in Mac net sales of $1.4 billion or 31% and Mac unit sales of 961 million or 32% is attributable to growth in sales of all of the Mac portable systems, particularly the MacBook, and higher sales of the iMac. Net sales of iPods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced iPods, particularly the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. In 2008, the Americas segment represented 44% of the Companys total net sales as compared to 48% in 2007. Europe During 2009, net sales in Europe increased $2.6 billion or 28% compared to 2008. The increase in net sales was due mainly to increased iPhone revenue and strong sales of Mac portable systems, offset partially by lower net sales of Mac desktop systems, iPods, and a stronger U.S. dollar. Mac unit sales increased 13% in 2009 compared to 2008, which was driven primarily by increased sales of Mac portable systems, particularly MacBook Pro, while total Mac net sales declined as a result of lower average selling prices across all Mac products. Although iPod net sales decreased in Europe year over year as a result of lower average selling prices, iPod unit sales increased due to iPod touch and market share increases. The Europe segment represented 28% and 25% of total net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Europes net sales increased $3.8 billion or 69% during 2008 compared to 2007. The main drivers of this growth were strong sales of iPhone, Mac portable systems and iMac, and increased sales from the iTunes Store. Also contributing to the increase in net sales were higher iPod net sales due primarily to the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to stronger demand for the MacBook Pro and the MacBook, both updated in February 2008, as well as sales of the MacBook Air, introduced in January 2008. Mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the iMac, which was updated in April 2008. The Europe segment represented 25% and 22% of total net sales in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Japan Japans net sales increased $551 million or 32% in 2009 compared to 2008. The key contributors to this growth were increased iPhone revenue, stronger demand for certain Mac portable systems and iPods, and strength in the Japanese Yen, partially offset by decreased sales of Mac desktop systems. Net sales and unit sales of Mac portable systems increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by stronger demand for MacBook Pro, which was updated in June 2009 and October 2008. Net sales and unit sales of iPods increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven by strong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. 13 Table of Contents Japan net sales increased $644 million or 59% in 2008 compared to 2007. The primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of iPhones, iPods, iMac, Mac portable systems, and strong sales from the iTunes Store. Net sales, unit sales and the average selling price of iPods increased during 2008 compared to 2007, driven by strong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. Additionally, Mac net sales and unit sales grew 42% and 29%, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in sales of iMac and Mac portable systems, particularly MacBook, as well as the introduction of MacBook Air in January 2008. Retail Retail net sales decreased $636 million or 9% during 2009 compared to 2008. The decline in net sales was driven largely by a decrease in net sales of iPhones, iPods and Mac desktop systems, offset partially by strong demand for Mac portable systems. The Company opened 26 new retail stores during 2009, including a total of 14 international stores, ending the year with 273 stores open. This compares to 247 stores open as of September 27, 2008 and 197 open stores as of September 29, 2007. The year over year decline in Retail net sales is attributable to continued third party channel expansion, particularly in the U.S. where most of the Companys stores are located, and also reflects the challenging consumer spending environment. With an average of 254 stores and 211 stores opened during 2009 and 2008, respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $26.2 million for 2009 from $34.6 million in 2008. The Retail segments net sales grew by $2.9 billion or 67% during 2008 compared to 2007, due in large part to strong demand for the iPhone, increased sales of Mac portable and desktop systems, increased sales of iPod touch and new store openings. The Company opened 50 new retail stores during 2008, bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of September 27, 2008. This compares to 197 open stores as of September 29, 2007. With an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $34.6 million for 2008 from $24.5 million in 2007. As measured by the Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $1.7 billion during 2009 and 2008, and $876 million during 2007. Despite the year over year decline in Retail net sales, the Retail segments operating income was flat at $1.7 billion in 2009 and 2008 due primarily to a higher gross margin percentage consistent with that experienced by the overall company. The Retail segments operating income increased by $785 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the significant Retail net sales growth of 67% as compared to 2007. Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment were $369 million in 2009, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the Retail segment to $1.8 billion. As of September 26, 2009, the Retail segment had approximately 16,500 full time equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $1.5 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results. Other Segments The Companys Other Segments, which consist of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced an increase in net sales of $482 million, or 17%, during 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting strong growth in sales of iPhone and Mac portable systems offset partially by a decline in sales related to iPods and Mac desktop systems in the Asia Pacific region, as well as a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar and other Asian currencies. Mac net sales and unit sales grew in the Asia Pacific region by 4% and 17%, respectively, due to increased sales of the MacBook Pro. 14 Table of Contents The Companys Other Segments experienced an increase in net sales of $1.0 billion, or 59% during 2008 as compared to 2007. These increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of iPhone, Mac portable systems, iPods and iMac in the Companys Asia Pacific region. Sales from the iTunes Store in the Companys Asia Pacific region grew 109% compared to 2007. Gross Margin Gross margin for the three years ended September 26, 2009, are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 42,905 $ 37,491 $ 24,578 Cost of sales 25,683 24,294 16,426 Gross margin $ 17,222 $ 13,197 $ 8,152 Gross margin percentage 40.1% 35.2% 33.2% The gross margin percentage in 2009 was 40.1% compared to 35.2% in 2008. The primary contributors of the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 were a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins and lower commodity and other product costs, which were partially offset by product price reductions. The gross margin percentage in 2008 was 35.2% compared to 33.2% in 2007. The primary contributors of the increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 were a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins and lower commodity costs, which were partially offset by higher other product costs. In 2007, gross margin was impacted by higher than expected costs associated with the initial iPhone product launch. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended September 26, 2009, are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): 2009 2008 2007 Research and development $ 1,333 $ 1,109 $ 782 Percentage of net sales 3.1% 3.0% 3.2% Selling, general and administrative $ 4,149 $ 3,761 $ 2,963 Percentage of net sales 9.7% 10.0% 12.1% Research and Development (R&D) R&D expenditures increased 20% or $224 million to $1.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. These increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount in the current year to support expanded R&D activities and higher stock based compensation expenses. In addition, $71 million of software development costs were capitalized related to Mac OS X Snow Leopard and excluded from R&D expense during 2009, compared to $11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008. Although total R&D expense increased 20% during 2009, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 14% increase in revenue in 2009. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Companys core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive. Expenditures for R&D increased 42% or $327 million to $1.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2008 and higher stock based compensation expenses. In 2008, $11 million of software development costs were capitalized related to Mac OS X Snow Leopard and excluded 15 Table of Contents from R&D expense, while R&D expense for 2007 excluded $75 million of capitalized software development costs related to Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone software. Although total R&D expense increased 42% during 2008, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 53% increase in revenue during 2008. Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SG&A) SG&A expenditures increased $388 million or 10% to $4.1 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. These increases are due primarily to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, higher stock based compensation expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising. Expenditures for SG&A increased $798 million or 27% to $3.8 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases are due primarily to higher stock based compensation expenses, higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year over year increase in total net sales and the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets. In addition, the Company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for the three years ended September 26, 2009, are as follows (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 407 $ 653 $ 647 Other income (expense), net (81 ) (33 ) (48 ) Total other income and expense $ 326 $ 620 $ 599 Total other income and expense decreased $294 million or 47% to $326 million during 2009 compared to $620 million and $599 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007, partially offset by the Companys higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.43%, 3.44% and 5.27% during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. The Companys investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of $16 million and $121 million as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively, which were offset by gross unrealized gains of $73 million and $4 million as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. The net unrealized gains as of September 26, 2009 and the net unrealized losses as of September 27, 2008 related primarily to long term marketable securities. The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Companys marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically widening credit spreads. The Company does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not the Company will be required to sell, any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Accordingly, no material declines in fair value were recognized in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to such sales. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates were 32%, 32% and 30% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Companys effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. 16 Table of Contents As of September 26, 2009, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $1.9 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities of $2.8 billion for presentation on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Recent Accounting Pronouncements During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements), which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued supplemental guidance that delays the effective date of this new fair value accounting standard to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2010. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of this accounting standard, management does not currently believe adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operating results. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (formerly referenced as SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. This new accounting standard also establishes principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, as well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination. In April 2009, the FASB amended this new accounting standard to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. This new business combination accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2010 and will apply prospectively to any business combinations completed on or after that date. The effect of adoption of this new accounting pronouncement on the Companys financial condition or operating results will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption. 17 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three years ended September 26, 2009 (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 33,992 $ 24,490 $ 15,386 Accounts receivable, net $ 3,361 $ 2,422 $ 1,637 Inventories $ 455 $ 509 $ 346 Working capital $ 20,049 $ 18,645 $ 12,595 Annual operating cash flow $ 10,159 $ 9,596 $ 5,470 As of September 26, 2009, the Company had $34.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $9.5 billion from September 27, 2008. The principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $10.2 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property, plant and equipment of $1.1 billion. The Companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities, generally with a minimum rating of single A or equivalent. As of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, $17.4 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar denominated holdings. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. Capital Assets The Companys cash payments for capital asset purchases were $1.1 billion during 2009, consisting of $369 million for retail store facilities and $775 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $1.9 billion for capital asset purchases during 2010, including approximately $400 million for Retail facilities and approximately $1.5 billion for corporate facilities, infrastructure, and product tooling and manufacturing process equipment. Historically the Company has opened between 25 and 50 new retail stores per year. During 2010, the Company expects to open a number of new stores near the upper end of this range, over half of which are expected to be located outside of the U.S. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. 18 Table of Contents The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 26, 2009 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as current liabilities (in millions): Total PaymentsDue inLessThan1 Year PaymentsDue in1 3 Years PaymentsDue in4 5 Years PaymentsDue inMoreThan5 Years Operating leases $ 1,922 $ 222 $ 462 $ 413 $ 825 Purchase obligations 4,581 4,581 Asset retirement obligations 32 4 8 4 16 Other obligations 356 175 129 52 Total $ 6,891 $ 4,982 $ 599 $ 469 $ 841 Lease Commitments As of September 26, 2009, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. The Companys major facility leases are generally for terms of one to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of one to five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of five to 20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi year renewal options. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. As of September 26, 2009, the Company had outstanding off balance sheet third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $4.6 billion. The Company has entered into prepaid long term supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. During the first quarter of 2009, a long term supply agreement with Intel Corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of $167 million was repaid to the Company. During the second and fourth quarters of 2009, the Company made a prepayment of $500 million to LG Display for the purchase of LCD panels and a prepayment of $500 million to Toshiba to purchase NAND flash memory, respectively. As of September 26, 2009, the Company had a total of $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding. Asset Retirement Obligations The Companys asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September 26, 2009, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $32 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. Other Obligations Other outstanding obligations were $356 million as of September 26, 2009, which related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. 19 Table of Contents As of September 26, 2009, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $971 million and an additional $291 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12 months. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. Indemnifications The Company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 26, 2009 or September 27, 2008. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the Companys financial condition or operating results. 20 Table of Contents
