ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained herein. The Company AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the Company) is a leading national wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products and related healthcare services and solutions with approximately $40 billion in annual operating revenue. The Company was formed in connection with the merger of AmeriSource Health Corporation (AmeriSource) and Bergen Brunswig Corporation (Bergen), which was consummated on August 29, 2001 (the Merger). The Company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers. The Companys operating segments have been aggregated into two reportable segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica. The Pharmaceutical Distribution segment includes AmerisourceBergen Drug Company (ABDC) and AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG). ABDC includes the full service pharmaceutical distribution facilities, American Health Packaging, AutoMed Technologies, Inc. and other healthcare related businesses. ABDC sells pharmaceuticals, over the counter medicines, health and beauty aids, and other health related products to hospitals, managed care facilities, and independent and chain retail pharmacies. American Health Packaging packages oral solid medications for nearly any need in virtually all settings of patient care. ABDC also provides promotional, inventory management, pharmacy automation and information services to its customers. ABSG sells specialty pharmaceutical products and services to physicians, clinics and other providers in the oncology, nephrology, plasma and vaccines sectors. ABSG also provides third party logistics and reimbursement consulting services to healthcare product manufacturers. The PharMerica segment consists solely of the Companys PharMerica operations. PharMerica provides institutional pharmacy products and services to patients in long term care and alternate site settings, including skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and residential living communities. It also provides mail order and on line pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers compensation programs, and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors. Impact of the Merger The Merger was accounted for as an acquisition of Bergen under the purchase method of accounting using the guidelines for business combinations issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Under the purchase method of accounting, the estimated cost of approximately $2.4 billion to acquire Bergen, including transaction costs, was allocated to its underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. The $2.3 billion excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and intangible assets. Comparative Pro Forma Information for Fiscal 2001 The Companys fiscal 2001 results include a full year of AmeriSources results and approximately one month of Bergens results. In order to enhance comparability to the fiscal 2002 results, we have included pro forma information for fiscal 2001 results of operations. For purposes of this discussion, pro forma refers to the combined results of AmeriSource and Bergen for fiscal 2001 and are not intended to be consolidated financial statements of AmerisourceBergen prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and do not represent the consolidated results as if the Merger had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2001. In addition, they are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which might have occurred had the operations and management of AmeriSource and Bergen been combined at the beginning of fiscal 2001. The following information also includes the results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2001 on a pro forma basis by reportable segment. 14 Table of Contents To further improve the comparability between fiscal years, the pro forma combined information for the year ended September 30, 2001 excludes amortization of goodwill (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and reflects the full allocation of Bergens former Corporate segment to the Companys Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments. Such pro forma information and the related discussion is limited to the line items comprising operating income. Due to the changes in the Companys debt structure which occurred in connection with the Merger, pro forma combined interest expense for fiscal 2001 would not be directly comparable to the Companys fiscal 2002 interest expense.

This increase is primarily due to increased operating revenue in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment as a result of the Merger. Operating revenue increased 16% from $34.6 billion in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. This increase is primarily due to the 16% increase in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. As a result of the Merger, bulk deliveries increased to $5.0 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 compared to $368.7 million in the prior fiscal year. Revenue from bulk deliveries increased 10% versus $4.5 billion in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. Due to the insignificant service fees generated from these bulk deliveries, fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins. However, revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact to the Companys cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to us and the payments by us to our suppliers. Substantially all of the Companys bulk deliveries were made to Merck Medco Managed Care LLC. Gross profit of $2,024.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects an increase of 189% from $700.1 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and an increase of 8% from $1,880.7 million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 was 5.03%, as compared to prior year percentages of 4.42% on a historical basis and 5.44% on a pro forma combined basis. The increase in the gross profit percentage from prior fiscal year historical results was primarily due to the inclusion of PharMerica in the current year. PharMerica, due to the nature of its prescription fulfillment business, has significantly higher gross margins and operating expense ratios than the Companys Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year pro forma combined percentage reflects declines in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization (DSAD&A) of $1,281.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects an increase of 206% compared to $419.4 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and an increase of 2% compared to $1,260.1 million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. As a percentage of operating revenue, DSAD&A in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 was 3.19%, as compared to prior fiscal year percentages of 2.65% on a historical basis and 3.64% on a pro forma combined basis. The increases in the DSAD&A percentage from the prior fiscal year historical results were primarily due to the inclusion of PharMerica in the current year, as explained above. The decrease in the DSAD&A percentage from the prior fiscal year pro forma combined ratio reflects improvements in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to customer mix changes, operational efficiencies and benefits from the merger integration effort. In connection with the Merger, the Company has developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicate administrative functions, which are expected to result in synergies of approximately $150 million annually by the end of the third year following the Merger. The Companys plan is to have a distribution facility network consisting of 30 facilities in the next four to five years. This will be accomplished by building six new facilities, expanding seven facilities, and closing 27 facilities. During fiscal 2002, the Company closed seven distribution facilities and is planning to close an additional six facilities in fiscal 2003. In September 2001, the Company announced plans to close seven distribution facilities in fiscal 2002, consisting of six former AmeriSource facilities and one former Bergen facility. A charge of $10.9 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 related to the AmeriSource facilities, and included $6.2 million of severance for approximately 260 warehouse and administrative personnel to be terminated, $2.3 million in lease and contract cancellations, and $2.4 million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed. Approximately $0.2 million of costs related to the Bergen facility were included in the Merger purchase price allocation. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, the Company announced further integration initiatives relating to the closure of Bergens repackaging facility and the elimination of certain Bergen administrative functions, including the closure of a related office facility. The cost of these initiatives of approximately $19.2 million, which included $15.8 million of severance for approximately 310 employees to be terminated, $1.6 million for lease cancellation costs, and $1.8 million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed, resulted in additional goodwill being recorded during fiscal 2002. 16 Table of Contents During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, seven distribution facilities and the repackaging facility were closed, and 355 employees were terminated. The Company paid a total of $15.6 million for employee severance and lease and contract cancellation costs with respect to its integration initiatives during fiscal 2002. Remaining unpaid amounts of $9.1 million for employee severance and lease obligations are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2002. Severance for some employees will be paid over periods of up to eighteen months after their respective termination dates. In September 2002, the Company announced the first of its six facility closures planned for fiscal 2003. In December 2002, the Company announced the second and third of the planned facility closures. Employee severance and lease cancellation costs related to the fiscal 2003 facility closures will be recognized in accordance with the new provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which the Company elected to adopt early in September 2002. Employee severance costs will generally be expensed during the employee service period and lease cancellation and other costs will generally be expensed when the Company enters into a contractual obligation. The Company expects to incur charges of approximately $10 million to $12 million relating to these efforts in fiscal 2003. Additional amounts for integration initiatives will be recognized in subsequent periods as facilities to be consolidated are identified and specific plans are approved and announced. In connection with the Merger, the Company expensed merger costs in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 of $24.2 million, consisting primarily of integration consulting fees of $16.6 million. The merger costs also include a $2.1 million increase to the Companys fourth quarter fiscal 2001 charge of $6.5 million relating to the accelerated vesting of AmeriSource stock options. Total merger costs in fiscal 2001 amounted to $13.1 million, primarily consisting of consulting fees and the accelerated stock option vesting charge. Additional merger costs, including integration and employee retention costs, will be charged to expense in subsequent periods when incurred. Operating income of $718.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects an increase of 177% from $259.4 million in the prior fiscal year. Special items had the effect of reducing the Companys operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 and 2001 by $24.2 million and $21.3 million, respectively. The Companys operating income as a percentage of operating revenue was 1.79% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, as compared to prior year percentages of 1.64% on a historical basis and 1.73% on a pro forma combined basis. The improvements are due to the aforementioned DSAD&A expense percentage reductions more than offsetting the reductions in gross margin. Equity in losses of affiliates and other was $5.6 million and $10.9 million in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, respectively. The fiscal 2002 amount principally reflects an impairment of the Companys investment in a healthcare technology company. The majority of the fiscal 2001 amount represents the impact of the Companys investment in Health Nexus, LLC, which was accounted for on the equity method. The Companys percentage ownership in the successor to Health Nexus, LLC fell below 20% in November 2001, and this investment is now accounted for using the cost method. Interest expense, which includes the distributions on preferred securities of a subsidiary trust, increased 194% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 to $140.7 million compared to $47.9 million in the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of the Merger. Average borrowings under the Companys debt facilities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 were $2.2 billion as compared to average borrowings of $746 million in the prior fiscal year. Average borrowing rates under the Companys variable rate debt facilities decreased to 3.5% in the current fiscal year from 6.2% in the prior fiscal year, due to lower market interest rates. Income tax expense of $227.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects an effective tax rate of 39.7% versus 38.3% in the prior fiscal year. The tax rate for fiscal 2002 was higher than the prior fiscal years tax rate as a result of the Merger. Net income of $344.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects an increase of 179% from $123.8 million in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share of $3.16 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects a 50% increase as compared to $2.10 per share in the prior fiscal year. Special items had the effect of reducing net income and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 by $14.6 million and $0.13, respectively and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 by $13.1 million and $0.21, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects the full year impact of the shares issued to effect the Merger. 17 Table of Contents Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue of $39.5 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 151% from $15.8 billion in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased 16% from $34.0 billion in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, 53% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 47% was from retail customers; this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 53% institutional and 47% retail on a historical basis and 52% institutional and 48% retail on a pro forma combined basis. In comparison with prior fiscal year pro forma combined results, sales to institutional customers increased by 19% primarily due to higher revenues from mail order facilities, ABSGs specialty pharmaceutical business and alternate site facilities. Sales to retail customers increased 14% over the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis, principally due to higher revenues from regional drug store chains, including the pharmacy departments of supermarkets. This segments growth largely reflects national industry economic conditions, including increases in prescription drug usage and higher pharmaceutical prices. Operating revenue increased 18% in the first half of the year and 14% in the second half of the year when compared to the same periods in the prior year on a pro forma combined basis as the Company reached the April 2002 anniversary date of the addition of a large mail order customer. Future operating revenue growth may be impacted by customer consolidation and competition within the industry, as well as by industry growth rates. Industry growth rates, as estimated by IMS Healthcare, Inc., are expected to be between 11% and 14% over the next four years, reflecting the impact of $35 billion of brand name drug patent expirations expected between 2001 and 2005 and a slowdown in the introduction of significant new drugs in 2003. Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit of $1,530.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 132% from $660.4 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased 9% from $1,405.0 million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 was 3.87%, as compared to prior fiscal year percentages of 4.19% on a historical basis and 4.13% on a pro forma combined basis. The year to year declines reflect the net impact of a number of factors, including the change in customer mix to a higher percentage of large institutional, mail order and chain accounts, and the continuing competitive pricing environment, offset, in part, by higher buy side margins than in the prior year. Downward pressures on sell side gross profit margin are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that increases in the buy side component of the gross margin, including benefits derived from manufacturer price increases and negotiated deals, will be available in the future to fully or partially offset the anticipated decline. The Companys cost of goods sold includes a last in, first out (LIFO) provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating expenses of $871.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 126% from $386.2 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased 2% from $853.1 million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 were 2.20%, as compared to prior year percentages of 2.45% on a historical basis and 2.51% on a pro forma combined basis. These decreases in expense percentages reflect the changing customer mix described above, efficiencies of scale, the elimination of redundant costs through the merger integration process and the continued emphasis on productivity throughout the Companys distribution network. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income of $659.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 140% from $274.2 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased 19% from $551.8 million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income was 1.67% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, as compared to prior year percentages of 1.74% on a historical basis, and 1.62% on a pro forma combined basis. The improvement over the prior year pro forma combined percentage was due to a reduction in the operating expense ratio, which was greater than the reduction in gross profit margin. The reduction of the operating expense ratio was partially due to the Companys ability to capture synergy cost savings from the Merger. While management historically has been able to lower expense ratios and expects to continue to do so, there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future, or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible declines in gross margins. Additionally, there can be no assurance that merger integration efforts will proceed as planned and result in the desired synergies. 18 Table of Contents PharMerica Segment The PharMerica segment was acquired in connection with the Merger and the historical amounts for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 are comprised of only one month of PharMericas operating results. Accordingly, the discussion below focuses all comparisons with the prior year on a pro forma combined basis. PharMericas operating revenue increased 9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 to $1.48 billion compared to $1.35 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase is principally attributable to growth in PharMericas workers compensation business, which has grown at a faster rate than its long term care business. PharMericas gross profit of $494.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 4% from gross profit of $475.8 million in the prior fiscal year. PharMericas gross profit margin declined to 33.49% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 from 35.24% in the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily the result of a change in the sales mix, with a greater proportion of PharMericas current year revenues coming from its workers compensation business, which has lower gross profit margins and lower operating expenses than its long term care business. In addition, industry competitive pressures continue to adversely affect gross profit margins. PharMericas operating expenses of $410.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 1% from operating expenses of $406.9 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses were reduced to 27.83% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 from 30.14% in the prior fiscal year. The percentage reduction is due to several factors, including the aforementioned shift in customer mix towards the workers compensation business, consolidation of technology platforms, the consolidation or sale of several pharmacies, and a reduction in bad debt expense. PharMericas operating income of $83.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 21% compared to operating income of $68.9 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income was 5.66% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, an increase of 56 basis points from 5.10% in the prior fiscal year. The year to year improvement in the operating income percentage was due to the aforementioned reductions in the operating expense ratio, which were greater than the reductions in gross profit margin. Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to PharMerica. AmerisourceBergen Drug Company is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to PharMerica. Year ended September 30, 2001 compared with Year ended September 30, 2000 The accompanying historical consolidated statement of operations and cash flows for fiscal 2000 and the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2000, reflect only the results of AmeriSource, as predecessor to the Company. As a result, the Companys historical operating results and cash flows for fiscal 2000 and the Companys financial position as of September 30, 2000 are not comparable to fiscal 2001 because of the Merger. Fiscal 2001 results include a full year of AmeriSource and approximately one month of Bergens results. Accordingly, in order to enhance comparability, the following discussion of results of operations includes pro forma revenue information. For purposes of this discussion, pro forma refers to the combined results of AmeriSource and Bergen in each respective fiscal year. Consolidated Results Operating revenue, which excludes bulk deliveries, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 increased 36% to $15.8 billion from $11.6 billion in the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased operating revenue in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. Excluding the revenue impact from the Merger, operating revenue increased 20% for the full fiscal year. On a pro forma combined basis operating revenue increased 14% versus the prior year. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. As a result of the Merger, bulk deliveries increased to $368.7 million in fiscal 2001 19 Table of Contents from $35.0 million in fiscal 2000. Excluding the impact from the Merger, bulk deliveries would have decreased to $1.1 million for fiscal 2001. On a pro forma combined basis, revenue from bulk deliveries of $4.5 billion in fiscal 2001 increased 7% versus the prior year. Due to the insignificant service fees generated from these bulk deliveries, fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins. Gross profit of $700.1 million in fiscal 2001 increased by 35% as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of operating revenue, the gross profit in fiscal 2001 was 4.42% as compared to 4.48% in the prior year. The decline in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of a 29 basis point decrease in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, which was offset, in part, by the impact of the inclusion of one month of PharMericas results. PharMerica, due to the nature of its prescription fulfillment business, has significantly higher gross margins and operating expense ratios than the Companys Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. Excluding the impact of the Merger, gross profit increased 12% for the full fiscal year, and as a percentage of operating revenue was 4.16% in fiscal 2001 as compared to 4.48% in the prior year. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization increased by $100.9 million or 32% in fiscal 2001 as compared to the prior year, and decreased as a percentage of operating revenue to 2.65% in fiscal 2001 from 2.74% in fiscal 2000 due to a 29 basis point decrease in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment ratio offset in part by the inclusion of one month of PharMerica results. Excluding the impact of the Merger, distribution, selling and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization increased 7% for the full fiscal year, and decreased as a percentage of operating revenue to 2.44% in fiscal 2001 from 2.74% in fiscal 2000. In connection with the Merger, the Company has developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicate administrative functions, which are expected to result in synergies of approximately $150 million annually at the end of the third year following the Merger. The Company intends to reduce the number of distribution facilities from 51 at September 30, 2001, to approximately 30 over the next four to five years and announced plans to close seven facilities in fiscal 2002. A charge of $10.9 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 related to these plans, and included $6.2 million of severance for approximately 260 warehouse and administrative personnel to be terminated, $2.3 million in lease cancellations, and $2.4 million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed. Accrued expenses of $7.1 million related to this charge are included in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2001. In connection with its acquisition of Bergen, the Company incurred merger costs of $13.1 million in fiscal 2001, consisting primarily of consulting fees of $5.6 million and a $6.5 million charge for the accelerated vesting of AmeriSource stock options. The Company is subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations at one of its former distribution centers that may require the Company to make remediation efforts. In fiscal 1994, the Company accrued $4.1 million to cover future consulting, legal, remediation and ongoing monitoring costs. During fiscal 2001, environmental reserves of $2.7 million were reversed into income based on a new engineering analysis prepared by outside consultants that was completed in September 2001. The remaining liability of $1.0 million at September 30, 2001, is reflected in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. This accrued liability represents the current estimate of the extent of contamination and choice of remedy based on existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. However, changes in remediation standards, improvements in cleanup technology and discovery of additional information concerning the site could affect the actual liability in the future. During fiscal 2000, severance accruals of $1.1 million relating to the fiscal 1999 facility consolidation and 1998 restructuring efforts were reversed into income after employees expected to be severed either left the Company before receiving their benefits or were retained in other positions within the Company. Operating income of $259.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2001 increased by 28% from the prior year, primarily due to the 36% increase in operating income from the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and the inclusion of one month of PharMericas results due to the Merger, offset in part by the merger costs and employee severance and facility consolidation costs. Equity in losses of affiliates and other were $10.9 million in fiscal 2001 and $0.6 million in fiscal 2000. These results primarily reflect the full year impact of the Companys equity investment in HealthNexis, LLC that was accounted for on the equity method and the write down of the Companys investment in a technology company. HealthNexis, LLC subsequently merged with the Global Health Exchange LLC in November 2001. 20 Table of Contents Interest expense of $47.9 million in fiscal 2001 represents an increase of 14% compared to the prior year. This increase is primarily attributable to the impact of the Merger offset by the positive impact of $300.0 million of 5% fixed rate convertible notes issued by the Company in December of 2000 and a decrease of approximately 50 basis points in average borrowing rates under the Companys variable rate debt facilities, which more than offset the increase in average levels of debt. Excluding the impact of the Merger and the related refinancings described below, average borrowings during the year ended September 30, 2001 were $614 million as compared to average borrowings of $612 million in the prior year. Income tax expense of $76.9 million in fiscal 2001 reflected an effective tax rate of 38.3% versus 38.0% in the prior fiscal year. This slight increase in the effective rate reflects the inclusion of one month of Bergens operating results. Net income of $123.8 million represents an increase of 25% over the prior year. Special items had the effect of reducing net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 by $13.1 million and increased net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 by $0.7 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $2.10 per share as compared to $1.90 per share in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2001 includes the impact of the shares issued to effect the Merger and the shares assumed issued under the 5% convertible subordinated notes. Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment Operating revenue for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 increased 36% to $15.8 billion from $11.6 billion in the prior fiscal year. Excluding the impact of the Merger, operating revenue increased 20%. During the year ended September 30, 2001, 53% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and the remaining 47% was from retail customers. In fiscal 2000, the customer mix was 51% institutional and 49% retail. During the year ended September 30, 2001, sales to institutional customers increased 42% and sales to retail customers increased 29%. Excluding the impact of the Merger, institutional operating revenue increased 26% and retail operating revenue increased 14%. The increase in institutional operating revenue was primarily due to revenue growth with the Novation group purchasing organization (GPO) and the Veterans Administration as well as significant increases in the alternate site customer group. During calendar 2000, members of the Novation GPO went through a distributor selection process and, as a result, the Company added over $500 million in annualized operating revenue in fiscal 2001. Operating revenue from the Veterans Administration accounted for approximately 30% of total institutional operating revenue. Alternate site sales increased 54% during fiscal 2001 due to the full year impact of a mail order customer added in the third quarter of the prior year which accounted for 20% of the increase. In addition, numerous new alternate site accounts were added during the year. The increase in retail operating revenue was consistent with overall industry growth rates. In the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, gross profit of $660.4 million in fiscal 2001 increased by 27% as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of operating revenue, the gross profit in fiscal 2001 was 4.19% as compared to 4.48% in the prior year. The year to year decline reflects the net impact of a number of factors including the change in customer mix to a higher level of larger institutional, mail order and chain accounts, and the continuing competitive pricing environment, offset, in part, by higher buy side margins than in the prior year. Gross profit was adversely impacted in fiscal 2001 by a $5.6 million write down of inventory, primarily related to the Companys decision to exit the designer fragrance business at its cosmetic distribution subsidiary. Total operating expenses increased 21% in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment to $386.2 million, primarily as a result of the Merger. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses decreased to 2.45% in fiscal 2001 from 2.74% in the prior year. This decrease reflects the changing customer mix described above, and efficiencies of scale, as well as the continued elimination of costs and productivity improvements throughout the Companys distribution network. Total operating income increased 36% in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment to $274.2 million. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income was 1.74% in fiscal 2001 and 1.73% in the prior year, reflecting the net effect of the decline in gross margins offset by the reduction in operating expenses discussed above. PharMerica Segment The PharMerica segment was acquired in connection with the Merger and its operating revenue of $116.7 million and operating income of $6.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2001 reflects approximately one month of operating results. On a pro forma combined basis, PharMericas fiscal 2001 operating revenue increased 6% to $1.35 billion from $1.27 billion in the prior year. 21 Table of Contents Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to PharMerica. AmerisourceBergen Drug Company is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to PharMerica. Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing the Companys financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the Company through its pharmaceutical service activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. In determining the appropriate allowance, the Company considers a combination of factors, such as industry trends, its customers financial strength and credit standing, and payment and default history. The calculation of the required allowance requires a substantial amount of judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables. Merchandise Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 96% and 97% of the Companys inventories at September 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively, is determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method. If the Company had used the first in, first out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $152.3 million and $91.7 million higher than the amounts reported at September 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets as of October 1, 2001. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Accordingly, the Company ceased amortization of all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of October 1, 2001. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer lists and patents, will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. SFAS No. 142 requires a two step impairment test for goodwill. The first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step is required to be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The determination of the fair value of the Companys reporting units is based, among other things, on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued. The Company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually. Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. The Company completed its required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and determined that there was no impairment. Stock Options The Company has the choice to account for stock options using either Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25) or SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The Company has elected to use the accounting method under APB 25 and the related interpretations to account for its stock options. Under APB 25, generally, when the exercise price of the Companys stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. Had the Company elected to use SFAS No. 123 to account for its stock options under the fair value method, it would have been required to record compensation expense and as a result, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000 would have been lower by $0.10, $0.37, and $0.11, respectively. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table illustrates the Companys debt structure at September 30, 2002, including availability under revolving credit facilities and receivables securitization facilities (in thousands): Outstanding Balance Additional Availability Fixed Rate Debt: Bergen 7 3/8% senior notes due 2003 $ 150,419 $ Bergen 7 1/4% senior notes due 2005 99,758 8 1/8% senior notes due 2008 500,000 PharMerica 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes due 2008 124,532 AmeriSource 5% convertible subordinated notes due 2007 300,000 Bergen 6 7/8% exchangeable subordinated debentures due 2011 8,425 Bergen 7.80% trust preferred securities due 2039 275,288 Other 3,891 Total fixed rate debt 1,462,313 Variable Rate Debt: Term loan facility due 2003 to 2006 300,000 Blanco revolving credit facility due 2003 55,000 Revolving credit facility due 2006 937,615 AmeriSource receivables securitization financing due 2004 400,000 Bergen receivables securitization financing due 2005 450,000 Total variable rate debt 355,000 1,787,615 Total debt, including current portion $ 1,817,313 $ 1,787,615 The Companys working capital usage fluctuates widely during the year, generally peaking in the second fiscal quarter due to seasonal inventory buying requirements and buy side purchasing opportunities. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Companys highest utilization was 79% of the aggregate availability under its revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facilities, which are described below. In fiscal 2003, the Company expects that its debt utilization will again be at its highest in the second quarter due to seasonal inventory buying requirements and buy side purchasing opportunities. In November 2002, the Company issued $300 million of 7 1/4% senior notes due November 15, 2012 (the 7 1/4% Notes). The 7 1/4% Notes are redeemable at the Companys option at any time before maturity at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of redemption and, under some circumstances, a redemption premium. Interest on the 7 1/4% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears, commencing May 15, 2003. The 7 1/4% Notes rank junior to the Senior Credit Agreement (defined below) and equal to the Companys other senior unsecured notes outstanding as of September 30, 2002. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the 7 1/4% Notes to repay $15 million of the term loan in December 2002 and $150 million in aggregate principal of the Bergen 7 3/8% senior notes due January 15, 2003. Additionally, the Company intends to redeem the PharMerica 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes due 2008 at a redemption price equal to 104.19% of the principal amount thereof. In connection with the issuance of the 7 1/4% Notes, the Company incurred approximately $4.9 million of costs which were deferred and will be amortized over the ten year term of the notes. In connection with the Merger, the Company issued $500 million of 8 1/8% senior notes due 2008 (the 8 1/8% Notes) and entered into a $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility (the Senior Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders. Proceeds from these facilities were used to: replace existing AmeriSource and Bergen revolving credit facilities; pay certain merger transaction fees and fees associated with the financings; redeem $184.6 million of PharMerica 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes due 2008 via a tender offer; and meet general corporate purposes. In addition, the Company assumed $405.3 million of fixed debt. During fiscal 2002, the Company redeemed all $20.6 million of the Bergen 7% convertible subordinated debentures due 2006 pursuant to a tender offer required as a result of the Merger. The 8 1/8% Notes pay interest semiannually in arrears and rank junior to the Senior Credit Agreement. The 8 1/8% Notes are redeemable at the Companys option at any time before maturity at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount 23 Table of Contents thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of redemption and, under some circumstances, a redemption premium. The Senior Credit Agreement consists of a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $300 million term loan facility (the Term Facility), both maturing in August 2006. The Term Facility has scheduled maturities on a quarterly basis beginning December 31, 2002, totaling $60 million in each of fiscal 2003 and 2004, and $80 million and $100 million in fiscal 2005 and 2006, respectively. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility at September 30, 2002. Interest on borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement accrues at specified rates based on the Companys debt ratings. Such rates range from 1.0% to 2.5% over LIBOR or 0% to 1.5% over prime. Currently, the rate is 1.5% over LIBOR or .50% over prime. Availability under the Revolving Facility is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit ($62.4 million at September 30, 2002). The Company pays quarterly commitment fees to maintain the availability under the Revolving Facility at specified rates based on the Companys debt ratings ranging from .25% to .50% of the unused availability. Currently, the rate is .375%. The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and restrictions as described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company can choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Senior Credit Agreement at any time. Substantially all of the Companys assets, except for trade receivables sold into the AmeriSource and Bergen receivables securitization facilities (as described below), collateralize the Senior Credit Agreement. In connection with the issuance of the 8 1/8% Notes and the Senior Credit Agreement, the Company incurred approximately $24.0 million of costs which were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the respective issues. In December 2000, the Company issued $300.0 million of 5% convertible subordinated notes due December 1, 2007. The notes have an annual interest rate of 5%, payable semiannually, and are convertible into common stock of the Company at $52.97 per share at any time before their maturity or their prior redemption or repurchase by the Company. On or after December 3, 2004, the Company has the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes that have not been previously converted. Net proceeds from the notes of approximately $290.6 million were used to repay existing borrowings, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. In connection with the issuance of the notes, the Company incurred approximately $9.4 million of financing fees which were deferred and are being amortized over the seven year term of the notes. At September 30, 2002, there were no borrowings under the AmeriSource $400 million receivables securitization facility. The facility has an expiration date of May 2004 and interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper plus a program fee of 38.5 basis points. In order to borrow available amounts under this securitization facility, a back up 364 day liquidity facility is required to be in place. The current liquidity facility expires in May 2003, but the Company expects that it will be renewed through May 2004. The $450 million Bergen receivables securitization facility expires in December 2005, and interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper plus a program fee of 75 basis points. In December 2001, the Company temporarily increased its availability under the Bergen receivables securitization facility to $600 million through June 29, 2002. On June 30, 2002, the availability under the Bergen receivables securitization facility was reduced back to $450 million. In December 2002, the Company obtained an increase to its availability under the Bergen receivables securitization facility up to $700 million to fund discretionary inventory buying opportunities. The Bergen receivables securitization facility may be subject to termination in the event of a material adverse effect, among other things, on the financial condition, business, operations or prospects of AmerisourceBergen. If a termination were to occur, a cross default might be triggered under the Senior Credit Agreement. Management believes that the likelihood of such a termination being triggered is remote. At September 30, 2002, there were no borrowings under either of the receivables securitization facilities. The receivables securitization facilities represent financing vehicles utilized by the Company because of the availability of attractive interest rates relative to other financing sources. The Company securitizes its trade accounts and notes receivable, which are generally non interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings under SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed Bergens Capital I Trust (the Trust), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bergen. In May 1999, the Trust issued 12,000,000 shares of 7.80% trust originated preferred securities (SM) (TOPrS(SM)) (the Trust Preferred Securities) at $25 per security. The proceeds of such issuances were invested by the Trust in $300 million aggregate principal amount of Bergens 7.80% subordinated deferrable interest notes due June 30, 2039 (the Subordinated Notes). The Subordinated Notes represent the sole assets of the Trust and bear interest at the annual rate of 7.80%, payable quarterly, and are redeemable by the Company beginning in May 2004 at 100% of the principal amount thereof. The Trust Preferred Securities will be redeemable upon any repayment of the Subordinated Notes at 100% of the liquidation amount beginning in May 2004. The obligations of the Trust related to the Trust Preferred Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. 24 Table of Contents Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities are entitled to cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 7.80% of the liquidation amount of $25 per security. The Trust paid cash distributions of $23.4 million in during fiscal 2002. The Company, under certain conditions, may cause the Trust to defer the payment of distributions for successive periods of up to 20 consecutive quarters. During such periods, accrued distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities will compound quarterly at an annual rate of 7.80%. Also during such periods, the Company may not declare or pay distributions on its capital stock; may not redeem, purchase or make a liquidation payment on any of its capital stock; and may not make interest, principal or premium payments on, or repurchase or redeem, any of its debt securities that rank equal with or junior to the Subordinated Notes. The Companys operating results have generated sufficient cash flow which, together with borrowings under its debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, fund capital expenditures, and fund the payment of interest on outstanding debt. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the payment of interest on indebtedness, finance Merger integration initiatives and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund the Companys ongoing cash requirements. Following is a summary of the Companys contractual obligations for future principal payments on its debt and preferred securities, minimum rental payments on its noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on its other commitments at September 30, 2002 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Within 1 year 1 3 years  4 5 years  After 5 years Debt $ 1,840,800 $ 265,819 $ 241,228 $ 101,229 $ 1,232,524 Operating leases 155,421 51,553 62,521 28,882 12,465 Other commitments 14,936 8,936 6,000 Total $ 2,011,157 $ 326,308 $ 309,749 $ 130,111 $ 1,244,989 The debt amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the consolidated balance sheet due to the purchase accounting adjustments recorded in order to reflect Bergens obligations at fair value on the effective date of the Merger. These differences are being amortized over the terms of the respective obligations. In addition, the Companys $150 million 7 3/8% senior notes, which are due in January 2003, and Blancos $55 million revolving credit facility, which expires in May 2003, are included in the Within 1 year column in the above repayment table. However, these two borrowings are not classified in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2002 because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance them on a long term basis as evidenced by the Companys November 2002 issuance of $300 million of 7 1/4% senior notes due November 2012. Additionally, borrowings under the Puerto Rican facility are secured by a standby letter of credit under the Senior Credit Agreement, and therefore the Company is effectively financing this debt on a long term basis through that arrangement. Other commitments include a future minimum payment of $10 million, as described in Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, relating to the Companys acquisition of a physician management consulting company. The Company has paid $5 million for a 20% equity interest and currently expects to pay between $70 million and $80 million during fiscal years 2003 through 2005, of which $60 million to $70 million is contingent upon the entitys ability to achieve defined earnings targets, for its 100% equity ownership in the entity. The contingent payments are not reflected in the above table. Additionally, as described in Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the AutoMed agreement and plan of merger provides for contingent payments not to exceed $55 million, to be made based on AutoMed achieving defined earnings targets through the end of calendar 2004. The AutoMed contingent payments may be made in cash and or Company common stock at the discretion of the Company, and are not reflected in the above table. In connection with its merger integration plans, the Company intends to build six new distribution facilities and expand seven others over the next 3 to 4 years. The Company has begun to enter into various commitments with third parties relating to site selection, purchase of land, design and construction of the new facilities. As of September 30, 2002, the Company has entered into $4.9 million of commitments relating to the construction of the new facilities. The facility commitments are included 25 Table of Contents in Other Commitments in the above table. In December 2002, the Company entered into a 15 year lease obligation totaling $17.4 million for one of the facilities. During the year ended September 30, 2002, the Companys operating activities provided $535.9 million in cash as compared to $45.9 million of cash used in fiscal 2001. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2002 was principally the result of $344.9 million of net income and $190.0 million of non cash items affecting net income. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were only $1.0 million as a $362.2 million increase in merchandise inventories and a $133.6 million increase in accounts and notes receivable were offset primarily by a $514.1 increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes. The increase in merchandise inventories reflects inventory required to support the strong revenue increase, as well as inventory purchased to take advantage of buy side gross profit opportunities including opportunities associated with manufacturer price increases and negotiated deals. Inventory grew at a rate less than sales due to the consolidation of seven facilities in fiscal 2002 and improved inventory management. Accounts and notes receivable, before changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts, increased only 3%, despite the 16% increase in operating revenues, on a pro forma combined basis. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, the Companys days sales outstanding improved as a result of continued emphasis on receivables management at the local level. Days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment improved to 16.4 days in fiscal 2002 from 17.7 days in the prior year, on a pro forma combined basis. Days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment improved to 43.5 days in fiscal 2002 from 53.4 days in the prior year, on a pro forma combined basis. The $376.0 million increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the merchandise inventory increase as well as the timing of payments to suppliers. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 included $137.9 million in interest payments, inclusive of the cash distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities, and $111.9 million in income tax payments, net of refunds. During the year ended September 30, 2001, the Companys operating activities used $45.9 million in cash as compared to $216.6 million cash generated in fiscal 2000. Cash used in operations in fiscal 2001 resulted from increases of $726.1 million in merchandise inventories and $151.6 million in accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of $613.3 million. The increase in merchandise inventories reflected necessary inventories to support the strong revenue increase, and inventory purchased to take advantage of buy side gross profit margin opportunities including opportunities associated with manufacturer price increases and negotiated deals. Additionally, inventories at September 30, 2001 included safety stock purchased due to uncertainties regarding possible increased customer demands or disruptions in the supply stream as the result of the terrorist events of September 11, 2001. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes is net of merger related payments of approximately $58.8 million, primarily executive compensation payments made in August 2001. During the year ended September 30, 2000, the Companys operating activities generated $216.6 million in cash as compared to $3.0 million generated in fiscal 1999. Cash generation from operations in fiscal 2000 resulted from an increase of $416.0 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes offset by increases in accounts receivable of $23.8 million and merchandise inventories of $327.4 million. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes in excess of the increase in merchandise inventories was due to a 4% increase in days payable outstanding during the year due to the centralization of accounts payable processing and the timing of vendor purchases. Accounts receivable (net) increased only 2% despite the 19% revenue increase due to the change in customer mix to quicker paying health systems customers and the collection of a disputed receivable. Merchandise inventories increased 26% reflecting the changes in customer mix and to support anticipated new customer contracts, including additional business with the Novation group purchasing organization, and seasonal buying opportunities. The Company paid a total of $15.6 million, $2.9 million and $3.6 million of severance, contract, and lease cancellation and other costs in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to the cost reduction plans discussed above. Severance accruals of $8.1 million and remaining contract and lease obligations of $1.0 million at September 30, 2002 are included in accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the years ended September 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $64.2 million, $23.4 million and $16.6 million, respectively, and relate principally to investments in warehouse improvements, information technology and warehouse automation. We have developed merger integration plans to consolidate our existing pharmaceutical distribution facility network and establish new, more efficient distribution centers. More specifically, our plan is to have a distribution facility network consisting of 30 facilities. We plan to accomplish this by building six new facilities, expanding seven facilities, closing 27 facilities and implementing a new warehouse operating system. Capital expenditures related to this plan are expected to be approximately $300 million to $350 million over the next 3 years. We anticipate that future cash flows from operations along with our existing availability under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facilities will be adequate to fund our merger integration plans. The Company estimates that it will spend approximately $100 million to $130 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2003. 26 Table of Contents During fiscal 2002, the Company acquired AutoMed Technologies, Inc. for $120.4 million. The Company also acquired other smaller businesses for $15.8 million. Additionally, the Company purchased equity interests in various businesses for $4.1 million. During fiscal 2001, the Company sold the net assets of one of its specialty products distribution facilities for approximately $13.0 million. During fiscal 2000, the Company and three other healthcare distributors formed an Internet based company that is an independent, commercially neutral healthcare product information exchange focused on streamlining the process involved in identifying, purchasing and distributing healthcare products and services. The Company contributed $1.2 million, $6.5 million and $3.7 million to the joint venture in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and its ownership interest of approximately 22% was accounted for under the equity method. This entity merged in November 2001 with the Global Health Exchange LLC, a similar venture, and the Companys ongoing ownership interest in the Global Health Exchange LLC is 4%. Since then, the Company has accounted for its share of the joint venture using the cost method of accounting. During the year ended September 30, 2002, the Company made net repayments of $37.0 million on its receivables securitization facilities. The Company also repaid debt of $23.1 million during the year, principally consisting of $20.6 million for the retirement of Bergens 7% debentures pursuant to a tender offer which was required as a result of the Merger. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2001 primarily represents the net effect of borrowings to fund working capital requirements, the refinancing and merger costs described above. In fiscal 2000, cash used by financing activities represented net repayments of the Companys revolving credit facility from cash provided by operations. The Company paid its first quarterly dividend, a cash dividend of $0.025 per share on common stock, on December 3, 2001. Dividends of $0.025 per share were paid on March 1, 2002, June 3, 2002 and September 3, 2002. A dividend of $0.025 per share was declared by the board of directors on October 30, 2002, and was paid on December 2, 2002 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 18, 2002. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Companys board of directors and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. The Companys most significant market risk is the effect of changing interest rates. The Company manages this risk by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. At September 30, 2002, the Company had approximately $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.3% and $355 million of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.5%. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the Companys working capital requirements. The Company periodically evaluates various financial instruments that could mitigate a portion of its exposure to variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. There were no such financial instruments in effect at September 30, 2002. For every $100 million of unhedged variable rate debt outstanding, a 35 basis point increase in interest rates (one tenth of the average variable rate at September 30, 2002) would increase the Companys annual interest expense by $0.35 million. Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As of October 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, which revised the accounting and financial reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company did not amortize goodwill arising from the Merger in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2002, the Company discontinued the amortization of all goodwill. Had the Company not amortized goodwill during fiscal 2001 and 2000, net income for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000 would have been approximately $0.9 million and $0.6 million higher than the reported amounts, respectively, and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.02 higher than the reported amount in each year. Pursuant to SFAS No. 142, the Company was required to complete an initial impairment test of goodwill within six months of adopting the standard, with any impairment charges recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company completed its initial impairment test in the quarter ended March 31, 2002 and determined that no impairment existed. The Company completed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and determined that no impairment existed. 27 Table of Contents In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This standard sets forth the accounting for the impairment of long lived assets, whether they are held and used or are disposed of by sale or other means. It also broadens and modifies the presentation of discontinued operations. The standard will be effective for the Companys fiscal year 2003, although early adoption is permitted, and its provisions are generally to be applied prospectively. The Company does not believe this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. This standard addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. These costs relate to termination benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated, costs to terminate a contract, and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under SFAS No. 146, an entitys commitment to a plan does not by itself create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability. SFAS No. 146 also establishes fair value as the objective for the initial liability. The standard will be effective for exit costs or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, although early adoption is encouraged. The Company elected to adopt this standard in September 2002. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002. We have traditionally recognized certain costs associated with restructuring plans as of the date of commitment to the plan. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 could result in the deferral of recognition of such costs for restructuring plans from the date we commit to a plan to the date we actually incur the costs associated with a plan.
