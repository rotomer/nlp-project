ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained herein. The Company AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the Company) is a leading national wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products and related healthcare services and solutions with $45.5 billion in annual operating revenue. The Company was formed in connection with the merger of AmeriSource Health Corporation (AmeriSource) and Bergen Brunswig Corporation (Bergen) on August 29, 2001 (the Merger). The Company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers. The Companys operating segments have been aggregated into two reportable segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica. The Pharmaceutical Distribution segment includes AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC) and AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG). ABDC includes the full service wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities and other healthcare related businesses. ABDC sells pharmaceuticals, over the counter medicines, health and beauty aids, and other health related products to hospitals, alternate care and mail order facilities and independent and chain retail pharmacies. ABDC, directly and through subsidiaries and affiliates, including American Health Packaging, Anderson Packaging, AutoMed Technologies, Bridge Medical and Pharmacy Healthcare Solutions, also provides promotional, packaging, inventory management, pharmacy automation, bedside medication safety software and information services to its customers and healthcare product manufacturers. ABSG sells specialty pharmaceutical products and services to physicians, clinics, patients and other providers in the oncology, nephrology, plasma and vaccines sectors. ABSG also provides third party logistics, reimbursement consulting services, physician education consulting and other services to healthcare product manufacturers. The PharMerica segment consists solely of the Companys PharMerica operations. PharMerica provides institutional pharmacy products and services to patients in long term care and alternate site settings, including skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and residential living communities. PharMerica also provides mail order and on line pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers compensation programs, and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors. 17 Summary Segment Information Comparative Information for Fiscal 2003 and 2002 AmerisourceBergen Corporation Summary Segment Information Operating Revenue Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2003 2002 Change Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 44,731,200 $ 39,539,858 13 % PharMerica 1,608,203 1,475,028 9 Intersegment eliminations (802,714 ) (774,172 ) (4 ) Total $ 45,536,689 $ 40,240,714 13 % Operating Income Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2003 2002 Change Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 788,193 $ 659,208 20 % PharMerica 103,843 83,464 24 Facility consolidations and employee severance and merger costs (special items) (8,930 ) (24,244 ) 63 Total $ 883,106 $ 718,428 23 % Percentages of operating revenue: Pharmaceutical Distribution Gross profit 3.85 % 3.87 % Operating expenses 2.09 % 2.20 % Operating income 1.76 % 1.67 % PharMerica Gross profit 32.69 % 33.49 % Operating expenses 26.23 % 27.83 % Operating income 6.46 % 5.66 % AmerisourceBergen Corporation Gross profit 4.93 % 5.03 % Operating expenses 3.00 % 3.25 % Operating income 1.94 % 1.79 % 18 Summary Segment Information Comparative Information for Fiscal 2002 and 2001 (Including Pro Forma Information for Fiscal 2001) The Companys fiscal 2001 results include a full year of AmeriSources results and approximately one month of Bergens results. In order to enhance comparability to the fiscal 2002 results, we have included pro forma information for fiscal 2001 results of operations. For purposes of this discussion, pro forma refers to the combined results of AmeriSource and Bergen for fiscal 2001. They are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which might have occurred had the operations and management of AmeriSource and Bergen been combined at the beginning of fiscal 2001. The following information also includes the results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2001 on a pro forma basis by reportable segment. To further improve the comparability between fiscal years, the pro forma combined information for the year ended September 30, 2001 excludes amortization of goodwill (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and reflects the full allocation of Bergens former Corporate segment to the Companys Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments. Such pro forma information and the related discussion is limited to the line items comprising operating income. Due to the changes in the Companys debt structure which occurred in connection with the Merger, pro forma combined interest expense for fiscal 2001 would not be directly comparable to the Companys fiscal 2002 interest expense. 19 AmerisourceBergen Corporation Summary Segment Information Operating Revenue Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) Actual 2002 Actual 2001 Pro forma2001 (1) Actual %Change Pro forma %Change Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 39,539,858 $ 15,770,042 $ 33,985,611 151 % 16 % PharMerica 1,475,028 116,719 1,350,008 1,164 9 Intersegment Eliminations (774,172 ) (64,126 ) (736,309 ) 5 Total $ 40,240,714 $ 15,822,635 $ 34,599,310 154 % 16 % Operating Income Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) Actual 2002 Actual 2001 Pro forma2001 (1) Actual %Change Pro forma %Change Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 659,208 $ 274,209 $ 551,827 140 % 19 % PharMerica 83,464 6,472 68,856 1,190 21 Merger costs, facility consolidations and employee severance, and environmental remediation (special items) (24,244 ) (21,305 ) 2,716 Other adjustments (2) (16,313 ) Total $ 718,428 $ 259,376 $ 607,086 177 % 18 % Percentages of operating revenue: Pharmaceutical Distribution Gross profit 3.87 % 4.19 % 4.13 % Operating expenses 2.20 % 2.45 % 2.51 % Operating income 1.67 % 1.74 % 1.62 % PharMerica Gross profit 33.49 % 34.06 % 35.24 % Operating expenses 27.83 % 28.51 % 30.14 % Operating income 5.66 % 5.55 % 5.10 % AmerisourceBergen Corporation Gross profit 5.03 % 4.42 % 5.44 % Operating expenses 3.25 % 2.79 % 3.68 % Operating income 1.79 % 1.64 % 1.75 % (1) Represents the combination of AmeriSource Health Corporations and Bergen Brunswig Corporations financial information.

This increase is primarily due to increased operating revenue in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. Bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 decreased 17% to $4.1 billion from $5.0 billion in the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to the Companys conversion of a portion of its bulk and other direct business with its primary bulk delivery customer to business serviced through the Companys various warehouses. Due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries, fluctuations in volume of bulk deliveries have no significant impact on operating margins. However, revenue from bulk deliveries has had a positive impact to the Companys cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the Company and the payments by the Company to its suppliers. Gross profit of $2,247.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflects an increase of 11% from $2,024.5 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 was 4.93%, as compared to the prior year percentage of 5.03%. The decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflects declines in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments primarily due to changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures, offset in part by the positive aggregate margin impact resulting from the Companys recent acquisitions. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization (DSAD&A) of $1,355.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflects an increase of 6% compared to $1,281.8 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, DSAD&A in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 was 2.98% compared to 3.19% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in the DSAD&A percentage from the prior fiscal year ratio reflects improvements in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to customer mix changes, operational efficiencies and continued benefits from the merger integration effort. In connection with the Merger, the Company developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicate administrative functions, which are expected to result in synergies of approximately $150 million annually by the end of fiscal 2004. The Companys plan is to have a distribution facility network consisting of 30 facilities in the next three to four years. This will be accomplished by building six new facilities, expanding seven facilities, and closing 27 facilities. During fiscal 2003, the Company began construction activities on three of its new facilities and completed two of the seven facility expansions. During fiscal 2003 and 2002, the Company closed six and seven distribution facilities, respectively. The Company anticipates closing three additional facilities in fiscal 2004. In September 2001, the Company announced plans to close seven distribution facilities in fiscal 2002, consisting of six former AmeriSource facilities and one former Bergen facility. A charge of $10.9 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 related to the AmeriSource facilities, and included $6.2 million of severance for approximately 260 warehouse and administrative personnel to be terminated, $2.3 million in lease and contract cancellations, and $2.4 million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed. Approximately $0.2 million of costs related to the Bergen facility were included in the Merger purchase price allocation. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, severance accruals of $1.8 million recorded in September 2001 were reversed into income because certain employees who were expected to be severed either voluntarily left the Company or were retained in other positions within the Company. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, the Company announced further integration initiatives relating to the closure of Bergens repackaging facility and the elimination of certain Bergen administrative functions, including the closure of a related office facility. The cost of these initiatives of approximately $19.2 million, which included $15.8 million of severance for approximately 310 employees to be terminated, $1.6 million for lease cancellation costs, and $1.8 million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed, resulted in additional goodwill being recorded during fiscal 2002. At September 30, 2003, substantially all of the 310 employees have been terminated. Since September 2002, the Company has announced plans to close six distribution facilities in fiscal 2003 and eliminate certain administrative and operational functions (the fiscal 2003 initiatives). As of September 30, 2003, the six facilities were 21 closed. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company recorded severance costs of $10.3 million and lease cancellation costs of $1.1 million relating to the fiscal 2003 initiatives. Employee severance and lease cancellation costs related to the fiscal 2003 initiatives have been recognized in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Employee severance costs are generally expensed during the employee service period and lease cancellation and other costs are generally expensed when the Company becomes contractually bound to pay such costs. In the future, the Company expects to incur an additional $1.0 million of employee severance costs relating to the fiscal 2003 initiatives. As of September 30, 2003, approximately 520 employees had been provided termination notices as a result of the fiscal 2003 initiatives, of which 490 were terminated. Additional amounts for integration initiatives will be recognized in subsequent periods as facilities to be consolidated are identified and specific plans are approved and announced. The Company paid a total of $13.8 million and $15.6 million for employee severance and lease and contract cancellation costs in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to the aforementioned integration plans. Remaining unpaid amounts of $5.0 million for employee severance and lease cancellation costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2003. Most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time, generally not to exceed 12 months, while others may receive a lump sum payment. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, the Company expensed approximately $24.2 million of merger costs, primarily related to integrating the operations of AmeriSource and Bergen. Such costs were comprised primarily of consulting fees, which amounted to $16.6 million. The merger costs also included a $2.1 million adjustment to the Companys fourth quarter 2001 charge of $6.5 million relating to the accelerated vesting of AmeriSource stock options. Effective October 1, 2002, the Company converted its merger integration office to an operations management office. Accordingly, the costs of the operations management office are included within distribution, selling and administrative expenses in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. Operating income of $883.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflects an increase of 23% from $718.4 million in the prior fiscal year. Special items reduced the Companys operating income by $8.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 and by $24.2 million in the prior fiscal year. The Companys operating income as a percentage of operating revenue was 1.94% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 compared to 1.79% in the prior fiscal year. The improvement was primarily due to the lower amount of special items and the aforementioned DSAD&A expense percentage reduction. The Company recorded equity in losses of affiliates and other of $8.0 million and $5.6 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These amounts primarily consisted of impairment charges relating to investments in technology companies. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company recorded a $4.2 million loss resulting from the early retirement of debt (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Interest expense increased 3% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 to $144.7 million from $140.7 million in the prior fiscal year. Average borrowings, net of invested cash, under the Companys debt facilities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 were $2.3 billion as compared to average borrowings, net of invested cash, of $2.0 billion in the prior fiscal year. Average borrowing rates under the Companys debt facilities decreased to 5.6% in the current fiscal year from 6.1% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in average borrowings, net of invested cash, was primarily a result of additional merchandise inventories on hand during the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in average borrowing rates resulted from lower percentages of fixed rate debt outstanding to total debt outstanding in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as lower market interest rates on variable rate debt. Income tax expense of $284.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflects an effective tax rate of 39.2%, versus 39.7% in the prior fiscal year. The Company has been able to lower its effective tax rate during the current fiscal year by implementing tax planning strategies. Net income of $441.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflects an increase of 28% from $344.9 million in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share of $3.89 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflects a 23% increase as compared to $3.16 per share in the prior fiscal year. Special items and the loss on early retirement of debt had the effect of decreasing net income by $8.0 million and reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.07 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. Special items had the effect of decreasing net income by $14.6 million and reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.13 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002. The growth in earnings per share was smaller than the growth in 22 net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 due to the issuance of Company common stock in connection with the acquisitions described in Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements and in connection with the exercise of stock options. Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue of $44.7 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflects an increase of 13% from $39.5 billion in the prior fiscal year. The Companys recent acquisitions contributed less than 0.5% of the segments operating revenue growth for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, 56% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 44% was from retail customers; this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 53% institutional and 47% retail. In comparison with the prior year results, sales to institutional customers increased 20% primarily due to (i) the previously mentioned conversion of bulk delivery and other direct business with the Companys primary bulk delivery customer to business serviced through the Companys various warehouses, which contributed 4% of the total operating revenue growth; (ii) above market rate growth of the ABSG specialty pharmaceutical business; and (iii) higher revenues from customers engaged in the mail order sale of pharmaceuticals. Sales to retail customers increased by 5% in comparison to the prior fiscal year. The growth rate of sales to retail customers has declined during fiscal 2003 compared to the fiscal 2002 growth primarily due to lower growth trends in the retail market and the below market growth of certain of the Companys large regional chain customers. Additionally, retail sales in the second half of fiscal 2003 were adversely impacted by the loss of a large customer. This segments growth largely reflects U.S. pharmaceutical industry conditions, including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset, in part, by the increased use of lower priced generics. The segments growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix. Industry growth rates, as estimated by industry data firm IMS Healthcare, Inc., are expected to be between 10% and 13% over the next four years. Future operating revenue growth will continue to be driven by industry growth trends, competition within the industry and customer consolidation. Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit of $1,721.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflects an increase of 12% from $1,530.5 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 was 3.85%, as compared to 3.87% in the prior fiscal year. The slight decline in gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue was the net result of the negative impact of a change in customer mix to a higher percentage of large institutional, mail order and chain accounts, and the continuing competitive pricing environment, offset primarily by the positive aggregate impact of recently acquired companies, which amounted to 15 basis points in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. Downward pressures on sell side gross profit margin are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that the inclusion of additional businesses that generate higher margins or that increases in the buy side component of the gross margin, including increases derived from manufacturer price increases, negotiated deals and secondary market opportunities, will be available in the future to fully or partially offset the anticipated decline of the sell side margin. The Company expects that buy side opportunities may decrease in the future as pharmaceutical manufacturers increasingly seek to control the supply channel through product allocations that limit the inventory the Company can purchase and through the imposition of inventory management and other agreements that prohibit or severely restrict the Companys right to purchase inventory from secondary source suppliers. Although the Company seeks in any such agreements to obtain appropriate compensation from pharmaceutical manufacturers for foregoing buy side opportunities, there can be no assurance that the agreements will function as intended and replace any or all lost profit opportunities. The Companys cost of goods sold includes a last in, first out (LIFO) provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating expenses of $933.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflects an increase of 7% from $871.3 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 were 2.09%, as compared to 2.20% in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in the expense percentage reflects the changing customer mix described above, efficiencies of scale, the elimination of redundant costs through the merger integration process, the continued emphasis on productivity throughout the Companys distribution network and a reduction of bad debt expense, offset, in part, by higher expense ratios associated with the Companys recent acquisitions. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income of $788.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflects an increase of 20% from $659.2 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 was 1.76%, as compared to 1.67% in the prior fiscal year. The improvement over the prior year percentage was due to a reduction in the operating expense ratio in excess of the decline in gross margin, which was partially the result of the Companys ability to capture synergy cost savings from the Merger. While management historically has been able to 23 lower expense ratios and expects to continue to do so, there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future, or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible declines in gross margins. Additionally, there can be no assurance that merger integration efforts will proceed as planned or result in the desired cost savings. PharMerica Segment PharMericas operating revenue increased 9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 to $1,608.2 million compared to $1,475.0 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase is principally attributable to the growth in PharMericas workers compensation business, which has grown at a faster rate than its long term care business. During the second half of fiscal 2003, the growth rate of the workers compensation business began to slow down, partially due to the loss of a significant customer. The slow down in the workers compensation business is expected to continue in fiscal 2004 and as a result, the operating revenue growth rate in fiscal 2004 for the PharMerica segment is expected to be in the mid single digits. The future operating revenue growth rate will be impacted by competitive pressures, changes in the regulatory environment and the pharmaceutical inflation rate. PharMericas gross profit of $525.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 increased 6% from gross profit of $494.0 million in the prior fiscal year. PharMericas gross profit margin declined slightly to 32.69% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 from 33.49% in the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily the result of a change in the sales mix, with a greater proportion of PharMericas current year revenues coming from its workers compensation business, which has lower gross profit margins and lower operating expenses than its long term care business. In addition, industry competitive pressures continue to adversely affect gross profit margins. PharMericas operating expenses of $421.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 increased from $410.5 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses were reduced to 26.23% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 from 27.83% in the prior fiscal year. The percentage reduction was primarily due to the continued improvements in operating practices, the aforementioned shift in customer mix towards the workers compensation business and a reduction in bad debt expense. PharMericas operating income of $103.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 increased by 24% from $83.5 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 was 6.46%, as compared to 5.66% in the prior fiscal year. The improvement was due to the aforementioned reduction in the operating expense ratio, which was greater than the reduction in gross profit margin. While management historically has been able to lower expense ratios and expects to continue to do so, there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future, or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible further declines in gross margins. Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to PharMerica. AmerisourceBergen Drug Company is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to PharMerica. Year ended September 30, 2002 compared with Year ended September 30, 2001 Consolidated Results Operating revenue, which excludes bulk deliveries, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 154% to $40.2 billion from $15.8 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase is primarily due to increased operating revenue in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment as a result of the Merger. Operating revenue increased 16% from $34.6 billion in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. This increase is primarily due to the 16% increase in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. As a result of the Merger, bulk deliveries increased to $5.0 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 compared to $368.7 million in the prior fiscal year. Revenue from bulk deliveries increased 10% from $4.5 billion in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. Due to the insignificant service fees generated from these bulk deliveries, fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins. However, revenue from bulk 24 deliveries has a positive impact to the Companys cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to us and the payments by us to our suppliers. Gross profit of $2,024.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects an increase of 189% from $700.1 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and an increase of 8% from $1,880.7 million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 was 5.03%, as compared to prior year percentages of 4.42% on a historical basis and 5.44% on a pro forma combined basis. The increase in the gross profit percentage from prior fiscal year historical results was primarily due to the inclusion of PharMerica in the current year. PharMerica, due to the nature of its prescription fulfillment business, has significantly higher gross margins and operating expense ratios than the Companys Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year pro forma combined percentage reflects declines in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization (DSAD&A) of $1,281.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects an increase of 206% compared to $419.4 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and an increase of less than 1% compared to $1,276.4 million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. As a percentage of operating revenue, DSAD&A in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 was 3.19%, as compared to prior fiscal year percentages of 2.65% on a historical basis and 3.69% on a pro forma combined basis. The increases in the DSAD&A percentage from the prior fiscal year historical results were primarily due to the inclusion of PharMerica in the current year, as explained above. The decrease in the DSAD&A percentage from the prior fiscal year pro forma combined ratio reflects improvements in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to customer mix changes, operational efficiencies and benefits from the merger integration effort. In connection with the Merger, the Company developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicate administrative functions, which are expected to result in synergies of approximately $150 million annually by the end of fiscal 2004. The Companys plan is to have a distribution facility network consisting of 30 facilities in the next three to four years. This will be accomplished by building six new facilities, expanding seven facilities, and closing 27 facilities. During 2002, the Company closed seven distribution facilities. In September 2001, the Company announced plans to close seven distribution facilities in fiscal 2002, consisting of six former AmeriSource facilities and one former Bergen facility. A charge of $10.9 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 related to the AmeriSource facilities, and included $6.2 million of severance for approximately 260 warehouse and administrative personnel to be terminated, $2.3 million in lease and contract cancellations, and $2.4 million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed. Approximately $0.2 million of costs related to the Bergen facility were included in the Merger purchase price allocation. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, the Company announced further integration initiatives relating to the closure of Bergens repackaging facility and the elimination of certain Bergen administrative functions, including the closure of a related office facility. The cost of these initiatives of approximately $19.2 million, which included $15.8 million of severance for approximately 310 employees to be terminated, $1.6 million for lease cancellation costs, and $1.8 million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed, resulted in additional goodwill being recorded during fiscal 2002. In connection with the Merger, the Company expensed merger costs in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 of $24.2 million, consisting primarily of integration consulting fees of $16.6 million. The merger costs also included a $2.1 million increase to the Companys fourth quarter fiscal 2001 charge of $6.5 million relating to the accelerated vesting of AmeriSource stock options. Total merger costs in fiscal 2001 amounted to $13.1 million, primarily consisting of consulting fees and the accelerated stock option vesting charge. Operating income of $718.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects an increase of 177% from $259.4 million in the prior fiscal year. Special items had the effect of reducing the Companys operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 and 2001 by $24.2 million and $21.3 million, respectively. The Companys operating income as a percentage of operating revenue was 1.79% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, as compared to prior year percentages of 1.64% on a historical basis and 1.75% on a pro forma combined basis. The improvements are due to the aforementioned DSAD&A expense percentage reductions more than offsetting the reductions in gross margin. Equity in losses of affiliates and other was $5.6 million and $10.9 million in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, respectively. The fiscal 2002 amount principally reflects an impairment of the Companys investment in a healthcare technology company. The majority of the fiscal 2001 amount represents the impact of the Companys investment in Health Nexus, LLC, which was 25 accounted for on the equity method. The Companys percentage ownership in the successor to Health Nexus, LLC fell below 20% in November 2001, and this investment is now accounted for using the cost method. Interest expense, which includes the distributions on preferred securities of a subsidiary trust, increased 194% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 to $140.7 million compared to $47.9 million in the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of the Merger. Average borrowings, net of invested cash, under the Companys debt facilities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 were $2.0 billion as compared to average borrowings, net of invested cash, of $696 million in the prior fiscal year. Average borrowing rates under the Companys variable rate debt facilities decreased to 3.5% in the current fiscal year from 6.2% in the prior fiscal year, due to lower market interest rates. Income tax expense of $227.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects an effective tax rate of 39.7% versus 38.3% in the prior fiscal year. The tax rate for fiscal 2002 was higher than the prior fiscal years tax rate as a result of the Merger. Net income of $344.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects an increase of 179% from $123.8 million in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share of $3.16 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects a 50% increase as compared to $2.10 per share in the prior fiscal year. Special items had the effect of reducing net income and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 by $14.6 million and $0.13, respectively, and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 by $13.1 million and $0.21, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 reflects the full year impact of the shares issued to effect the Merger. Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue of $39.5 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 151% from $15.8 billion in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased 16% from $34.0 billion in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, 53% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 47% was from retail customers; this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 53% institutional and 47% retail on a historical basis and 52% institutional and 48% retail on a pro forma combined basis. In comparison with prior fiscal year pro forma combined results, sales to institutional customers increased by 19% primarily due to higher revenues from mail order facilities, ABSGs specialty pharmaceutical business and alternate site facilities. Sales to retail customers increased 14% over the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis, principally due to higher revenues from regional drug store chains, including the pharmacy departments of supermarkets. This segments growth largely reflects national industry economic conditions, including increases in prescription drug usage and higher pharmaceutical prices. Operating revenue increased 18% in the first half of the year and 14% in the second half of the year when compared to the same periods in the prior year on a pro forma combined basis as the Company reached the April 2002 anniversary date of the addition of a large mail order customer. Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit of $1,530.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 132% from $660.4 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased 9% from $1,405.0 million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 was 3.87%, as compared to prior fiscal year percentages of 4.19% on a historical basis and 4.13% on a pro forma combined basis. The year to year declines reflect the net impact of a number of factors, including the change in customer mix to a higher percentage of large institutional, mail order and chain accounts, and the continuing competitive pricing environment, offset, in part, by higher buy side margins than in the prior year. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating expenses of $871.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 126% from $386.2 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased 2% from $853.1 million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 were 2.20%, as compared to prior year percentages of 2.45% on a historical basis and 2.51% on a pro forma combined basis. These decreases in expense percentages reflect the changing customer mix described above, efficiencies of scale, the elimination of redundant costs through the merger integration process and the continued emphasis on productivity throughout the Companys distribution network. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income of $659.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 140% from $274.2 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and increased 19% from $551.8 million in the prior fiscal 26 year on a pro forma combined basis. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income was 1.67% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, as compared to prior year percentages of 1.74% on a historical basis and 1.62% on a pro forma combined basis. The improvement over the prior year pro forma combined percentage was due to a reduction in the operating expense ratio, which was greater than the reduction in gross profit margin. The reduction of the operating expense ratio was partially due to the Companys ability to capture synergy cost savings from the Merger. PharMerica Segment The PharMerica segment was acquired in connection with the Merger and the historical amounts for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 are comprised of only one month of PharMericas operating results. Accordingly, the discussion below focuses all comparisons with the prior year on a pro forma combined basis. PharMericas operating revenue increased 9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 to $1.48 billion compared to $1.35 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase is principally attributable to growth in PharMericas workers compensation business, which has grown at a faster rate than its long term care business. PharMericas gross profit of $494.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 4% from gross profit of $475.8 million in the prior fiscal year. PharMericas gross profit margin declined to 33.49% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 from 35.24% in the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily the result of a change in the sales mix, with a greater proportion of PharMericas current year revenues coming from its workers compensation business, which has lower gross profit margins and lower operating expenses than its long term care business. PharMericas operating expenses of $410.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 1% from operating expenses of $406.9 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses were reduced to 27.83% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 from 30.14% in the prior fiscal year. The percentage reduction is due to several factors, including the aforementioned shift in customer mix towards the workers compensation business, consolidation of technology platforms, the consolidation or sale of several pharmacies, and a reduction in bad debt expense. PharMericas operating income of $83.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 increased 21% compared to operating income of $68.9 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income was 5.66% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, an increase of 56 basis points from 5.10% in the prior fiscal year. The year to year improvement in the operating income percentage was due to the aforementioned reductions in the operating expense ratio, which were greater than the reductions in gross profit margin. Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to PharMerica. AmerisourceBergen Drug Company is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to PharMerica. Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing the Companys financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the Company through its pharmaceutical service activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. In determining the appropriate allowance, the Company considers a combination of factors, such as industry trends, its customers financial strength and credit standing, and payment and default history. The calculation of the required allowance requires a substantial amount of judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables. 27 Merchandise Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 94% and 96% of the Companys inventories at September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, is determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method. If the Company had used the first in, first out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $185.6 million and $152.3 million higher than the amounts reported at September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets as of October 1, 2001. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Accordingly, the Company ceased amortization of all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of October 1, 2001. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer lists, non compete agreements and software technology, will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. SFAS No. 142 requires a two step impairment test for goodwill. The first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step is required to be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The determination of the fair value of the Companys reporting units is based, among other things, on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued. The Company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually. Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2003 and 2002 and determined that there was no impairment. Stock Options The Company has the choice to account for stock options using either Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25) or SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The Company has elected to use the accounting method under APB 25 and the related interpretations to account for its stock options. Under APB 25, generally, when the exercise price of the Companys stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. Had the Company elected to use SFAS No. 123 to account for its stock options under the fair value method, it would have been required to record compensation expense and as a result, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 would have been lower by $0.16, $0.10 and $0.38, respectively. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table illustrates the Companys debt structure at September 30, 2003, including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility (in thousands): OutstandingBalance AdditionalAvailability Fixed Rate Debt: Bergen 7 1/4% senior notes due 2005 $ 99,849 $ 8 1/8% senior notes due 2008 500,000 7 1/4% senior notes due 2012 300,000 AmeriSource 5% convertible subordinated notes due 2007 300,000 Bergen 6 7/8% exchangeable subordinated debentures due 2011 8,425 Bergen 7.80% trust preferred securities due 2039 275,960 Other 4,920 Total fixed rate debt 1,489,154 Variable Rate Debt: Term loan facility due 2004 to 2006 240,000 Blanco revolving credit facility due 2004 55,000 Revolving credit facility due 2006 937,081 Receivables securitization facility due 2006 1,050,000 Total variable rate debt 295,000 1,987,081 Total debt, including current portion $ 1,784,154 $ 1,987,081 The Companys working capital usage fluctuates widely during the year due to seasonal inventory buying requirements and buy side purchasing opportunities. During fiscal 2003, the Companys highest utilization occurred during its third quarter and was 74% of the $2.1 billion of aggregate availability under its revolving credit facility and previously existing receivables securitization facilities. In July 2003, the Company entered into a new $1.05 billion receivables securitization facility (ABC Securitization Facility) and terminated the existing AmeriSource and Bergen securitization facilities. At September 30, 2003, there were no borrowings under the ABC Securitization Facility. In connection with the ABC Securitization Facility, ABDC sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to a wholly owned special purpose entity (ARFC), which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. ABDC is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the ABC Securitization Facility. After the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. Under the terms of the ABC Securitization Facility, a $550 million tranche has an expiration date of July 2006 (the three year tranche) and a $500 million tranche expires in July 2004 (the 364 day tranche). The Company intends to renew the 364 day tranche on an annual basis. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper plus a program fee of 75 basis points for the three year tranche and 45 basis points for the 364 day tranche. The Company pays a commitment fee of 30 basis points and 25 basis points on any unused credit with respect to the three year tranche and the 364 day tranche, respectively. The program and commitment fee rates will vary based on the Companys debt ratings. Borrowings and payments under the ABC Securitization Facility are applied on a pro rata basis to the $550 million and $500 million tranches. In connection with entering into the ABC Securitization Facility, the Company incurred approximately $2.4 million of costs which were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the ABC Securitization Facility. This facility is a financing vehicle utilized by the Company because it offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. The Company securitizes its trade accounts, which are generally non interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings under SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In November 2002, the Company issued $300 million of 7 1/4% senior notes due November 15, 2012 (the 7 1/4% Notes). The 7 1/4% Notes are redeemable at the Companys option at any time before maturity at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of redemption and, under some circumstances, a redemption premium. Interest on the 7 1/4% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears, 29 commencing May 15, 2003. The 7 1/4% Notes rank junior to the Senior Credit Agreement (defined below) and equal to the Companys 8 1/8% senior notes due 2008 and senior to the debt of the Companys subsidiaries. The Company used the net proceeds of the 7 1/4% Notes to repay $15 million of the Term Facility (defined below) in December 2002, to repay $150 million in aggregate principal of the Bergen 7 3/8% senior notes in January 2003 and to redeem the PharMerica 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes due 2008, at a redemption price equal to 104.19% of the $123.5 million principal amount, in April 2003. The cost of the redemption premium related to the PharMerica 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes has been reflected in the Companys consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 as a loss on the early retirement of debt. In connection with the issuance of the 7 1/4% Notes, the Company incurred approximately $5.7 million of costs which were deferred and are being amortized over the ten year term of the notes. In connection with the Merger, the Company issued $500 million of 8 1/8% senior notes due 2008 (the 8 1/8% Notes ) and entered into a $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility (the Senior Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders. Proceeds from these facilities were used to: replace existing AmeriSource and Bergen revolving credit facilities; pay certain merger transaction fees and fees associated with the financings; redeem $184.6 million of PharMerica 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes due 2008 via a tender offer; and meet general corporate purposes. In addition, the Company assumed $405.3 million of fixed debt. During fiscal 2002, the Company redeemed all $20.6 million of the Bergen 7% convertible subordinated debentures due 2006 pursuant to a tender offer required as a result of the Merger. The 8 1/8% Notes are redeemable at the Companys option at any time before maturity at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of redemption and, under some circumstances, a redemption premium. The 8 1/8% Notes pay interest semiannually in arrears and rank junior to the Senior Credit Agreement. The Senior Credit Agreement consists of a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $300 million term loan facility (the Term Facility), both maturing in August 2006. The Term Facility has scheduled principal payments on a quarterly basis that began on December 31, 2002, totaling $60 million in each of fiscal 2003 and 2004, and $80 million and $100 million in fiscal 2005 and 2006, respectively. The scheduled term loan payments were made in fiscal 2003. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility at September 30, 2003. Interest on borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement accrues at specified rates based on the Companys debt ratings. Such rates range from 1.0% to 2.5% over LIBOR or 0% to 1.5% over prime. In April 2003, the Companys debt rating was raised by one of the rating agencies and in accordance with the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement, interest on borrowings since April 2003 have accrued at lower rates. At September 30, 2003, the rate was 1.25% over LIBOR or .25% over prime. Availability under the Revolving Facility is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit ($62.9 million at September 30, 2003). The Company pays quarterly commitment fees to maintain the availability under the Revolving Facility at specified rates based on the Companys debt ratings ranging from 0.250% to 0.500% of the unused availability. At September 30, 2003, the rate was 0.300%. The Senior Credit Agreement contains restrictions on, among other things, additional indebtedness, distributions and dividends to stockholders, investments and capital expenditures. Additional covenants require compliance with financial tests, including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios, and maintenance of minimum tangible net worth. The Company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Senior Credit Agreement at any time. Substantially all of the Companys assets, except for trade receivables which were previously sold into the AmeriSource and Bergen receivables securitization facilities and currently are sold into the ABC Securitization Facility (as described above), collateralize the Senior Credit Agreement. In connection with issuing the 8 1/8% Notes and entering into the Senior Credit Agreement, the Company incurred approximately $24.0 million of costs, which were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the respective issues. In December 2000, the Company issued $300.0 million of 5% convertible subordinated notes due December 1, 2007. The notes have an annual interest rate of 5%, payable semiannually, and are convertible into common stock of the Company at $52.97 per share at any time before their maturity or their prior redemption or repurchase by the Company. On or after December 3, 2004, the Company has the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes that have not been previously converted. Net proceeds from the notes of approximately $290.6 million were used to repay existing borrowings, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. In connection with the issuance of the notes, the Company incurred approximately $9.4 million of financing fees, which were deferred and are being amortized over the seven year term of the notes. In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed Bergens Capital I Trust (the Trust), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bergen. In May 1999, the Trust issued 12,000,000 shares of 7.80% trust originated preferred securities (SM) (TOPrS(SM)) (the Trust Preferred Securities) at $25 per security. The proceeds of such issuances were invested by the Trust in $300 million aggregate principal amount of Bergens 7.80% subordinated deferrable interest notes due June 30, 2039 (the Subordinated Notes). The Subordinated Notes represent the sole assets of the Trust and bear interest at the annual rate of 7.80%, payable quarterly, and are redeemable by the Company beginning in May 2004 at 100% of the principal amount thereof. The Trust Preferred Securities will be redeemable upon any repayment of the Subordinated Notes at 100% of the liquidation amount 30 beginning in May 2004. The obligations of the Trust related to the Trust Preferred Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities are entitled to cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 7.80% of the liquidation amount of $25 per security. The Trust has continued to remit the required cash distributions since its inception. The Company, under certain conditions, may cause the Trust to defer the payment of distributions for successive periods of up to 20 consecutive quarters. During such periods, accrued distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities will compound quarterly at an annual rate of 7.80%. Also during such periods, the Company may not declare or pay distributions on its capital stock; may not redeem, purchase or make a liquidation payment on any of its capital stock; and may not make interest, principal or premium payments on, or repurchase or redeem, any of its debt securities that rank equal with or junior to the Subordinated Notes. The Companys operating results have generated sufficient cash flow which, together with borrowings under its debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt and the payment of interest on outstanding debt. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt and the payment of interest on debt, finance Merger integration initiatives and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund the Companys ongoing cash requirements. Following is a summary of the Companys contractual obligations for future principal payments on its debt, minimum rental payments on its noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on its other commitments at September 30, 2003 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Within 1year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5years Debt $ 1,808,345 $ 116,430 $ 281,396 $ 801,396 $ 609,123 Operating Leases 182,701 52,414 78,230 30,270 21,787 Other Commitments 90,875 87,295 2,229 1,351 Total $ 2,081,921 $ 256,139 $ 361,855 $ 833,017 $ 630,910 The debt amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the consolidated balance sheet due to the purchase accounting adjustments recorded in order to reflect Bergens obligations at fair value on the effective date of the Merger. These differences are being amortized over the terms of the respective obligations. The $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility, which expires in May 2004, is included in the Within 1 year column in the above repayment table. However, this borrowing is not classified in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2003 because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. Additionally, borrowings under the Blanco facility are secured by a standby letter of credit under the Senior Credit Agreement, and therefore the Company is effectively financing this debt on a long term basis through that arrangement. In connection with its merger integration plans, the Company intends to build six new distribution facilities and expand seven others (two of which are complete) over the next three to four years. Five of the new distribution facilities will be owned by the Company and, in December 2002, the Company entered into a 15 year lease obligation totaling $17.4 million for the other new facility; this obligation is reflected in Operating Leases in the above table. The Company has begun to enter into commitments relating to site selection, purchase of land, design and construction of the new facilities on a turnkey basis with a construction development company. As of September 30, 2003, the Company has entered into $87.0 million of commitments primarily relating to the construction of three new facilities. The Company will take ownership of and make payment on each new facility as the developer substantially completes construction. The facility commitments entered into as of September 30, 2003 are included in Other Commitments in the above table. As of September 30, 2003, the developer has incurred $25.6 million relating to the construction of the new facilities. This amount has been recorded in property and equipment and accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet. 31 Any outstanding contingent payments relating to recently acquired companies, as described below, are not reflected in the above table. These contingencies, along with any others, become commitments of the Company when they are realized. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Companys operating activities provided $354.8 million of cash. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 was principally the result of net income of $441.2 million and non cash items of $271.2 million, offset in part, by a $278.4 million increase in merchandise inventories and a $58.0 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in merchandise inventories reflects inventory required to support the revenue increase. Accounts receivable increased only by 1%, excluding changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer additions due to acquired companies, in comparison to the 13% increase in operating revenues. Average days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment increased slightly to 16.9 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 from 16.4 days in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the strong revenue growth of AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, which generally has a higher receivable investment than the core distribution business. Average days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment improved to 39.3 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 from 43.5 days in the prior fiscal year as a result of the continued improvements in centralized billing and collection practices. Non cash items of $271.2 million included $127.2 million of deferred income taxes. The tax planning strategies implemented by the Company has enabled the Company to lower its current tax payments and liability while increasing its deferred taxes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 included $134.2 million in interest payments and $118.4 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. During the year ended September 30, 2002, the Companys operating activities provided $535.9 million in cash. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2002 was principally the result of $344.9 million of net income and $190.0 million of non cash items affecting net income. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were only $1.0 million as a $362.2 million increase in merchandise inventories and a $133.6 million increase in accounts receivable were offset primarily by a $514.1 increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes. The increase in merchandise inventories reflects inventory required to support the strong revenue increase, as well as inventory purchased to take advantage of buy side gross profit opportunities including opportunities associated with manufacturer price increases and negotiated deals. Inventory grew at a lower rate than revenues due to the consolidation of seven facilities in fiscal 2002 and improved inventory management. Accounts receivable, before changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts, increased only 3%, despite the 16% increase in operating revenues, on a pro forma combined basis. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, the Companys days sales outstanding improved as a result of continued emphasis on receivables management at the local level. Average days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment improved to 16.4 days in fiscal 2002 from 17.7 days in the prior year, on a pro forma combined basis. Average days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment improved to 43.5 days in fiscal 2002 from 53.4 days in the prior year, on a pro forma combined basis. The $376.0 million increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the merchandise inventory increase as well as the timing of payments to suppliers. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 included $137.9 million in interest payments and $111.9 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. During the year ended September 30, 2001, the Companys operating activities used $45.9 million in cash. Cash used in operations in fiscal 2001 resulted from increases of $726.1 million in merchandise inventories and $151.6 million in accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of $613.3 million. The increase in merchandise inventories reflected necessary inventories to support the strong revenue increase, and inventory purchased to take advantage of buy side gross profit margin opportunities including opportunities associated with manufacturer price increases and negotiated deals. Additionally, inventories at September 30, 2001 included safety stock purchased due to uncertainties regarding possible increased customer demands or disruptions in the supply stream as the result of the terrorist events of September 11, 2001. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes is net of merger related payments of approximately $58.8 million, primarily executive compensation payments made in August 2001. The Company paid a total of $13.8 million, $15.6 million and $2.9 million of severance, contract, and lease cancellation and other costs in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to the cost reduction plans discussed above. Severance accruals of $4.9 million and remaining contract and lease obligations of $0.1 million at September 30, 2003 are included in accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the years ended September 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $90.6 million, $64.2 million and $23.4 million, respectively, and relate principally to investments in warehouse expansions and improvements, information technology and warehouse automation. The Company developed merger integration plans to consolidate its existing pharmaceutical distribution facility network and establish new, more efficient distribution centers. More specifically, the Companys plan is to have a distribution facility network consisting of 30 facilities, which will be accomplished by building six new facilities, expanding seven facilities, closing 27 facilities and implementing a new warehouse operating system. During fiscal 2003, a construction development company incurred $25.6 million on the Companys behalf relating to the construction of three 32 of the new facilities. This amount will be recorded as a capital expenditure when the related facilities are substantially complete, at which time, the Company will make payment to the construction development company and take ownership of each respective facility. The Company anticipates that future cash flows from operations along with existing availability under the revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility will be adequate to fund these merger integration plans. The Company expects to spend approximately $150 million to $200 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2004. In June 2003, the Company acquired Anderson Packaging Inc. (Anderson), a leading provider of physician and retail contracted packaging services to pharmaceutical manufacturers. The purchase price was approximately $100.1 million, which included the repayment of Anderson debt of $13.8 million and $0.8 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition. The Company paid part of the purchase price by issuing 814,145 shares of its common stock, as set forth in the acquisition agreement, with an aggregate market value of $55.6 million. The Company paid the remaining purchase price, which was approximately $44.5 million, in cash. In April 2003, the Company acquired an additional 40% equity interest in a physician education and management consulting company and satisfied the residual contingent obligation for the initial 20% equity interest for an aggregate $24.7 million in cash. The acquisition of the remaining 40% equity interest is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and the purchase price will be based on the calendar 2003 operating results of the physician education and management consulting company. An additional payment may be earned by the selling shareholders under the Companys current agreement with such shareholders based on the 2004 operating results of the physician education and management consulting company. The Company currently expects to pay between $30 million and $40 million, in the aggregate, for the remaining 40% equity interest and any additional payment. The Company also used cash of $3.0 million to purchase three smaller companies related to the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and paid $9.8 million to eliminate the right of the former owners of AutoMed Technologies, Inc. (AutoMed) to receive up to $55.0 million in contingent payments based on AutoMed achieving defined earnings targets through the end of calendar 2004. In January 2003, the Company acquired US Bioservices Corporation (US Bio), a national pharmaceutical products and services provider focused on the management of high cost complex therapies and reimbursement support for a total base purchase price of $160.2 million, which included the repayment of US Bio debt of $14.8 million and $1.5 million of transaction costs associated with this acquisition. The Company paid part of the base purchase price by issuing 2,399,091 shares of its common stock, as set forth in the acquisition agreement, with an aggregate market value of $131.0 million. The Company paid the remaining $29.2 million of the base purchase price in cash. The agreement also provides for contingent payments of up to $27.6 million in cash based on US Bio achieving defined earnings targets through the end of the first quarter of calendar 2004. In July 2003, an initial contingent payment of $2.5 million was paid in cash by the Company. In January 2003, the Company acquired Bridge Medical, Inc. (Bridge), a leading provider of barcode enabled point of care software designed to reduce medication errors, to enhance the Companys offerings in the pharmaceutical supply channel, for a total base purchase price of $28.4 million, which included $0.7 million of transaction costs associated with this acquisition. The Company paid part of the base purchase price by issuing 401,780 shares of its common stock with an aggregate market value of $22.9 million and the remaining base purchase price was paid with $5.5 million of cash. During fiscal 2002, the Company acquired AutoMed for $120.4 million. In June 2003, the Company amended the 2002 agreement under which it acquired AutoMed. The Company also acquired other smaller businesses for $15.8 million. Additionally, the Company purchased equity interests in various businesses for $4.1 million. During fiscal 2001, the Company sold the net assets of one of its specialty products distribution facilities for approximately $13.0 million. During fiscal 2000, the Company and three other healthcare distributors formed an Internet based company that is an independent, commercially neutral healthcare product information exchange focused on streamlining the process involved in identifying, purchasing and distributing healthcare products and services. The Company contributed $1.2 million and $6.5 million to the joint venture in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively, and its ownership interest of approximately 22% was accounted for under the equity method. This entity merged in November 2001 with the Global Health Exchange LLC, a similar venture, and the Companys ongoing ownership interest in the Global Health Exchange, LLC is 4%. Since then, the Company has accounted for its share of the joint venture using the cost method of accounting. 33 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company issued the aforementioned $300 million of 7 1/4% Notes. The Company used the net proceeds of the 7 1/4% Notes to repay $15 million of the term loan, to repay $150 million in aggregate principal of the Bergen 7 3/8% senior notes and redeem the PharMerica 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes due 2008 at a redemption price equal to 104.19% of the $123.5 million principal amount. The Company also repaid an additional $45 million of the term loan, as scheduled. During the year ended September 30, 2002, the Company made net repayments of $37.0 million on its receivables securitization facilities. The Company also repaid debt of $23.1 million during the year, principally consisting of $20.6 million for the retirement of Bergens 7% debentures pursuant to a tender offer which was required as a result of the Merger. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2001 primarily represents the net effect of borrowings to fund working capital requirements, the refinancing and merger costs described above. The Company has paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.025 per share on its common stock since the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Most recently, a dividend of $0.025 per share was declared by the board of directors on October 29, 2003, and was paid on December 1, 2003 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2003. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Companys board of directors and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Market Risk The Companys most significant market risk is the effect of changing interest rates. The Company manages this risk by using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. At September 30, 2003, the Company had approximately $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.2% and $295.0 million of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.6%. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the Companys working capital requirements. The Company periodically evaluates various financial instruments that could mitigate a portion of its exposure to variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. There were no such financial instruments in effect at September 30, 2003. For every $100 million of unhedged variable rate debt outstanding, a 26 basis point increase in interest rates (one tenth of the average variable rate at September 30, 2003) would increase the Companys annual interest expense by $0.26 million. Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This statement clarifies the definition of a liability, as currently defined by FASB Concepts Statement No. 6 Elements of Financial Statements, as well as other items. The statement requires that financial instruments that embody an obligation of an issuer be classified as a liability. Furthermore, the standard provides guidance for the initial and subsequent measurement as well as disclosure requirements of these financial instruments. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. This interpretation clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, and requires consolidation of variable interest entities by their primary beneficiaries if certain conditions are met. This interpretation applies to variable interest entities created or obtained after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or obtained before February 1, 2003, the adoption of this standard is effective as of December 31, 2003 for a variable interest in special purpose entities and as of March 31, 2004 for all other variable interest entities. The Company did not create or obtain any variable interest entity after January 31, 2003. The Company is in the process of evaluating the adoption of this standard, as it relates to variable interest entities held by the Company prior to February 1, 2003, but does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition to SFAS No. 123s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entitys accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. The adoption of the standard was effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. 34 The Company did not adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation. As required, the Company adopted the disclosure provisions of this standard. (See Notes 1 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This interpretation enhances the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The adoption of the initial recognition and measurement requirements of FIN No. 45 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements Certain of the statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and elsewhere in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.
