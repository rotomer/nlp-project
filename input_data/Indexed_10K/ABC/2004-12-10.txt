ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained herein. The Company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers, and substantially all of its operations are located in the United States. The Companys operations are comprised of two reportable segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica. Pharmaceutical Distribution The Pharmaceutical Distribution segment includes the operations of AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC) and the AmerisourceBergen Specialty, Packaging and Technology Groups. Servicing both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. The drug distribution operations of ABDC and AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group comprised over 90% of the segments operating revenue and operating income in fiscal 2004. ABDC is our wholesale drug distribution business and is currently organized into five regions across the United States. Unlike our more centralized competitors, we are structured as an organization of locally managed profit centers. We believe the delivery of healthcare is local and, therefore, the management of each distribution facility has responsibility for its own customer service and financial performance. These facilities utilize the Companys corporate staff for national and regional account management, marketing, data processing, finance, procurement, human resources, legal, executive management resources, and corporate coordination of asset and working capital management. The AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG or the Specialty Group), through a number of individual operating businesses, provides distribution and other services, including group purchasing services, to physicians and alternate care providers who specialize in a variety of disease states, including oncology, nephrology, and rheumatology. ABSG also distributes vaccines, other injectables and plasma. In addition, through its manufacturer services and physician and patient services businesses, ABSG provides a number of commercialization and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers, third party logistics, reimbursement consulting, practice management, and physician education. The AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group consists of American Health Packaging and Anderson Packaging (Anderson). American Health Packaging delivers unit dose, punch card, unit of use and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. Anderson is a leading provider of contracted packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers. The AmerisourceBergen Technology Group (ABTG) provides scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment and medication and supply dispensing cabinets to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. ABTG also provides barcode enabled point of care software designed to reduce medication errors and supply management software for institutional and retail healthcare providers designed to improve efficiency. 20 Table of Contents PharMerica The PharMerica segment includes the operations of the PharMerica long term care business (Long Term Care) and a workers compensation related business (Workers Compensation). PharMericas Long Term Care business is a leading national provider of pharmacy products and services to patients in long term care and alternate site settings, including skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and residential living communities. PharMericas Long Term Care institutional pharmacy business involves the purchase of bulk quantities of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals, principally from our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, and the distribution of those products to residents in long term care and alternate site facilities. Unlike hospitals, most long term and alternate care facilities do not have onsite pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs, but depend instead on institutional pharmacies, such as PharMerica Long Term Care, to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication. PharMericas Long Term Care pharmacies dispense pharmaceuticals in patient specific packaging in accordance with physician orders. In addition, PharMericas Long Term Care business provides infusion therapy services and Medicare Part B products, as well as formulary management and other pharmacy consulting services. PharMericas Workers Compensation business provides mail order and on line pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers compensation programs, and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors. Workers Compensation services include home delivery of prescription drugs, medical supplies and equipment and an array of computer software solutions to reduce the payors administrative costs. 21 Table of Contents AmerisourceBergen Corporation Summary Segment Information (dollars in thousands) Operating RevenueFiscal year ended September 30, 2004vs.2003Change 2003vs.2002Change 2004 2003 2002 Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 48,171,178 $ 44,731,200 $ 39,539,858 8 % 13 % PharMerica 1,575,255 1,608,203 1,475,028 (2 ) 9 Intersegment eliminations (875,818 ) (802,714 ) (774,172 ) (9 ) (4 ) Total $ 48,870,615 $ 45,536,689 $ 40,240,714 7 % 13 % (dollars in thousands) Operating IncomeFiscal year ended September 30, 2004vs.2003Change 2003vs.2002Change 2004 2003 2002 Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 738,100 $ 788,193 $ 659,208 (6 )% 20 % PharMerica 121,846 103,843 83,464 17 24 Facility consolidations and employee severance (7,517 ) (8,930 ) 16 Merger costs (24,244 ) Gain on litigation settlement 38,005 Total $ 890,434 $ 883,106 $ 718,428 1 % 23 % Percentages of operating revenue: Pharmaceutical Distribution Gross profit 3.45 % 3.85 % 3.87 % Operating expenses 1.92 % 2.09 % 2.20 % Operating income 1.53 % 1.76 % 1.67 % PharMerica Gross profit 30.45 % 32.69 % 33.49 % Operating expenses 22.72 % 26.23 % 27.83 % Operating income 7.74 % 6.46 % 5.66 % AmerisourceBergen Corporation Gross profit 4.46 % 4.93 % 5.03 % Operating expenses 2.64 % 3.00 % 3.25 % Operating income 1.82 % 1.94 % 1.79 % 22 Table of Contents Year ended September 30, 2004 compared with Year ended September 30, 2003 Consolidated Results Operating revenue, which excludes bulk deliveries, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 increased 7% to $48.9 billion from $45.5 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, offset slightly by a decline in operating revenue in the PharMerica segment. The Companys customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company changed its accounting policy for customer sales returns to reflect an accrual for estimated customer returns at the time of sale to the customer. Previously, the Company accounted for customer sales returns as a reduction of sales and cost of goods sold at the time of the return. As a result of this accounting policy change, operating revenue and cost of goods sold were each reduced by $316.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. Bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the Company at the express direction of the customer, and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers warehouse sites or shipments from the supplier to the Company for immediate shipment to the customers warehouse sites. Bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 increased 5% to $4.3 billion from $4.1 billion in the prior fiscal year due to an increase in demand from the Companys largest bulk customer. Due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries, fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins. However, revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the Companys cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the Company and payments by the Company to its suppliers. Gross profit of $2,179.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 decreased 3% from $2,247.2 million in the prior fiscal year. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company recognized a $38.0 million gain from an antitrust litigation settlement with a pharmaceutical manufacturer. This gain was recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and contributed 2% of gross profit for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 4.46%, as compared to the prior year percentage of 4.93%. The decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflects declines in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to a decline in profits related to pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases, changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures, offset in part by the antitrust litigation settlement. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization (DSAD&A) of $1,281.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a decrease of 5% compared to $1,355.1 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, DSAD&A in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 2.62% compared to 2.98% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in the DSAD&A percentage from the prior fiscal year reflects improvements in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to: (a) a $56.3 million reduction of bad debt expense primarily due to a $17.5 million recovery from a former customer in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, a $9.1 million recovery from a customer in the PharMerica segment, and the continued improvements made in the credit and collection practices in both segments; (b) a $12.1 million reduction in PharMericas sales and use tax liability; (c) a reduction in employee headcount resulting from our integration efforts; and (d) operational efficiencies primarily derived from our integration plans. In 2001, the Company developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions. As of September 30, 2004, these plans have resulted in synergies of approximately $150 million on an annual basis. The Companys plan, as revised, is to have a distribution facility network consisting of less than 30 facilities in the next two to three years. The plan includes building six new facilities (two of which are operational as of September 30, 2004) and closing facilities (seventeen of which have been closed). Construction activities on the remaining four new facilities are ongoing (two of which will be operational by the end of fiscal 2005). During fiscal 2004 and 2003, the Company closed four and six distribution facilities, respectively. The Company anticipates closing six additional facilities in fiscal 2005. 23 Table of Contents During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, the Company announced integration initiatives relating to the closure of a repackaging facility and the elimination of certain administrative functions, including the closure of a related office facility. The cost of these initiatives of approximately $19.2 million, which included $15.8 million of severance for approximately 310 employees to be terminated, $1.6 million for lease cancellation costs, and $1.8 million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed, resulted in additional goodwill being recorded during fiscal 2002. At September 30, 2004, all of the employees had been terminated. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company closed six distribution facilities and eliminated certain administrative and operational functions (the fiscal 2003 initiatives). During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $0.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of employee severance costs relating to the fiscal 2003 initiatives. Through September 30, 2004, approximately 780 employees received termination notices as a result of the fiscal 2003 initiatives, of which substantially all have been terminated. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, severance accruals of $1.8 million recorded in September 2001 were reversed into income because certain employees who were expected to be severed either voluntarily left the Company or were retained in other positions within the Company. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company closed four distribution facilities and eliminated duplicative administrative functions (the fiscal 2004 initiatives). During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company recorded $5.4 million of employee severance costs in connection with the termination of 230 employees relating to the fiscal 2004 initiatives. As of September 30, 2004, approximately 190 employees had been terminated. Additional amounts for integration initiatives will be recognized in subsequent periods as facilities to be consolidated are identified and specific plans are approved and announced. The Company paid a total of $9.5 million and $13.8 million for employee severance and lease and contract cancellation costs in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the aforementioned integration plans. Remaining unpaid amounts of $3.1 million for employee severance and lease cancellation costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2004. Most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time, generally not to exceed 12 months, while others may receive a lump sum payment. Operating income of $890.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was relatively flat compared to $883.1 million in the prior fiscal year. The gain on litigation settlement less costs of facility consolidations and employee severance increased the Companys operating income by $30.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 and costs of facility consolidations and employee severance reduced the Companys operating income by $8.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The Companys operating income as a percentage of operating revenue was 1.82% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 compared to 1.94% in the prior fiscal year. The gain on litigation settlement contributed approximately 8 basis points to the Companys operating income as a percentage of operating revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. The contribution provided by the litigation settlement was offset by a decrease in gross margin in excess of the aforementioned DSAD&A expense percentage reduction. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, a technology company in which the Company had an equity investment sold substantially all of its assets and paid a liquidating dividend. As a result, the Company recorded a gain of $8.4 million in other income during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company recorded losses of $8.0 million, which primarily consisted of a $5.5 million charge related to the decline in fair value of its equity investment in the technology company because the decline was judged to be other than temporary. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $23.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in losses resulting from the early retirement of debt (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Interest expense decreased 22% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 to $112.7 million from $144.7 million in the prior fiscal year. Average borrowings, net of cash, under the Companys debt facilities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 were $1.1 billion as compared to average borrowings, net of cash, of $2.3 billion in the prior fiscal year. The reduction in average borrowings, net of cash, was achieved due to lower inventory levels in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 due to the impact of inventory management agreements, reductions in buy side purchasing opportunities and the reduced number of distribution facilities as a result of the Companys integration activities. Income tax expense of $292.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects an effective income tax rate of 38.4%, versus 39.2% in the prior fiscal year. The Company has been able to lower its effective income tax rate during the current fiscal year by implementing tax planning strategies. 24 Table of Contents Net income of $468.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects an increase of 6% from $441.2 million in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share of $4.06 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a 4% increase as compared to $3.89 per share in the prior fiscal year. The gain on litigation settlement less costs of facility consolidations and employee severance and the loss on early retirement of debt increased net income by $4.2 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.04 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. Costs of facility consolidations and employee severance and the loss on early retirement of debt had the effect of decreasing net income by $8.0 million and reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.07 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. The growth in earnings per share was less than the growth in net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 due to the effect of the issuance of Company common stock in connection with the acquisitions described in Note 2 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and in connection with the exercise of stock options. Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue of $48.2 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects an increase of 8% from $44.7 billion in the prior fiscal year. The Companys change in accounting for customer sales returns had the effect of reducing operating revenue growth by 1% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, 59% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 41% was from sales to retail customers; this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 57% institutional and 43% retail. In comparison with prior year results, sales to institutional customers increased 12% in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the above market rate growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business and higher revenues from customers engaged in the mail order sale of pharmaceuticals, which was offset in part by the discontinuance of servicing the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 as a result of losing a competitive bid process. The VA contract was terminated in May 2004 and contributed 4.8% and 7.8% of the segments operating revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In March 2004, Caremark Rx, Inc. acquired Advance PCS, one of the Companys largest customers. As a result, the Companys contract with Advance PCS was terminated in August 2004. Advance PCS accounted for approximately 4.4% and 4.8% of the segments operating revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sales to retail customers increased 2% over the prior fiscal year. The independent retail sector experienced strong double digit sales growth while sales in the chain retail sector decreased by 6% due to sales declines experienced by certain large regional retail chain customers. Additionally, retail sales in the first half of fiscal 2004 were adversely impacted by the prior fiscal year loss of a large customer. This segments growth largely reflects U.S. pharmaceutical industry conditions, including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset, in part, by the increased use of lower priced generics. The segments growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix. Industry growth rates, as estimated by industry data firm IMS Healthcare, Inc., are expected to be from 10% to 13% over the next three years. Future operating revenue growth will continue to be driven by industry growth trends, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing policies, and potential changes in Federal government rules and regulations. The Companys Specialty Group has been growing at rates significantly in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth. The majority of this Groups revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, such as oncology, nephrology, and rheumatology. Additionally, the Specialty Group distributes vaccines and blood plasma. The Specialty Groups oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the Specialty Groups most significant contributor to revenue growth. As early as January 2005, the Specialty Groups business may be adversely impacted by proposed changes in the reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, including oncology drugs. The reimbursement changes recently proposed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Modernization Act), or that may be proposed in the future, may have the effect of reducing the amount of medications administered by physicians in their offices, which may force patients to other healthcare providers. This may result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for the Specialty Group. Although the Specialty Group is preparing contingency plans to enable it to retain its distribution volume, there can be no assurance that the Specialty Group will retain all of the distribution volume currently going through the physician channel. 25 Table of Contents Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit of $1,661.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a decrease of 3% from $1,721.5 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 3.45%, as compared to 3.85% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue was the result of: a reduction in profits related to pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases; the VA contract loss; the continuing competitive environment, which has led to a number of contract renewals with reduced profitability; and the negative impact of a change in customer mix to a higher percentage of large institutional, mail order and chain accounts. Downward pressures on sell side gross profit margin are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that increases in the buy side component of the gross margin, including increases derived from manufacturer price increases, negotiated deals and alternate source market opportunities, will be available in the future to fully or partially offset the anticipated decline of the sell side margin. The Company expects that buy side purchasing opportunities will continue to decrease in the future as pharmaceutical manufacturers increasingly seek to control the supply channel through product allocations that limit the inventory the Company can purchase and through the imposition of inventory management and other agreements that prohibit or restrict the Companys right to purchase inventory from alternate source suppliers. Although the Company seeks in any such agreements to obtain appropriate compensation from pharmaceutical manufacturers for foregoing buy side purchasing opportunities, there can be no assurance that the agreements will function as intended and replace any or all lost profit opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of the Companys payments under current pharmaceutical manufacturer agreements are triggered by pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases. These may lead to significant earnings volatility. Although the Company is negotiating with pharmaceutical manufacturers to change the payment trigger and lessen its dependence on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in transforming its relationships to a fee for service structure from their current structure. The Companys cost of goods sold includes a last in, first out (LIFO) provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating expenses of $923.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflect a decrease of 1% from $933.3 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 were 1.92%, as compared to 2.09% in the prior fiscal year, an improvement of 17 basis points. The decrease in the expense percentage reflects the changing customer mix described above, efficiencies of scale, the elimination of redundant costs through the integration processes, continued emphasis on productivity throughout the Companys distribution network, and a significant reduction in bad debt expense of $33.9 million (including a $17.5 million reduction of a previously recorded allowance for doubtful account as a result of a settlement with a former customer). Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income of $738.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a decrease of 6% from $788.2 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 1.53%, as compared to 1.76% in the prior fiscal year. The decline over the prior year percentage was due to a reduction in gross margins in excess of the declines in the operating expense ratios. While management historically has been able to lower expense ratios there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future, or that expense ratio reductions will offset possible declines in gross margins. PharMerica Segment PharMerica operating revenue of $1,575.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a decrease of 2% from $1,608.2 million in the prior fiscal year. PharMericas decline in operating revenue is primarily due to the loss of two significant customers in the Workers Compensation business, the discontinuance of the sale of healthcare products within the Long Term Care business and the loss of a Long Term Care business customer because it was acquired by a customer of a competitor. The future operating revenue growth rate may be impacted by competitive pressures, changes in the regulatory environment (including reimbursement changes arising from the Medicare Modernization Act) and the pharmaceutical inflation rate. PharMerica gross profit of $479.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a decrease of 9% from $525.6 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 30.45%, as compared to 32.69% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in gross profit is primarily due to industry competitive pressures, and a reduction in the rates of reimbursement for the services provided by PharMerica, which continue to adversely affect gross profit margins in both the Workers Compensation business and the Long Term Care business. 26 Table of Contents PharMerica operating expenses of $357.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflect a decrease of 15% from $421.8 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses were reduced to 22.72% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 from 26.23% in the prior fiscal year. The percentage reduction was primarily due to aggressive cost reductions in response to the decline in operating revenue, a significant reduction in bad debt expense of $22.4 million (including a $9.1 million recovery from a customer) due to continued improvements made in credit and collection practices, a $12.1 million reduction in sales and use tax liability due to favorable audit experience and other settlements, and continued improvements in operating practices of both the Workers Compensation and the Long Term Care businesses. PharMerica operating income of $121.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 increased by 17% from $103.8 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 7.74%, as compared to 6.46% in the prior fiscal year. The improvement was due to the aforementioned reduction in the operating expense ratio, which was greater than the reduction in gross profit margin. While management historically has been able to lower expense ratios there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future, or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible further declines in gross margins. Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to PharMerica. ABDC is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to PharMerica. Year ended September 30, 2003 compared with Year ended September 30, 2002 Consolidated Results Operating revenue, which excludes bulk deliveries, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 increased 13% to $45.5 billion from $40.2 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. Bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 decreased 17% to $4.1 billion from $5.0 billion in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to the Companys conversion of a portion of its bulk and other direct business with its primary bulk delivery customer to business serviced through the Companys various warehouses. Due to the insignificant service fees generated from these bulk deliveries, fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins. However, revenue from bulk deliveries had a positive impact to the Companys cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the Company and the payments by the Company to its suppliers. Gross profit of $2,247.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflected an increase of 11% from $2,024.5 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 was 4.93%, as compared to the prior year percentage of 5.03%. The decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflected declines in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments primarily due to changes in customer mix and competitive pressures, offset in part by the positive aggregate margin impact resulting from the Companys recent acquisitions. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization (DSAD&A) of $1,355.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflected an increase of 6% compared to $1,281.8 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, DSAD&A in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 was 2.98% compared to 3.19% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in DSAD&A percentage from the prior fiscal year ratio reflected improvements in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to customer mix changes, operational efficiencies and continued benefits from the integration plans. In 2001, the Company developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions, which resulted in synergies of approximately $150 million on an annual basis. The Companys plan, as revised, is to have a distribution facility network consisting of less than 30 facilities in the next two to three years. This will be accomplished by building six new facilities and closing facilities. During fiscal 2003, the Company began construction activities on three of its new facilities and completed two of the seven facility expansions. During fiscal 2003 and 2002, the Company closed six and seven distribution facilities, respectively. 27 Table of Contents In September 2001, the Company announced plans to close seven distribution facilities in fiscal 2002, consisting of six former AmeriSource facilities and one former Bergen facility. A charge of $10.9 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 related to the AmeriSource facilities, and included $6.2 million of severance for approximately 260 warehouse and administrative personnel to be terminated, $2.3 million in lease and contract cancellations, and $2.4 million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed. Approximately $0.2 million of costs related to the Bergen facility were included in the merger purchase price allocation. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, severance accruals of $1.8 million recorded in September 2001 were reversed into income because certain employees who were expected to be severed either voluntarily left the Company or were retained in other positions within the Company. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, the Company announced further integration initiatives relating to the closure of Bergens repackaging facility and the elimination of certain Bergen administrative functions, including the closure of a related office facility. The cost of these initiatives of approximately $19.2 million, which included $15.8 million of severance for approximately 310 employees to be terminated, $1.6 million for lease cancellation costs, and $1.8 million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed, resulted in additional goodwill being recorded during fiscal 2002. The Company had announced plans to close six distribution facilities in fiscal 2003 and eliminate certain administrative and operational functions (the fiscal 2003 initiatives). As of September 30, 2003, the six facilities were closed. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company recorded severance costs of $10.3 million and lease cancellation costs of $1.1 million relating to the fiscal 2003 initiatives. The Company paid a total of $13.8 million and $15.6 million for employee severance and lease and contract cancellation costs in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to the aforementioned integration plans. Remaining unpaid amounts of $5.0 million for employee severance and lease cancellation costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2003. Most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time, generally not to exceed 12 months, while others may receive a lump sum payment. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, the Company expensed approximately $24.2 million of merger costs, primarily related to integrating the operations of AmeriSource and Bergen. Such costs were comprised primarily of consulting fees, which amounted to $16.6 million. The merger costs also included a $2.1 million adjustment to the Companys fourth quarter 2001 charge of $6.5 million relating to the accelerated vesting of AmeriSource stock options. Effective October 1, 2002, the Company converted its merger integration office to an operations management office. Accordingly, the costs of the operations management office are included within distribution, selling and administrative expenses in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. Operating income of $883.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflected an increase of 23% from $718.4 million in the prior fiscal year. Facility consolidations and employee severance reduced the Companys operating income by $8.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 and by $24.2 million in the prior fiscal year. The Companys operating income as a percentage of operating revenue was 1.94% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 compared to 1.79% in the prior fiscal year. The improvement was primarily due to the lower amount of special items and the aforementioned DSAD&A expense percentage reduction. The Company recorded other losses of $8.0 million and $5.6 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These amounts primarily consisted of impairment charges relating to investments in technology companies. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company recorded a $4.2 million loss resulting from the early retirement of debt (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Interest expense increased 3% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 to $144.7 million from $140.7 million in the prior fiscal year. Average borrowings, net of cash, under the Companys debt facilities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 were $2.3 billion as compared to average borrowings, net of cash, of $2.0 billion in the prior fiscal year. Average borrowing rates under the Companys debt facilities decreased to 5.6% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 from 6.1% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in average borrowings, net of cash, was primarily a result of additional merchandise inventories on hand during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in average borrowing rates resulted from lower percentages of fixed rate debt outstanding to total debt outstanding in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as lower market interest rates on variable rate debt. 28 Table of Contents Income tax expense of $284.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflected an effective income tax rate of 39.2% versus 39.7% in the prior fiscal year. The Company has been able to lower its effective income tax rate during the current fiscal year by implementing tax planning strategies. Net income of $441.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflected an increase of 28% from $344.9 million in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share of $3.89 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflected a 23% increase as compared to $3.16 per share in the prior fiscal year. Facility consolidations and employee severance and the loss on early retirement of debt had the effect of decreasing net income by $8.0 million and reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.07 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. Merger costs had the effect of decreasing net income by $14.6 million and reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.13 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002. The growth in earnings per share was less than the growth in net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 due to the issuance of Company common stock in connection with the acquisitions described in Note 2 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and in connection with the exercise of stock options. Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue of $44.7 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflected an increase of 13% from $39.5 billion in the prior fiscal year. The Companys recent acquisitions contributed less than 0.5% of the segment operating revenue growth for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, 57% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 43% was from retail customers; this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 53% institutional and 47% retail on a historical basis. In comparison with the prior year results, sales to institutional customers increased by 20% primarily due to (i) the previously mentioned conversion of bulk delivery and other direct business with the Companys primary bulk delivery customer to business serviced through the Companys various warehouses, which contributed 4% of the total operating revenue growth; (ii) above market rate growth of the ABSG specialty pharmaceutical business; and (iii) higher revenues from customers engaged in the mail order sale of pharmaceuticals. Sales to retail customers increased by 5% over the prior fiscal year. The growth rate of sales to retail customers had declined during fiscal 2003 compared to the fiscal 2002 growth primarily due to lower growth trends in the retail market and the below market growth of certain of the Companys large regional chain customers. Additionally, retail sales in the second half of fiscal 2003 were adversely impacted by the loss of a large customer. This segments growth largely reflected U.S. pharmaceutical industry conditions, including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices, offset, in part, by the increased use of lower priced generics. The segments growth was also impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix. Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit of $1,721.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflected an increase of 12% from $1,530.5 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 was 3.85%, as compared to 3.87% in the prior fiscal year. The slight decline in gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue was the net result of the negative impact of a change in customer mix to a higher percentage of large institutional, mail order and chain accounts, and the continuing competitive environment, offset primarily by the positive aggregate impact of recently acquired companies, which amounted to 15 basis points in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. The Companys cost of goods sold includes a LIFO provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating expenses of $933.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflected an increase of 7% from $871.3 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 were 2.09%, as compared to 2.20% in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in the expense percentage reflects the changing customer mix described above, efficiencies of scale, the elimination of redundant costs through the merger integration process, the continued emphasis on productivity throughout the Companys distribution network and a reduction of bad debt expense, offset, in part, by higher expense ratios associated with the Companys recent acquisitions. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income of $788.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 reflected an increase of 20% from $659.2 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 was 1.76%, as compared to 1.67% in the prior fiscal year. The improvement over the prior year percentage was due to a reduction in the operating expense ratio in excess of the decline in gross margin, which was partially the result of the Companys ability to capture synergy cost savings from the merger. 29 Table of Contents PharMerica Segment PharMerica operating revenue increased 9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 to $1,608.2 million compared to $1,475.0 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase was principally attributable to growth in PharMericas Workers Compensation business, which grew at a faster rate than its Long Term Care business. During the second half of fiscal 2003, the growth rate of the Workers Compensation business began to slow down, partially due to the loss of a significant customer. PharMerica gross profit of $525.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 increased 6% from gross profit of $494.0 million in the prior fiscal year. PharMericas gross profit margin declined slightly to 32.69% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 from 33.49% in the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily the result of a change in the sales mix, with a greater proportion of PharMericas current year revenues coming from its Workers Compensation business, which has lower gross profit margins and lower operating expenses than its Long Term Care business. In addition, industry competitive pressures adversely affected gross profit margins. PharMerica operating expenses of $421.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 increased from $410.5 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses were reduced to 26.23% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 from 27.83% in the prior fiscal year. The percentage reduction was primarily due to the continued improvements in operating practices, the aforementioned shift in customer mix toward the Workers Compensation business and a reduction in bad debt expense. PharMerica operating income of $103.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 increased by 24% from $83.5 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 was 6.46%, as compared to 5.66% in the prior fiscal year. The improvement was due to the aforementioned reduction in the operating expense ratio, which was greater than the reduction in gross profit margin. Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to PharMerica. AmerisourceBergen Drug Company is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to PharMerica. Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing the Companys financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the Company for its pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers a combination of factors, such as industry trends, its customers financial strength and credit standing, and payment and default history. The calculation of the required allowance requires a substantial amount of judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables. Supplier Reserves The Company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due them from the Company. These reserve estimates are established based on the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to the Company. The ultimate outcome of the outstanding claims may be different than the Companys original estimate and may require adjustment. 30 Table of Contents Loss Contingencies The Company accrues for loss contingencies related to litigation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The Company regularly reviews loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates. Merchandise Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 92% and 94% of the Companys inventories at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method. If the Company had used the first in, first out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $166.1 million and $169.4 million higher than the amounts reported at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships, non compete agreements and software technology, will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives under SFAS No. 142, a determination of the fair value of the Companys reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based, among other things, on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued. The Company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, and record any resulting impairment losses annually. Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2004 and 2003 and determined that there was no impairment. Stock Options The Company may elect to account for stock options using either Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB 25) or SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The Company has elected to use the accounting method under APB 25 and the related interpretations to account for its stock options. Under APB 25, generally, when the exercise price of the Companys stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. Had the Company elected to use SFAS No. 123 to account for its stock options under the fair value method, it would have been required to record compensation expense and as a result, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 would have been lower by $0.74, $0.16 and $0.10, respectively. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table illustrates the Companys debt structure at September 30, 2004, including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility (in thousands): OutstandingBalance AdditionalAvailability Fixed Rate Debt: Bergen 7 1/4% senior notes due 2005 $ 99,939 $ 8 1/8% senior notes due 2008 500,000 7 1/4% senior notes due 2012 300,000 AmeriSource 5% convertible subordinated notes due 2007 300,000 Other 3,532 Total fixed rate debt 1,203,471 Variable Rate Debt: Term loan facility due 2005 to 2006 180,000 Blanco revolving credit facility due 2005 55,000 Revolving credit facility due 2006 936,584 Receivables securitization facility due 2006 1,050,000 Total variable rate debt 235,000 1,986,584 Total debt $ 1,438,471 $ 1,986,584 Prior to fiscal 2004, the Companys working capital usage fluctuated significantly during the fiscal year due to seasonal inventory buying requirements and buy side purchasing opportunities. In light of the recent increase in the number of inventory management agreements with suppliers, the Companys working capital did not significantly fluctuate in fiscal 2004. The Companys $2.1 billion of aggregate availability under its revolving credit facility and its receivables securitization facility provide sufficient sources of capital to fund its inventory buying requirements. On December 2, 2004, the Company amended its Receivables Securitization Facility (defined below). Under the terms of the amendment, the $550 million (three year tranche) originally scheduled to expire in July 2006 was increased to $700 million (three year tranche) and expires in December 2007. Additionally, the $500 million (364 day tranche) scheduled to expire in July 2005 was reduced to $350 million (364 day tranche) and expires in December 2005. The Company intends to renew the 364 day tranche on an annual basis. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper plus a program fee. The program fee is 75 basis points for the three year tranche and has been reduced from 45 basis points to 35 basis points for the 364 day tranche at December 2, 2004. Additionally, the commitment fee on any unused credit has been reduced from 30 basis points to 25 basis points for the three year tranche and from 25 basis points to 17.5 basis points for the 364 day tranche at December 2, 2004. The program and commitment fee rates will vary based on the Companys debt ratings. In July 2003, the Company entered into a $1.05 billion receivables securitization facility (Receivables Securitization Facility). At September 30, 2004, there were no borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility. In connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, ABDC sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to a wholly owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. ABDC is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. After the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. In connection with entering into the Receivables Securitization Facility, the Company incurred approximately $2.4 million of costs, which were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the facility. The facility is a financing vehicle utilized by the Company because it offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. The Company securitizes its trade accounts, which are generally non interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings under SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. 32 Table of Contents In November 2002, the Company issued $300 million of 7 1/4% senior notes due November 15, 2012 (the 7 1/4% Notes). The 7 1/4% Notes are redeemable at the Companys option at any time before maturity at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of redemption and, under some circumstances, a redemption premium. Interest on the 7 1/4% Notes is payable semiannually in arrears, commencing May 15, 2003. The 7 1/4% Notes rank junior to the Senior Credit Agreement (defined below) and equal to the Companys 8 1/8% senior notes due 2008 and senior to the debt of the Companys subsidiaries. The Company used the net proceeds of the 7 1/4% Notes to repay $15 million of the Term Facility (defined below) in December 2002, to repay $150 million in aggregate principal of the Bergen 7 3/8% senior notes in January 2003 and to redeem the PharMerica 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes due 2008, at a redemption price equal to 104.19% of the $123.5 million principal amount, in April 2003. The cost of the redemption premium related to the PharMerica 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes has been reflected in the Companys consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 as a loss on the early retirement of debt. In connection with the issuance of the 7 1/4% Notes, the Company incurred approximately $5.7 million of costs which were deferred and are being amortized over the ten year term of the notes. In August 2001, the Company issued $500 million of 8 1/8% senior notes due 2008 (the 8 1/8% Notes) and entered into a $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility (the Senior Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders. The 8 1/8% Notes are redeemable at the Companys option at any time before maturity at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of redemption and, under some circumstances, a redemption premium. The 8 1/8% Notes pay interest semiannually in arrears and rank junior to the Senior Credit Agreement. In connection with issuing the 8 1/8% Notes and entering into the Senior Credit Agreement, the Company incurred approximately $24.0 million of costs, which were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the respective issues. On December 2, 2004, the Company entered into a new $700 million five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Senior Revolving Credit Facility) with a syndicate of lenders. The Senior Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Senior Credit Agreement (defined below). Interest on borrowings under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specific rates based on the Companys debt rating (1.0% over LIBOR or the prime rate at December 2, 2004). The Company will pay quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility at specific rates based on the Companys debt rating (0.25% at December 2, 2004). The Company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Senior Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions on, among other things, additional indebtedness, distributions and dividends to stockholders, investments and capital expenditures. Additional covenants require compliance with financial tests, including leverage and minimum earnings to fixed charges ratios. The Senior Credit Agreement consisted of a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $300 million term loan facility (the Term Facility), both had been scheduled to mature in August 2006. The Term Facility had scheduled principal payments on a quarterly basis that began on December 31, 2002, totaling $60 million in each of fiscal 2003 and 2004, and $80 million and $100 million in fiscal 2005 and 2006, respectively. The scheduled term loan payments were made in fiscal 2004 and 2003. Additionally, the Company paid the $180 million outstanding on the Term Facility as a result of entering into the new Senior Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility at September 30, 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement accrued at specified rates based on the Companys debt ratings. Such rates ranged from 1.0% to 2.5% over LIBOR or 0% to 1.5% over prime. At September 30, 2004, the rate was 1.25% over LIBOR or 0.25% over prime. Availability under the Revolving Facility was reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit ($63.4 million at September 30, 2004). The Company paid quarterly commitment fees to maintain the availability under the Revolving Facility at specified rates based on the Companys debt ratings ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% of the unused availability. At September 30, 2004, the rate was 0.30%. The Senior Credit Agreement contained restrictions on, among other things, additional indebtedness, distributions and dividends to stockholders, investments and capital expenditures. Additional covenants required compliance with financial tests, including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios, and maintenance of minimum tangible net worth. Substantially all of the Companys assets, except for trade receivables, which are sold into the Receivables Securitization Facility (as described above), were pledged as security under the Senior Credit Agreement. In August 2004, the Senior Credit Agreement was amended, among other things, to increase the amount of common stock that the Company is permitted to repurchase by $500 million. As of September 30, 2004, the Company had purchased approximately 2.8 million shares of its common stock for a total of $144.8 million. As of November 30, 2004, the Company had purchased 7.6 million total shares for $397.9 million. In December 2000, the Company issued $300.0 million of 5% convertible subordinated notes due December 1, 2007. The notes have an annual interest rate of 5%, payable semiannually, and are convertible into common stock of the Company at $52.97 per share at any time before their maturity or their prior redemption or repurchase by the Company. On or after 33 Table of Contents December 3, 2004, the Company has the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes that have not been previously converted. On December 2, 2004, the Company announced that it will redeem its 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of 102.143% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest through the redemption date of January 3, 2005. The note holders have the option to accept cash or convert the notes to common stock of the Company. The notes are convertible into 5,663,730 shares of common stock, which translates to a conversion ratio of 18.8791 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of notes. In connection with the issuance of the notes, the Company incurred approximately $9.4 million of financing fees, which were deferred and are being amortized over the seven year term of the notes. In August 2001, the Company assumed Bergens Capital I Trust (the Trust), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bergen. In May 1999, the Trust issued 12,000,000 shares of 7.80% trust originated preferred securities (SM) (TOPrS(SM)) (the Trust Preferred Securities) at $25 per security. The proceeds of such issuances were invested by the Trust in $300 million aggregate principal amount of Bergens 7.80% subordinated deferrable interest notes, which were due June 30, 2039 (the Subordinated Notes). The Subordinated Notes represented the sole assets of the Trust and bore interest at the annual rate of 7.80%, payable quarterly, and were redeemable by the Company beginning in May 2004 at 100% of the principal amount thereof. In May 2004, the Company redeemed the Subordinated Notes at their face value of $300 million and, as a result, the Trust redeemed the Trust Preferred Securities at the liquidation amount of $25 per share plus accrued cash distributions through the redemption date. The book value of the Subordinated Notes was $276.4 million immediately prior to the redemption. The book value of the Subordinated Notes was less than the $300 million face value because the book value was previously adjusted to its fair market value in August 2001. Therefore, the Company incurred a loss of $23.6 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 as a result of the redemption of the Subordinated Notes. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding Bergen 6 7/8% exchangeable subordinated debentures at their carrying value of $8.4 million. The Companys operating results have generated sufficient cash flow which, together with borrowings under its debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt and repurchase of shares of the Companys common stock. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt and the payment of interest on debt, fund additional repurchases of shares of the Companys common stock, finance merger integration initiatives and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund the Companys ongoing cash requirements. Following is a summary of the Companys contractual obligations for future principal payments on its debt, minimum rental payments on its noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on its other commitments at September 30, 2004 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Within 1year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Debt $ 1,438,532 $ 336,421 $ 1,406 $ 800,705 $ 300,000 Operating Leases 197,194 58,177 79,080 38,119 21,818 Other Commitments 1,295,206 120,840 157,644 235,615 781,107 Total $ 2,930,932 $ 515,438 $ 238,130 $ 1,074,439 $ 1,102,925 The debt amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the consolidated balance sheet due to the purchase accounting adjustments recorded in order to reflect obligations at fair value on the effective date of the acquisition. These differences are being amortized over the terms of the respective obligations. The $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility, which expires in May 2005, is included in the Within 1 year column in the above repayment table. However, this borrowing is not classified in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2004 because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. Additionally, borrowings under the Blanco facility are secured by a standby letter of credit under the Senior Credit Agreement, and therefore the Company is effectively financing this debt on a long term basis through that arrangement. 34 Table of Contents On December 3, 2004, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with a Canadian influenza vaccine manufacturer to distribute product through March 31, 2015. The agreement includes a commitment to purchase at least 12 million doses per year of the influenza vaccine provided the vaccine is approved and available for distribution in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Company will be required to purchase the annual doses at market prices, as adjusted for inflation and other factors. The Canadian manufacturer expects to receive FDA approval by the year 2007/2008 influenza season; however, FDA approval may be received earlier. If the initial year of the purchase commitment begins in fiscal 2008, then the Company anticipates its purchase commitment for that year will approximate $104 million. Based on an assumed 5% annual increase in the cost of purchasing the influenza vaccine from the current estimated market price of $7.50, the Company anticipates its total purchase commitment (assuming the commitment commences in fiscal 2008) will be approximately $1.0 billion. The influenza vaccine commitment is included in Other Commitments in the table on page 34. The Company has an agreement with another supplier to purchase 9.2 million doses, 10.2 million doses, and 11.2 million doses of an influenza vaccine in calendar years 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively, provided the vaccine is approved and available for distribution. The Company estimates its total purchase commitment as of September 30, 2004 is approximately $225 million. The influenza vaccine commitment is included in Other Commitments in the table on page 34. In connection with its integration plans, the Company intends to build six new distribution facilities (two of them are operational as of September 30, 2004) over the next two to three years. Five of the new distribution facilities will be owned by the Company. In December 2002, the Company entered into a 15 year lease obligation totaling $17.4 million for the other new facility; this obligation is reflected in Operating Leases in the above table. The Company has been entering into commitments relating to site selection, purchase of land, design and construction of the five new facilities to be owned on a turnkey basis with a construction development company. The Company has taken ownership of and made payment on, or will take ownership of and make payment on, four of the five new facilities to be owned as the developer substantially completes construction of each facility. The Company has taken ownership of the land and construction in progress relating to the fifth facility to be owned prior to its substantial completion. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company acquired two of the five new facilities from the construction development company for approximately $40.9 million. As of September 30, 2004, the Company has entered into $71.7 million of commitments primarily relating to the construction of the three remaining facilities. The facility commitments entered into as of September 30, 2004 are included in Other Commitments in the above table. As of September 30, 2004, the developer has incurred $35.1 million relating to the construction of these facilities. This amount has been recorded in property and equipment and accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet. Subsequent to September 30, 2004, two of the facilities were substantially completed and the Company acquired them from the construction development company for approximately $43.6 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Companys operating activities provided $825.1 million of cash. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2004 was principally the result of a decrease in merchandise inventories of $916.3 million, net income of $468.4 million and non cash items of $151.5 million, offset in part, by a $432.0 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes. The Companys change in accounting for customer sales returns had the effect of increasing merchandise inventories and reducing accounts receivable by $316.8 million at September 30, 2004. Merchandise inventories have continued to decline due to an increase in the number of inventory management agreements, a reduction in buy side profit opportunities, and a reduction in the number of distribution facilities. The turnover of merchandise inventories for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment has improved to 8.2 times in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 from 6.7 times in the prior fiscal year. The $446.7 million decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the decline of merchandise inventories. Average days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment increased slightly to 17.1 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 from 16.9 days in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the strong revenue growth of ABSG, which has a significantly higher average days sales outstanding than ABDC. Average days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment improved to 38.4 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 from 39.3 days in the prior fiscal year as a result of the continued emphasis on receivables management. Non cash items of $151.5 million included $87.1 million of depreciation and amortization and $48.9 million of deferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes of $48.9 million in fiscal 2004 were significantly lower than the $127.2 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to the decline in income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 included $111.0 million in interest payments and $200.1 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Cash provided by operations during the fiscal year 35 Table of Contents ended September 30, 2004 included a $38.0 million cash settlement from a pharmaceutical manufacturer relating to an antitrust litigation matter (net of attorney fees and payments due to other parties). During the year ended September 30, 2003, the Companys operating activities provided $354.8 million in cash. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 was principally the result of net income of $441.2 million and non cash items of $271.2 million, offset in part, by a $278.4 million increase in merchandise inventories and a $58.0 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in merchandise inventories reflected inventory required to support the revenue increase. Accounts receivable increased only 1%, excluding changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer additions due to acquired companies, in comparison to the 13% increase in operating revenues. Average days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment increased slightly to 16.9 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 from 16.4 days in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the strong revenue growth of AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, which generally has a higher receivable investment than the core distribution business. Average days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment improved to 39.3 days in fiscal 2002 from 43.5 days in the prior year as a result of the continued improvements in centralized billing and collection practices. Non cash items of $271.2 million included $127.2 million of deferred income taxes. The tax planning strategies implemented by the Company enabled the Company to lower its current tax payments and liability while increasing its deferred taxes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 included $134.2 million in interest payments and $118.4 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. During the year ended September 30, 2002, the Companys operating activities provided $535.9 million in cash. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2002 was principally the result of $344.9 million of net income and $190.0 million of non cash items affecting net income. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were only $1.0 million as a $362.2 million increase in merchandise inventories and a $133.6 million increase in accounts receivable were offset primarily by a $514.1 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes. The increase in merchandise inventories reflected inventory required to support the strong revenue increase, as well as inventory purchased to take advantage of buy side gross profit opportunities including opportunities associated with manufacturer price increases and negotiated deals. Inventory grew at a lower rate than revenues due to the consolidation of seven facilities in fiscal 2002 and improved inventory management. Accounts receivable, before changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts, increased only 3%, despite the 16% increase in operating revenues, on a pro forma combined basis. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, the Companys days sales outstanding improved as a result of continued emphasis on receivables management at the local level. Average days outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment improved to 16.4 days in fiscal 2002 from 17.7 days in the prior year, on a pro forma combined basis. Average days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment improved to 43.5 days in fiscal 2002 from 53.4 days in the prior year, on a pro forma combined basis. The $376.0 million increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the merchandise inventory increase as well as the timing of payments to suppliers. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 included $137.9 million in interest payments and $111.9 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. The Company paid a total of $9.5 million, $13.8 million and $15.6 million of employee severance, lease cancellation, and other costs in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to the cost reduction plans discussed earlier. Severance accruals and remaining contract and lease obligations of $3.1 million at September 30, 2004 are included in accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $189.3 million, $90.6 million and $64.2 million, respectively, and relate principally to the construction of the new distribution facilities, investments in warehouse expansions and improvements, information technology and warehouse automation. The Company estimates that it will spend approximately $175 million to $200 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2005. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company paid $39.0 million for the remaining 40% equity interest in International Physician Networks (IPN), a physician education and management consulting company, that it did not previously own. Additionally, the Company paid approximately $13.7 million in cash for MedSelect, Inc., a provider of automated medication and supply dispensing cabinets, and $16.6 million in cash for Imedex, Inc., an accredited provider of continuing medical education for physicians. During fiscal 2003, the Company acquired Anderson Packaging Inc. (Anderson), a leading provider of physician and retail contracted packaging services to pharmaceutical manufacturers. The purchase price was approximately $100.1 million, which included the repayment of Anderson debt of $13.8 million and $0.8 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition. The Company paid part of the purchase price by issuing 814,145 shares of its common stock with an aggregate market value of $55.6 million. The Company paid the remaining purchase price, which was approximately $44.5 million, in cash. 36 Table of Contents During fiscal 2003, the Company acquired an additional 40% equity interest in IPN and satisfied the residual contingent obligation for its initial 20% equity interest for an aggregate $24.7 million in cash. During fiscal 2003, the Company acquired US Bioservices Corporation (US Bio), a national pharmaceutical products and services provider focused on the management of high cost complex therapies and reimbursement support for a total base purchase price of $160.2 million, which included the repayment of US Bio debt of $14.8 million and $1.5 million of transaction costs associated with this acquisition. The Company paid part of the base purchase price by issuing 2,399,091 shares of its common stock with an aggregate market value of $131.0 million. The Company paid the remaining $29.2 million of the base purchase price in cash. In July 2003, a contingent payment of $2.5 million was paid in cash by the Company. During fiscal 2003, the Company acquired Bridge Medical, Inc., a leading provider of barcode enabled point of care software designed to reduce medication errors, to enhance the Companys offerings in the pharmaceutical supply channel, for a total base purchase price of $28.4 million, which included $0.7 million of transaction costs associated with this acquisition. The Company paid part of the base purchase price by issuing 401,780 shares of its common stock with an aggregate market value of $22.9 million and the remaining base purchase price was paid with $5.5 million of cash. During fiscal 2003, the Company also used cash of $3.0 million to purchase three smaller companies related to the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and paid $9.8 million to eliminate the right of the former stockholders of AutoMed Technologies, Inc. (AutoMed) to receive up to $55.0 million in contingent payments based on AutoMed achieving defined earnings targets through the end of calendar 2004. During fiscal 2002, the Company acquired AutoMed for $120.4 million. In June 2003, the Company amended the 2002 agreement under which it acquired AutoMed (as discussed above). The Company also acquired other smaller businesses for $15.8 million. Additionally, the Company purchased equity interests in various businesses for $4.1 million. As described above, the Company used $300 million to redeem the Subordinated Notes and $8.4 million to redeem the 6 7/8% Notes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. Additionally, the Company repaid $60 million of the Term Facility in fiscal 2004. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company issued the aforementioned $300 million of 7 1/4% Notes. The Company used the net proceeds of the 7 1/4% Notes to repay $15 million of the Term Facility, to repay $150 million in aggregate principal of the Bergen 7 3/8% senior notes and redeem the PharMerica 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes due 2008 at a redemption price equal to 104.19% of the $123.5 million principal amount. The Company also repaid an additional $45 million of the Term Facility, as scheduled. During the year ended September 30, 2002, the Company made net repayments of $37.0 million on its receivables securitization facilities. The Company also repaid debt of $23.1 million during the year, principally consisting of $20.6 million for the retirement of Bergens 7% debentures pursuant to a tender offer, which was required as a result of the merger with Bergen. The Company has paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.025 per share on its common stock since the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Recently, a dividend of $0.025 per share was declared by the Companys Board of Directors on November 11, 2004, and was paid on December 7, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 22, 2004. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Market Risk The Companys most significant market risk is the effect of changing interest rates. The Company manages this risk by using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. At September 30, 2004, the Company had approximately $1.2 billion of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.1% and $235.0 million of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the Companys working capital requirements. The Company periodically evaluates various financial instruments that could mitigate a portion of its exposure to variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. There were no such financial instruments in effect at September 30, 2004. For every $100 million of unhedged variable rate debt outstanding, a 31 basis point increase in interest rates (one tenth of the average variable rate at September 30, 2004) would increase the Companys annual interest expense by $0.31 million. 37 Table of Contents Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards In December 2003, FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. This revision to SFAS No. 132 does not change the measurement or recognition requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans, however, it does revise employers disclosures to require more information about their plan assets, obligations to pay benefits, funding obligations, cash flows and other relevant information. As required, the Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 132. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, which was subsequently revised in December 2003 (Interpretation No. 46). Interpretation No. 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, and requires consolidation of variable interest entities by their primary beneficiaries if certain conditions are met. Interpretation No. 46 applied immediately to variable interest entities created or obtained after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or obtained before January 31, 2003, the adoption of this standard was effective as of December 31, 2003 for a variable interest in special purpose entities and as of March 31, 2004 for all other variable interest entities. The Company implemented Interpretation No. 46, on a retroactive basis, during the three months ended December 31, 2003 for variable interests in special purpose entities and, as a result, the Company ceased consolidating Bergens Capital I Trust (the Trust) as the Company was not designated as the Trusts primary beneficiary. Prior to the adoption of this standard, and the May 2004 redemption of the Trusts preferred securities, the Company reported the Trusts preferred securities as long term debt in its consolidated financial statements. As a result of deconsolidating the Trust, the Company reported the notes issued to the Trust as long term debt at December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004. Because the notes had the same carrying value as the preferred securities and the interest on the notes was equal to the cash distributions on the preferred securities, the adoption of this standard had no impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements. During the quarter ended June 30, 2004, the Company redeemed the notes and, as a result, the Trust redeemed the preferred securities. The Company did not create or obtain any variable interest entity after February 1, 2003. The Company evaluated the remaining provisions of Interpretation No. 46, and the adoption of these provisions did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. 38 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements Certain of the statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and elsewhere in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
