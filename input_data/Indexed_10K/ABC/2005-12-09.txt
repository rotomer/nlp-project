ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained herein. The Company is a national pharmaceutical services company providing drug distribution and related healthcare services and solutions to its customers. The Company also provides pharmaceuticals to long term care and workers compensation patients. The Company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers, and substantially all of its operations are located in the United States. The Companys operations are comprised of two reportable segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica. Pharmaceutical Distribution The Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment includes the operations of AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC) and the AmerisourceBergen Specialty and Packaging groups. The operations of the former AmerisourceBergen Technology Group became a part of the overall ABDC operations in fiscal 2005. The Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments: ABDC and AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG). The ABDC operating segment includes the operations of the AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group. Servicing both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. The drug distribution operations of ABDC and ABSG comprised over 90% of the segments operating revenue and over 80% of the segments operating income in fiscal 2005. ABDC distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals, over the counter healthcare products, and home healthcare supplies and equipment to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order facilities, physicians, clinics and other alternate site facilities. ABDC is in a business model transition with respect to how manufacturers compensate us for our services. Historically, supplier arrangements allowed us to generate gross profit in several ways, including cash discounts for prompt payments, inventory buying opportunities, rebates, inventory management and other agreements, vendor program arrangements, negotiated deals and other promotional opportunities. A significant portion of ABDCs gross margin had been derived from our ability to purchase merchandise inventories in advance of pharmaceutical price increases and then hold these inventories until pharmaceutical prices increase, thereby generating a larger gross margin upon sale of the inventories. Over the last two years, pharmaceutical manufacturers have been increasing their control over the pharmaceutical supply channel by using product allocation methods, including the imposition of inventory management agreements (IMAs). Under a typical IMA arrangement, the Company is compensated based on specific contract defined formulas for maintaining a certain level of inventory for a pre defined period prior to, as of, or subsequent to the date of a manufacturer price increase. The payment is triggered upon the manufacturer price increase and is recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold over the longer of the product sell through period or post price increase monitoring period. Because the payment trigger is the date of the manufacturer price increase and the size of the payment is typically dependent on the percentage price increase, changes in manufacturers pricing patterns can cause significant volatility to the Companys periodic earnings. Additionally, pharmaceutical manufacturers imposed restrictions on our ability to purchase their products from alternate sources and have been requesting more product and distribution sales data from us. Effective October 1, 2005, the Company voluntarily made a decision to purchase all pharmaceuticals only from manufacturers in an effort to further protect the integrity of the supply channel. All of the above has led to significant volatility in ABDCs gross margin and, therefore, we are continuing our efforts to shift our pharmaceutical distribution business to a fee for service model where we are compensated for the services we provide manufacturers versus one that is dependent upon manufacturer price increases (as is the case with the IMA model). We continue to work with our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners to define fee for service terms that will adequately compensate us for our services, such as our distribution services, inventory management, service level management, and other services. Under a typical fee for service agreement, the Company is compensated for its services based on a percentage of purchases over a defined time period. Amounts due for services rendered in the current period would typically be earned in the following month as a reduction of cost of goods sold as the related product is sold. As of September 30, 2005, we have signed agreements with a number of the 21 Table of Contents large branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that we consider fee for service arrangements as well as some that we consider hybrid agreements with some attributes of IMAs and some attributes of fee for service arrangements. We believe the transition to a fee for service model will improve the efficiency of the supply channel and may establish a more predictable earnings pattern for ABDC, while expanding our service relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers. The fee for service arrangements may establish a more predictable earnings pattern because under many of the agreements the Company earns a fee for its services performed on a monthly basis in contrast to the IMA model where earnings are largely predicated upon the timing and amount of pharmaceutical price increases. We continue to have discussions with pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding fee for service arrangements and expect to have agreements in place with a substantial majority of the large branded manufacturers by the end of calendar 2005. During fiscal 2006, we expect that more than 75% of ABDCs brand name manufacturer gross margin will not be contingent on manufacturer price increases. The business model transition has had the effect of reducing merchandise inventories because IMA and fee for service agreements both limit the amount of inventory we can carry and, as a result, we have experienced a significant increase in cash flow from operations. The majority of the reduction in merchandise inventories has been realized as of September 30, 2005 as days held in inventory have decreased from 50 days during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 to 42 days during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to 32 days during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, we would expect merchandise inventories to stabilize as the large majority of branded manufacturers are expected to be under some form of fee for service contract and, as a result, we would expect future cash flow from operations to track more closely to net income. ABDC also provides scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment, medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. ABSG, through a number of individual operating businesses, provides distribution and other services, including group purchasing services, to physicians and alternate care providers who specialize in a variety of disease states, including oncology, nephrology, and rheumatology. ABSG also distributes vaccines, other injectables, plasma and other blood products. In addition, through its manufacturer services and physician and patient services businesses, ABSG provides a number of commercialization, third party logistics, and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers, reimbursement consulting, practice management, and physician education. ABSGs business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, including oncology drugs. The reimbursement changes that have been implemented by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Modernization Act), and that are scheduled to be implemented in the future, may have the effect of reducing the amount and or margins of medications purchased by physicians for administration in their offices and may force patients to other healthcare providers. Since ABSG provides a number of services to or through physicians, patient shifts from physicians to other healthcare providers may result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for ABSG. Although ABSG has contingency plans to enable it to retain and grow the business it conducts with and through physicians, there can be no assurance that it will retain or replace all of the revenue currently going through the physician channel or that such revenue will be as profitable. The AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group consists of American Health Packaging and Anderson Packaging (Anderson). American Health Packaging delivers unit dose, punch card, unit of use and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. Anderson is a leading provider of contracted packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers. 22 Table of Contents PharMerica The PharMerica segment includes the operations of the PharMerica long term care business (Long Term Care) and a workers compensation related business (Workers Compensation). The PharMerica reportable segment encompasses only the PharMerica operating segment. Long Term Care is a leading national provider of pharmacy products and services to patients in long term care and alternate site settings, including skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and residential living communities. Long Term Cares institutional pharmacy business involves the purchase of bulk quantities of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals, principally from our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, and the distribution of those products to residents in long term care and alternate site facilities. Unlike hospitals, most long term and alternate care facilities do not have onsite pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs, but depend instead on institutional pharmacies, such as Long Term Care, to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication. Long Term Care pharmacies dispense pharmaceuticals in patient specific packaging in accordance with physician orders. In addition, Long Term Care provides infusion therapy services and Medicare Part B products, as well as formulary management and other pharmacy consulting services. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the Medicare Modernization Act may have on the Long Term Care business. The ongoing implementation of Medicare Part D (including coverage and reimbursement changes associated with the voluntary drug benefit program for seniors) could have an adverse effect on the Long Term Care business. At this time, the future impact of the Medicare Modernization Act on the Long Term Care business cannot be determined. Workers Compensation provides mail order and on line pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers compensation programs, and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors. Workers Compensation services include home delivery of prescription drugs, medical supplies and equipment and an array of computer software solutions to reduce the payors administrative costs. 23 Table of Contents AmerisourceBergen Corporation Summary Segment Information (dollars in thousands) Operating RevenueFiscal year ended September 30, 2005vs.2004Change 2004vs.2003Change 2005 2004 2003 Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 49,319,371 $ 48,113,015 $ 44,657,911 3 % 8 % PharMerica 1,571,369 1,575,255 1,608,203 (2 ) Intersegment eliminations (878,142 ) (875,818 ) (802,714 ) (9 ) Total $ 50,012,598 $ 48,812,452 $ 45,463,400 2 % 7 % (dollars in thousands) Operating IncomeFiscal year ended September 30, 2005vs.2004Change 2004vs.2003Change 2005 2004 2003 Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 532,887 $ 748,625 $ 791,216 (29 )% (5 )% PharMerica 91,947 121,846 103,843 (25 ) 17 Facility consolidations, employee severance and other (22,723 ) (7,517 ) (8,930 ) (202 ) 16 Gain on litigation settlements 40,094 38,005 5 n/a Impairment charge (5,259 ) n/a n/a Total $ 636,946 $ 900,959 $ 886,129 (29 )% 2 % Percentages of operating revenue: Pharmaceutical Distribution Gross profit 3.03 % 3.43 % 3.81 % Operating expenses 1.95 % 1.87 % 2.03 % Operating income 1.08 % 1.56 % 1.77 % PharMerica Gross profit 28.40 % 30.45 % 32.69 % Operating expenses 22.54 % 22.72 % 26.23 % Operating income 5.85 % 7.74 % 6.46 % AmerisourceBergen Corporation Gross profit 3.96 % 4.44 % 4.90 % Operating expenses 2.69 % 2.59 % 2.95 % Operating income 1.27 % 1.85 % 1.95 % 24 Table of Contents Year ended September 30, 2005 compared with Year ended September 30, 2004 Consolidated Results Operating revenue, which excludes bulk deliveries, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 increased 2% to $50.0 billion from $48.8 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. Bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the Company at the express direction of the customer, and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers warehouse sites or shipments from the supplier to the Company for immediate shipment to the customers warehouse sites. Bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 increased 6% to $4.6 billion from $4.3 billion in the prior fiscal year due to an increase in demand from the Companys largest bulk customer. The Company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has general inventory risk, physical loss inventory risk, and customer credit risk. As a result, and in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, the Company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues. Due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries, fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins. However, revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the Companys cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the Company and payments by the Company to its suppliers. In connection with the transition to a fee for service model, we changed our method of recognizing cash discounts and other related manufacturer incentives, effective October 1, 2004. ABDC previously recognized cash discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold when earned, which was primarily upon payment of vendor invoices. ABDC now records cash discounts as a component of inventory cost and recognizes such discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold upon the sale of the inventory. We believe the change in accounting method provides a more objectively determinable method of recognizing cash discounts and a better matching of inventory cost to revenue, as inventory turnover rates are expected to continue to improve. We recorded a $10.2 million charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting (net of tax of $6.3 million) in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. This $10.2 million cumulative effect charge reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.09 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The accounting change is incorporated in our results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The change improved earnings from continuing operations in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 by approximately $11.5 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share from continuing operations. The accounting change had the effect of increasing gross profit and operating income by $18.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. Gross profit of $1,980.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased 9% from $2,166.4 million in the prior fiscal year. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized gains of $40.1 million and $38.0 million, respectively, from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. These gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and contributed 2% of gross profit for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 3.96%, as compared to the prior year percentage of 4.44%. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflects declines in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to a decline in profits related to pharmaceutical price increases and other buy side profits, changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization (DSAD&A) of $1,315.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflects an increase of 4.6% from $1,258.0 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, DSAD&A in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 2.63%, compared to 2.58% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in the DSAD&A and the DSAD&A percentage in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 from the prior fiscal year was due to an increase in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment DSAD&A, including bad debt expenses. Total bad debt expense increased to $33.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 from a benefit of $10.3 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to a $15.5 million increase in bad debt expense relating to one of the operating companies within the Specialty Group. Additionally, the prior years bad debt expense was favorably impacted by $26.6 million of customer recoveries. In 2001, the Company developed an integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company decided to outsource a significant 25 Table of Contents portion of its information technology activities as part of the integration plan. The Companys plan, as revised, is to have a distribution facility network numbering in the mid 20s within the next two years and to have successfully completed the outsourcing of such information technology activities by the end of fiscal 2006. The plan includes building six new facilities (four of which were operational as of September 30, 2005) and closing facilities (twenty three of which have been closed through September 30, 2005). The fifth facility opened in October 2005 and the sixth facility is scheduled to open during fiscal 2006, thereby reducing the total number of distribution facilities to 28 by the end of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2005 and 2004, the Company closed six and four distribution facilities, respectively. The Company anticipates closing six additional facilities in fiscal 2006. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company closed six distribution facilities and eliminated certain administrative and operational functions (the fiscal 2003 initiatives). During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $0.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of employee severance costs relating to the fiscal 2003 initiatives. Through September 30, 2004, approximately 780 employees received termination notices as a result of the fiscal 2003 initiatives, of which substantially all have been terminated. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, severance accruals of $1.8 million recorded in September 2001 were reversed into income because certain employees who were expected to be severed either voluntarily left the Company or were retained in other positions within the Company. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company closed four distribution facilities and eliminated duplicative administrative functions (the fiscal 2004 initiatives). During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company recorded $5.4 million of employee severance costs in connection with the fiscal 2004 initiatives. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company announced plans to continue to consolidate and eliminate certain administrative functions, and to outsource a significant portion of the Companys information technology activities (the fiscal 2005 initiatives). As of September 30, 2005, approximately 700 employees had received termination notices as a result of the 2004 and 2005 initiatives, of which approximately 630 have been terminated. Additional amounts for integration initiatives will be recognized in subsequent periods as facilities to be consolidated are identified and specific plans are approved and announced. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company recorded $13.3 million of employee severance and lease cancellation costs primarily related to the 2005 initiatives and $9.4 million of transition costs associated with the outsourcing of information technology activities. The Company paid a total of $13.5 million and $9.5 million for employee severance, lease cancellation and other costs in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to the aforementioned integration plan. Remaining unpaid amounts of $12.3 million for employee severance, lease cancellation and other costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2005. Most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time, generally not to exceed 12 months, while others may receive a lump sum payment. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.3 million relating to certain intangible assets within the technology operations of ABDC. Operating income of $636.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflects a decrease of 29% compared to $901.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The Companys operating income as a percentage of operating revenue was 1.27% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 compared to 1.85% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in operating income was primarily due to the decline in gross profit. The gain on litigation settlements, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other, and the impairment charge increased operating income by $12.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The gain on litigation settlement, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other, increased operating income by $30.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, a technology company in which the Company had an equity investment sold substantially all of its assets and paid a liquidating dividend. As a result, the Company recorded a gain of $8.4 million in other income during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. Interest expense, net, decreased 49% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 to $57.2 million from $112.7 million in the prior fiscal year due to a net decline in average borrowings. Average borrowings, net of cash, under the Companys debt facilities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 were $183.1 million as compared to average borrowings, net of cash, of $1.1 billion in the prior fiscal year. The reductions in average borrowings, net of cash, were achieved due to the Companys 26 Table of Contents strong cash flows generated from operations, including reduced merchandise inventories resulting from the aforementioned business model transition. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $111.9 million and $23.6 million, respectively, in losses resulting from the early retirement of debt. Income tax expense of $176.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflects an effective income tax rate of 37.7%, versus 38.4% in the prior fiscal year. The reduction in tax rates resulted from the resolution of certain federal and state income tax issues during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The Company expects to have an effective income tax rate in the range of approximately 38% in future periods. Income from continuing operations of $291.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflects a decrease of 39% from $474.9 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decline in operating income and the loss from the early retirement of debt partially offset by the decrease in interest expense. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.73 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflects a 34% decrease from $4.12 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. The gain on litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other, the impairment charge and the loss on early retirement of debt decreased income from continuing operations by $64.2 million and decreased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.60 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The gain on litigation settlement less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other and the loss on early retirement of debt increased income from continuing operations by $4.2 million and increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.04 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, relates to the December 2004 sale of the Companys Rita Ann cosmetics distribution business as well as the sale of substantially all of the assets of Bridge Medical, Inc. (Bridge) in July 2005. The Company incurred a $6.5 million loss, net of tax, on the sale of the Rita Ann business, and a $4.6 million loss, net of tax, on the sale of the Bridge business, both of which are reflected in the loss from discontinued operations in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. Net income of $264.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflects a decrease of 43% from $468.4 million in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share of $2.48 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflects a decrease of 39% as compared to $4.06 per share in the prior fiscal year. The decline in diluted earnings per share was less than the decline in net income due to the reduced number of weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the Companys purchase of its common stock in connection with its stock buyback programs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) offset in part by the increase in the number of stock option exercises. Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment Results Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue of $49.3 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 increased 3% from $48.1 billion in the prior fiscal year. In fiscal 2004, the Company discontinued servicing the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and AdvancePCS. These former customers contributed 4.8% and 4.4%, respectively, of the segments operating revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. The lost business was offset by the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical distribution business and the market growth of ABDC. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, 57% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 43% was from sales to retail customers; this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 59% institutional and 41% retail. In comparison with the prior year results, sales to institutional customers were flat primarily due to the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical distribution business, offset by the loss of the VA and AdvancePCS business. Sales to retail customers increased 7% over the prior year primarily due to market growth and an increase in sales to one of the Companys larger retail customers. This segments growth largely reflects U.S. pharmaceutical industry conditions, including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset, in part, by the increased use of lower priced generics. The segments growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix. Industry sales in the United States, as estimated by industry data firm IMS Healthcare, Inc., are expected to grow between 8% and 9% in 2006 and annually between 7% and 10% through 2009. Future operating revenue growth will continue to be affected by competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, changes in Federal government rules and regulations and industry growth trends, such as the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers. The Companys Specialty Group has been growing at rates in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth. The majority of this Groups revenue is generated 27 Table of Contents from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, such as oncology, nephrology, and rheumatology. Additionally, the Specialty Group distributes vaccines and blood plasma. The Specialty Groups oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the Specialty Groups most significant contributor to revenue growth. The Specialty Groups business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, including oncology drugs. The reimbursement changes that have been implemented by HHS pursuant to the Medicare Modernization Act, or that may be proposed or implemented in the future, may have the effect of reducing the amount and or margins of medications purchased by physicians for administration in their offices and may force patients to other healthcare providers. Since the Specialty Group provides a number of services to or through physicians, patient shifts from physicians to other healthcare providers may result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for the Specialty Group. Although the Specialty Group has contingency plans to enable it to retain and grow the business it conducts with and through physicians, there can be no assurance that it will retain or replace all of the revenue currently going through the physician channel or that such revenue will be as profitable. Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit of $1,493.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflects a decrease of 9% from $1,648.7 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 3.03%, as compared to 3.43% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in the buy side component of the gross margin, including a decline in inventory appreciation profits, fewer alternate source and deal opportunities and the loss of the VA business in fiscal 2004. Contributing to the decline in inventory appreciation profits were lower levels of inventory on hand during the current fiscal year as a result of the business model transition, and fewer than expected manufacturer price increases prior to the national election in November 2004. The Companys cost of goods sold includes a last in, first out (LIFO) provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, inventory balances declined, which resulted in liquidation of LIFO layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effects of the liquidations in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were to decrease cost of goods sold by $30.6 million and $10.3 million, respectively. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating expenses of $961.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflect an increase of 7% from $900.1 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 were 1.95%, as compared to 1.87% in the prior fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of $49.2 million (which included a $15.5 million increase in bad debt relating to one of the operating companies within the Specialty Group) and fiscal 2005 start up costs incurred in connection with the new distribution facilities which were primarily offset by continued productivity gains achieved throughout the Companys distribution network. Additionally, prior years bad debt expense was favorably impacted by a $17.5 million recovery from a large former customer. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income of $532.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflects a decrease of 29% from $748.6 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 1.08%, as compared to 1.56% in the prior fiscal year. The decline from the prior year percentage was primarily due to a reduction in gross profit. While management historically has been able to lower expense ratios, this did not occur in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 and there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future, or that expense ratio reductions, if they should occur, will offset possible declines in gross margins. PharMerica Segment Results PharMerica operating revenue of $1,571.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was flat compared to $1,575.3 million in the prior fiscal year. PharMericas operating revenue was impacted by competitive pressures that affected both the Long Term Care and Workers Compensation businesses and increasing reductions in Medicaid reimbursement rates. The future operating revenue growth rate will likely continue to be impacted by competitive pressures, changes in the regulatory environment (including the reimbursement changes that have been implemented pursuant to the Medicare Modernization Act as well as the implementation of the voluntary prescription drug benefit program for seniors thereunder) and the pharmaceutical inflation rate. PharMerica gross profit of $446.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflects a decrease of 7% from $479.7 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 28.40%, as compared to 30.45% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to industry competitive pressures, and a reduction in the rates of reimbursement for the services provided by PharMerica, which continue to adversely affect gross profit margins in both the Workers Compensation and Long Term Care businesses. PharMerica operating expenses of $354.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased 1% from $357.9 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses decreased slightly to 22.54% in 28 Table of Contents the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 from 22.72% in the prior fiscal year. PharMericas fiscal 2005 operating expenses were favorably impacted by aggressive cost reductions in response to the decline in operating revenue, including the consolidation of local pharmacy administrative functions to regional centers for the Long Term Care business, a reduction in bad debt expense of $5.5 million due to continued improvements made in credit and collection practices, and continued improvements in operating practices of both the Workers Compensation and Long Term Care businesses. The prior years operating expenses were favorably impacted by a $12.1 million reduction in sales and use tax liability due to favorable audit experience and other settlements. PharMerica operating income of $91.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased 25% from $121.8 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 5.85%, as compared to 7.74% in the prior fiscal year. The decline was due to the aforementioned reduction in the gross profit margin. While management historically has been able to lower expense ratios there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future, or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible further declines in gross margins. Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to PharMerica. ABDC is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to PharMerica. Year ended September 30, 2004 compared with Year ended September 30, 2003 Consolidated Results Operating revenue, which excludes bulk deliveries, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 increased 7% to $48.8 billion from $45.5 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, offset slightly by a decline in operating revenue in the PharMerica segment. The Companys customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company changed its accounting policy for customer sales returns to reflect an accrual for estimated customer returns at the time of sale to the customer. Previously, the Company accounted for customer sales returns as a reduction of sales and cost of goods sold at the time of the return. As a result of this accounting policy change, operating revenue and cost of goods sold were each reduced by $316.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. Bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the Company at the express direction of the customer, and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers warehouse sites or shipments from the supplier to the Company for immediate shipment to the customers warehouse sites. Bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 increased 5% to $4.3 billion from $4.1 billion in the prior fiscal year due to an increase in demand from the Companys largest bulk customer. The Company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has general inventory risk, physical loss inventory risk, and customer credit risk. As a result, and in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, the Company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues. Due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries, fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins. However, revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the Companys cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the Company and payments by the Company to its suppliers. Gross profit of $2,166.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 decreased 3% from $2,225.6 million in the prior fiscal year. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company recognized a $38.0 million gain from an antitrust litigation settlement with a pharmaceutical manufacturer. This gain was recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and contributed 2% of gross profit for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 4.44%, as compared to the prior year percentage of 4.90%. The decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflects declines in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to a decline in profits related to pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases, changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures, offset in part by the antitrust litigation settlement. DSAD&A of $1,258.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a decrease of 5% compared to $1,330.6 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, DSAD&A in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 2.58% compared to 2.93% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in the DSAD&A percentage from the prior fiscal year 29 Table of Contents reflects improvements in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to: (a) a $56.3 million reduction of bad debt expense primarily due to a $17.5 million recovery from a former customer in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, a $9.1 million recovery from a customer in the PharMerica segment, and the continued improvements made in the credit and collection practices in both segments (see further discussion below); (b) a $12.1 million reduction in PharMericas sales and use tax liability; (c) a reduction in employee headcount resulting from our integration efforts; and (d) operational efficiencies primarily derived from our integration plan. Within Pharmaceutical Distribution, credit and collection practices improved following the consolidation and relocation of the national account credit and collection process from Orange, California to the Companys executive headquarters in Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania in early 2004. This consolidation led to increased management control and facilitated the favorable resolution of certain long standing disputes with major national account customers. Additionally, the Company placed significant emphasis on reducing past due and disputed receivables that had accumulated at one of our distribution centers as a result of a systems conversion in fiscal 2003. PharMericas credit and collection practices were improved by consolidating all of its billing and collections onto one pharmacy system, establishing consistent billing and collection policies and procedures, and centralizing its collection efforts for national accounts. Additionally, improvements in the financial strength of the nursing home industry had a favorable impact on PharMericas bad debt expense. In 2001, the Company developed an integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions. As of September 30, 2004, this plan resulted in synergies of approximately $150 million on an annual basis. The Companys plan, as revised, is to have a distribution facility network numbering in the mid 20s within the next two years. The plan includes building six new facilities and closing facilities. During fiscal 2004 and 2003, the Company closed four and six distribution facilities, respectively. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company closed six distribution facilities and eliminated certain administrative and operational functions (the fiscal 2003 initiatives). During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $0.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of employee severance costs relating to the fiscal 2003 initiatives. Through September 30, 2004, approximately 780 employees received termination notices as a result of the fiscal 2003 initiatives, of which substantially all have been terminated. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, severance accruals of $1.8 million recorded in September 2001 were reversed into income because certain employees who were expected to be severed either voluntarily left the Company or were retained in other positions within the Company. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company closed four distribution facilities and eliminated duplicative administrative functions (the fiscal 2004 initiatives). During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company recorded $5.4 million of employee severance costs in connection with the termination of 230 employees relating to the fiscal 2004 initiatives. As of September 30, 2004, approximately 190 employees had been terminated and the remainder were terminated in fiscal 2005. The Company paid a total of $9.5 million and $13.8 million for employee severance and lease and contract cancellation costs in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the aforementioned integration plan. Remaining unpaid amounts of $3.1 million for employee severance and lease cancellation costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2004. Most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time, generally not to exceed 12 months, while others may receive a lump sum payment. Operating income of $901.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 increased slightly compared to $886.1 million in the prior fiscal year. The gain on litigation settlement less costs of facility consolidations and employee severance increased the Companys operating income by $30.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 and costs of facility consolidations and employee severance reduced the Companys operating income by $8.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The Companys operating income as a percentage of operating revenue was 1.85% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 compared to 1.95% in the prior fiscal year. The gain on litigation settlement contributed approximately 8 basis points to the Companys operating income as a percentage of operating revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. The contribution provided by the litigation settlement was offset by a decrease in gross margin in excess of the aforementioned DSAD&A expense percentage reduction. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, a technology company in which the Company had an equity investment sold substantially all of its assets and paid a liquidating dividend. As a result, the Company recorded a gain of $8.4 million in other income during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company recorded losses of $8.0 million, which primarily consisted of a $5.5 million charge related to the decline in fair value of its equity investment in the technology company because the decline was judged to be other than temporary. 30 Table of Contents Interest expense, net, decreased 22% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 to $112.7 million from $144.7 million in the prior fiscal year. Average borrowings, net of cash, under the Companys debt facilities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 were $1.1 billion as compared to average borrowings, net of cash, of $2.3 billion in the prior fiscal year. The reduction in average borrowings, net of cash, was achieved due to lower inventory levels in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 due to the impact of inventory management agreements, reductions in buy side purchasing opportunities and the reduced number of distribution facilities as a result of the Companys integration activities. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $23.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in losses resulting from the early retirement of debt. Income tax expense of $296.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects an effective income tax rate of 38.4%, versus 39.2% in the prior fiscal year. The Company was able to lower its effective income tax rate during fiscal 2004 by implementing tax planning strategies. Income from continuing operations of $474.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects an increase of 7% from $443.1 million in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.12 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects an increase of 5% from $3.91 per share in the prior fiscal year. The gain on litigation settlement less costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other, and the loss on early retirement of debt increased income from continuing operations by $4.2 million and increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.04 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. Costs of facility consolidations and employee severance and the loss on early retirement of debt had the effect of decreasing income from continuing operations by $8.0 million and reducing diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.07 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. During fiscal 2005, the Company decided to discontinue the operations of its patient safety software and cosmetics distribution businesses as a result of their divestiture. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $6.5 million and $1.8 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net income of $468.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects an increase of 6% from $441.2 million in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share of $4.06 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a 4% increase as compared to $3.89 per share in the prior fiscal year. The growth in earnings per share was less than the growth in net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 due to the effect of the issuance of Company common stock in connection with acquisitions and in connection with the exercise of stock options. Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue of $48.1 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects an increase of 8% from $44.7 billion in the prior fiscal year. The Companys change in accounting for customer sales returns had the effect of reducing operating revenue growth by 1% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, 59% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 41% was from sales to retail customers; this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 57% institutional and 43% retail. In comparison with prior year results, sales to institutional customers increased 12% in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the above market rate growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business and higher revenues from customers engaged in the mail order sale of pharmaceuticals, which was offset in part by the discontinuance of servicing the VA during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 as a result of losing a competitive bid process. The VA contract was terminated in May 2004 and contributed 4.8% and 7.8% of the segments operating revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In March 2004, Caremark Rx, Inc. acquired Advance PCS, one of the Companys largest customers. As a result, the Companys contract with Advance PCS was terminated in August 2004. Advance PCS accounted for approximately 4.4% and 4.8% of the segments operating revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sales to retail customers increased 2% over the prior fiscal year. The independent retail sector experienced strong double digit sales growth while sales in the chain retail sector decreased by 6% due to sales declines experienced by certain large regional retail chain customers. Additionally, retail sales in the first half of fiscal 2004 were adversely impacted by the prior fiscal year loss of a large customer. This segments growth largely reflects U.S. pharmaceutical industry conditions, including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset, in part, by the increased use of lower priced generics. The segments growth 31 Table of Contents has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix. The Companys Specialty Group has been growing at rates in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth. The majority of this Groups revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, such as oncology, nephrology, and rheumatology. Additionally, the Specialty Group distributes vaccines and blood plasma. The Specialty Groups oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the Specialty Groups most significant contributor to revenue growth. Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit of $1,648.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a decrease of 3% from $1,700.0 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 3.43%, as compared to 3.81% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue was the result of: a reduction in profits related to pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases; the VA contract loss; the continuing competitive environment, which has led to a number of contract renewals with reduced profitability; and the negative impact of a change in customer mix to a higher percentage of large institutional, mail order and chain accounts. The Companys cost of goods sold includes a last in, first out (LIFO) provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating expenses of $900.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflect a decrease of 1% from $908.7 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 were 1.87%, as compared to 2.03% in the prior fiscal year, an improvement of 16 basis points. The decrease in the operating expense percentage reflects the changing customer mix described above, efficiencies of scale, the elimination of redundant costs through the integration processes, continued emphasis on productivity throughout the Companys distribution network, and a significant reduction in bad debt expense of $33.9 million (including a $17.5 million reduction of a previously recorded allowance for doubtful account as a result of a settlement with a former customer), as previously discussed. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income of $748.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a decrease of 5% from $791.2 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 1.56%, as compared to 1.77% in the prior fiscal year. The decline over the prior year percentage was due to a reduction in gross margin in excess of the decline in the operating expense ratio. PharMerica Segment PharMerica operating revenue of $1,575.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a decrease of 2% from $1,608.2 million in the prior fiscal year. PharMericas decline in operating revenue was primarily due to the loss of two significant customers in the Workers Compensation business, the discontinuance of the sale of healthcare products within the Long Term Care business and the loss of a Long Term Care business customer because it was acquired by a customer of a competitor. PharMerica gross profit of $479.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflects a decrease of 9% from $525.6 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 30.45%, as compared to 32.69% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in gross profit is primarily due to industry competitive pressures, and a reduction in the rates of reimbursement for the services provided by PharMerica, which continue to adversely affect gross profit margins in both the Workers Compensation business and the Long Term Care business. PharMerica operating expenses of $357.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 reflect a decrease of 15% from $421.8 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses were reduced to 22.72% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 from 26.23% in the prior fiscal year. The percentage reduction was primarily due to aggressive cost reductions in response to the decline in operating revenue, a significant reduction in bad debt expense of $22.4 million (including a $9.1 million recovery from a customer) due to continued improvements made in credit and collection practices, a $12.1 million reduction in sales and use tax liability due to favorable audit experience and other settlements, and continued improvements in operating practices of both the Workers Compensation and the Long Term Care businesses. PharMerica operating income of $121.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 increased by 17% from $103.8 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 was 7.74%, as compared to 6.46% in the prior fiscal year. The improvement was due to the aforementioned reduction in the operating expense ratio, which was greater than the reduction in gross profit margin. 32 Table of Contents Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to PharMerica. ABDC is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to PharMerica. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting estimates are those accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing the Companys financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the Company for its pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, its customers financial strength and credit standing, and payment and default history. Changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in the Companys allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by Company management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables. Each of the Companys business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise. The Company writes off balances against the reserves when collectibility is deemed remote. Each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and the Companys largest business units perform such reviews monthly. There were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. The bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts, net of write offs and recoveries. Schedule II of this Form 10 K sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $33.4 million, ($10.3) million and $46.0 million, respectively. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, bad debt expense was significantly impacted due to a $15.5 million increase in bad debt relating to one of the operating companies within the Specialty Group. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, debt expense was favorably impacted by a $17.5 million recovery from a former customer in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, a $9.1 million recovery from a customer in the PharMerica segment, and the continued improvements made in the credit and collection practices in both segments. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2005 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately $3.1 million. Supplier Reserves The Company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due them from the Company. These reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of Company management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to the Company. The Company evaluates the amounts due from its suppliers on a continual basis and adjusts the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2005 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately $5.3 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different than the Companys estimate. Loss Contingencies The Company accrues for loss contingencies related to litigation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The Company regularly 33 Table of Contents reviews loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates. Merchandise Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 87% and 92% of the Companys inventories at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method. If the Company had used the first in, first out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $159.8 million and $166.1 million higher than the amounts reported at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, inventory balances declined, which resulted in liquidation of LIFO layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2005 was to decrease cost of goods sold by $30.6 million and increase diluted earnings per share by $0.17. The effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2004 was to decrease cost of goods sold by $10.3 million and increase diluted earnings per share by $0.05. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships, non compete agreements, patents and software technology, will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives under SFAS No. 142, a determination of the fair value of the Companys reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based, among other things, on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit and or the component of the entity being valued. The Company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis. The Company uses an income approach to determine the fair value of its reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these fair values. The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2004 and determined that there was no impairment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company performed an impairment test on certain intangible assets within the technology operations of ABDC due to the existence of impairment indicators. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.3 million relating to certain of those intangible assets. The charge has been reflected in the Companys results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. Stock Options The Company may elect to account for stock options using either Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB 25) or SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The Company has elected to use the accounting method under APB 25 and the related interpretations to account for its stock options. Under APB 25, generally, when the exercise price of the Companys stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. Had the Company elected to use SFAS No. 123 to account for its stock options under the fair value method, it would have been required to record compensation expense and as a result, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 would have been lower by $0.04, $0.74 and $0.16, respectively. Effective September 1, 2004, the Company vested all employee options then outstanding with an exercise price in excess of $54.10 (the closing stock price on August 31, 2004). The accelerated vesting was approved by the Compensation and Succession Planning Committee of the Companys board of directors for employee retention purposes and in anticipation of the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. As a result of the accelerated vesting, the pro forma compensation expense and the corresponding reduction in diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2004 was significantly greater than the pro forma compensation expense and the corresponding reduction in diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2005 and 2003. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which requires companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments (including employee stock options) at fair value for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. In April 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a new rule allowing public companies to delay the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 123R, using the modified prospective transition method beginning on October 1, 2005, and therefore, will begin to expense the fair value of all outstanding options over their remaining service periods to the extent the options are not fully vested as of the adoption date and will expense the fair value of all future options granted subsequent to September 30, 2005 34 Table of Contents over their service periods. The Company estimates it will record pre tax share based compensation expense of approximately $14 million in fiscal 2006. This estimate may be impacted by potential changes to the structure of the Companys share based compensation plans which could impact the number of stock options granted in fiscal 2006, changes in valuation assumptions, the market price of the Companys common stock, among other things and, as a result, the actual pre tax share based compensation expense in fiscal 2006 may differ from the Companys current estimate. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table illustrates the Companys debt structure at September 30, 2005, including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility (in thousands): OutstandingBalance AdditionalAvailability Fixed Rate Debt: $400,000, 5 5/8% senior notes due 2012 $ 398,010 $ $500,000, 5 7/8% senior notes due 2015 497,508 Other 2,193 Total fixed rate debt 897,711 Variable Rate Debt: Blanco revolving credit facility due 2006 55,000 Revolving credit facility due 2009 687,985 Receivables securitization facility due 2007 1,050,000 Total variable rate debt 55,000 1,737,985 Total debt, including current portion $ 952,711 $ 1,737,985 The Companys $1.7 billion of aggregate availability under its revolving credit facility and its receivables securitization facility provide sufficient sources of capital to fund the Companys working capital requirements. The Companys aggregate availability was reduced to $1.4 billion as of October 31, 2005, because it elected to terminate the 364 day tranche under its receivables securitization facility (defined below). In an effort to reduce its interest expense, extend maturities of its long term debt and ease its debt covenant restrictions, the Company refinanced its long term debt in September 2005. The Company issued $400 million of 5.625% senior notes due September 15, 2012 (the 2012 Notes) and $500 million of 5.875% senior notes due September 15, 2015 (the 2015 Notes). The 2012 Notes and 2015 Notes each were sold at 99.5% of principal amount and have an effective yield of 5.71% and 5.94%, respectively. Interest on the 2012 Notes and the 2015 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears, commencing on March 15, 2006. Both the 2012 Notes and the 2015 Notes are redeemable at the Companys option at a price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount thereof, or the sum of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined. In addition, at any time before September 15, 2008, the Company may redeem up to an aggregate of 35% of the principal amount of the 2012 Notes or the 2015 Notes at redemption prices equal to 105.625% and 105.875%, respectively, of the principal amounts thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of redemption, with the cash proceeds of one or more equity issuances. In connection with the issuance of the 2012 Notes and the 2015 Notes, the Company incurred approximately $6.3 million and $7.9 million of costs, respectively, which were deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the notes. The gross proceeds from the sale of the 2012 Notes and the 2015 Notes were used to finance the early retirement of the $500 million of 8 1/8% senior notes due 2008 (the 8 1/8% Notes) and $300 million of 7 1/4% senior notes due 2012 (the 7 1/4% Notes) in September 2005, including the payment of $102.3 million of premiums and other costs. Additionally, the Company expensed $8.5 million of deferred financing costs related to the retirement of the 7 1/4% Notes and the 8 1/8% Notes. In November 2005, Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) announced that it raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings on the Company to BBB from BB+. As a result of the upgrade, the Company is entitled to substantially relaxed covenants under the indenture governing its 5.625% senior notes due 2012 and 5.875% senior notes due 2015, and to a lesser extent under its $700 million senior credit facility. In July 2003, the Company entered into a $1.05 billion receivables securitization facility (Receivables Securitization Facility). In connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, ABDC sells on a revolving basis certain accounts 35 Table of Contents receivable to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, a wholly owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. ABDC is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. After the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. In December 2004, the Company amended its Receivables Securitization Facility and under the terms of the amendment, the $550 million (three year tranche) originally scheduled to expire in July 2006 was increased to $700 million and the expiration date was extended to November 2007. Additionally, the $500 million (364 day tranche) scheduled to expire in July 2005 was reduced to $350 million and was set to expire in December 2005. In September 2005, the Company elected to terminate the 364 day tranche, effective October 31, 2005. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper plus a program fee, and will vary based on the Companys debt ratings. In April 2005, the Companys debt rating was raised by one of the rating agencies and in accordance with the terms of the Receivables Securitization Facility, the program fees were lowered. The program fee was 60 basis points for the three year tranche and 35 basis points for the 364 day tranche as of September 30, 2005. Additionally, the commitment fee on any unused credit was reduced to 20 basis points for the three year tranche and to 17.5 basis points for the 364 day tranche. At September 30, 2005, there were no borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility. In connection with entering into the Receivables Securitization Facility and the amendments thereto, the Company incurred approximately $2.8 million of costs, which were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the facility. The facility is a financing vehicle utilized by the Company because it offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. The Company securitizes its trade accounts, which are generally non interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In December 2004, the Company entered into a $700 million five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Senior Revolving Credit Facility) with a syndicate of lenders. The Senior Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Senior Credit Agreement (defined below). There were no borrowings outstanding under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2005. Interest on borrowings under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specific rates based on the Companys debt rating. In April 2005, the Companys debt rating was raised by one of the rating agencies and in accordance with the terms of the Senior Revolving Credit Facility, interest on borrowings accrue at either 80 basis points over LIBOR or the prime rate at September 30, 2005. Availability under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit ($12.0 million at September 30, 2005). The Company pays quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility at specific rates based on the Companys debt rating. In April 2005, the rate payable to maintain the availability of the $700 million commitment was reduced to 20 basis points per annum resulting from the Companys improved debt rating. In connection with entering into the Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Company incurred approximately $2.5 million of costs, which were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the facility. The Company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Senior Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that impose limitations on, among other things, additional indebtedness, distributions and dividends to stockholders, and investments. These covenants are less restrictive than those under the Senior Credit Agreement, thereby providing the Company with greater financial flexibility. Additional covenants require compliance with financial tests, including leverage and minimum earnings to fixed charges ratios. The Senior Credit Agreement consisted of a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $300 million term loan facility (the Term Facility), both of which had been scheduled to mature in August 2006. The Term Facility had scheduled quarterly maturities, which began in December 2002, totaling $60 million in each of fiscal 2003 and 2004, and $80 million and $100 million in fiscal 2005 and 2006, respectively. The scheduled term loan payments were made in fiscal 2004 and 2003. In December 2004, in connection with entering into the new Senior Revolving Credit Facility, as defined above, the Company repaid the remaining $180 million outstanding under the Term Facility and there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility. In connection with the early repayment of the Term Facility, the Company incurred a loss of $1.0 million relating to the write off of deferred financing costs. On October 3, 2005, the Company entered into a C$135 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Canadian Credit Facility) due December 2009 with a syndicate of lenders in connection with the Companys acquisition of Trent Drugs (Wholesale) Ltd and borrowed approximately C$92 million to complete the transaction. Interest on borrowings under the Canadian Credit Facility accrues at specific rates based on the Companys debt rating (0.675% over LIBOR or Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee Spread at October 3, 2005). The Company will pay quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the Canadian Credit Facility at specific rates based on the Companys debt rating (0.20% at October 3, 2005). The Company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Canadian Credit Facility at any time. The Canadian Credit Facility contains restrictions on, among other things, additional indebtedness, distributions and dividends to stockholders, investments and capital expenditures. Additional covenants require compliance with financial tests, including leverage and minimum earnings to fixed charges ratios. 36 Table of Contents During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company paid $100 million to redeem the Bergen 7 1/4% Senior Notes due June 1, 2005, upon their maturity. In December 2000, the Company issued $300.0 million of 5% convertible subordinated notes due December 1, 2007. The notes had an annual interest rate of 5%, payable semiannually, and were convertible into common stock of the Company at $52.97 per share at any time before their maturity or their prior redemption or repurchase by the Company. In December 2004, the Company announced that it would redeem its 5% convertible subordinated notes at a redemption price of 102.143% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest through the redemption date of January 3, 2005. The noteholders were given the option to accept cash or convert the notes to common stock of the Company. The notes were convertible into 5,663,730 shares of common stock, which translated to a conversion ratio of 18.8791 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of notes. Through January 3, 2005, the redemption date, the Company issued 5,663,144 shares of common stock from treasury to noteholders to redeem substantially all of the notes and paid $31,000 to redeem the remaining notes. During fiscal 2005, the Company subsequently repurchased 5.7 million shares of common stock, substantially equivalent to the number of common stock shares issued in connection with the conversion of the 5% notes. The Companys operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under its debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt and repurchases of shares of the Companys common stock. Cash flow from operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was $1.53 billion primarily due to the significant decline in merchandise inventories and an increase in accounts payable during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The significant decline in merchandise inventories during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflected the impact of the business model transition, including increasing compliance under current inventory management and fee for service agreements. We do not anticipate the Company will experience similar amounts of working capital reduction in future years as the Company has signed fee for service agreements with a substantial majority of manufacturers as of September 30, 2005. The Company expects cash flow from operations in fiscal 2006 to be between $500 million and $600 million. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the payment of interest on debt, finance merger integration initiatives and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. Significant cash flows from operations primarily resulting from the business model transition, as discussed above, has resulted in a near record low debt to capital ratio of 18.2% and a net debt to total capital ratio of less than zero. The Company has been and continues to actively evaluate its alternatives to deploy its excess capital. For example, the Company plans to repurchase $750 million of its common stock and recently announced that it will double its quarterly cash dividend. Additionally, on October 5, 2005, the Company acquired Trent Drugs (Wholesale) Ltd (Trent), one of the largest national pharmaceutical distributors in Canada, for a purchase price of $81.7 million, which included the assumption of debt of $41.3 million. The acquisition of Trent provides the Company a solid foundation to expand its pharmaceutical distribution capability into the Canadian marketplace. The Company expects to pursue further strategic acquisitions. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund the Companys ongoing cash requirements. Following is a summary of the Companys contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on its debt, minimum rental payments on its noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on its other commitments at September 30, 2005 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Within 1year 1 3years 4 5years After 5years Debt, including interest payments $ 1,410,053 $ 109,621 $ 104,807 $ 103,750 $ 1,091,875 Operating Leases 239,803 64,259 86,839 49,012 39,693 Other Commitments 1,272,067 47,268 218,284 262,558 743,957 Total $ 2,921,923 $ 221,148 $ 409,930 $ 415,320 $ 1,875,525 The $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility, which expires in April 2006, is included in the Within 1 year column in the above repayment table. However, this borrowing is not classified in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2005 because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. 37 Table of Contents In December 2004, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with a Canadian influenza vaccine manufacturer to distribute product through March 31, 2015. The agreement includes a commitment to purchase at least 12 million doses per year of the influenza vaccine provided the vaccine is approved and available for distribution in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Company will be required to purchase the annual doses at market prices, as adjusted for inflation and other factors. We expect the Canadian manufacturer will receive FDA approval by the 2006/2007 influenza season; however, FDA approval may be received earlier. If the initial year of the purchase commitment begins in fiscal 2007, then the Company anticipates its purchase commitment for that year will approximate $66 million. The Company anticipates its total purchase commitment (assuming the commitment commences in fiscal 2007) will be approximately $1.1 billion. The influenza vaccine commitment is included in Other Commitments in the above table. As of September 30, 2005, the Company has $7.1 million of remaining commitments relating to the construction of one of its new distribution facilities. This facility commitment is included in Other Commitments in the above table. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company decided to outsource a significant portion of its corporate and ABDC information technology activities and entered into a ten year commitment, effective July 1, 2005, with IBM Global Services, which will assume responsibility for performing the outsourced information technology activities following the completion of certain transition matters. The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $20 million to $25 million of transition costs in connection with this plan. These transition costs will include employee severance and other contract expenses. The Company incurred approximately one half of these costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The minimum commitment under the outsourcing arrangement is approximately $200 million (excluding the above mentioned transition costs) over a ten year period; however, the Company believes it will likely spend between $300 million and $400 million under the outsourcing arrangement to maintain and improve its information technology infrastructure during that period. The Company has included the minimum contractual commitment of $200 million in Other Commitments in the above table. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Companys operating activities provided $1.53 billion of cash as compared to cash provided of $825.1 million in the prior year period. Cash provided by operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was principally the result of a $1.1 billion decrease in merchandise inventories, a $311.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes, non cash items of $282.3 million, and net income of $264.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $392.8 million. The inventory turnover rate for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment improved to 10.2 times in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 from 8.2 times in the prior fiscal year. The improvement was derived from lower average inventory levels due to an increase in the number of fee for service agreements, inventory management and other vendor agreements, a reduction in buy side profit opportunities, and a reduction in the number of distribution facilities. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes is primarily due to an increase in sales volume, the timing of purchases of merchandise inventories and cash payments to our vendors. The increase in accounts receivable was largely driven by the continued strong revenue growth of ABSG, which has a significantly higher average days sales outstanding than ABDC and the timing of cash receipts from our customers. Average days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment were 40.2 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 compared to 38.4 days in the prior year period. Non cash items of $282.3 million included a $111.9 million loss on early retirement of debt and $90.9 million of depreciation and amortization. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 included $94.2 million in interest payments and $132.6 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Companys operating activities provided $825.1 million of cash. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2004 was principally the result of a decrease in merchandise inventories of $916.3 million, net income of $468.4 million and non cash items of $151.5 million, offset in part, by a $432.0 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes. The Companys change in accounting for customer sales returns had the effect of increasing merchandise inventories and reducing accounts receivable by $316.8 million at September 30, 2004. Merchandise inventories have continued to decline due to an increase in the number of inventory management agreements, a reduction in buy side profit opportunities, and a reduction in the number of distribution facilities. The turnover of merchandise inventories for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment has improved to 8.2 times in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 from 6.7 times in the prior fiscal year. The $446.7 million decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the decline of merchandise inventories. Average days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment increased slightly to 17.1 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 from 16.9 days in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the strong revenue growth of ABSG, which has a significantly higher average days sales outstanding than ABDC. Average days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment improved to 38.4 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 from 39.3 days in the prior fiscal year as a result of the continued emphasis on receivables management. Non cash items of $151.5 million included $87.1 million of depreciation and amortization and $48.9 million of deferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes of $48.9 million in fiscal 2004 were significantly lower than the $127.2 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to the decline in income tax deductions associated with 38 Table of Contents merchandise inventories. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 included $111.0 million in interest payments and $200.1 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. During the year ended September 30, 2003, the Companys operating activities provided $354.8 million in cash. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 was principally the result of net income of $441.2 million and non cash items of $271.2 million, offset in part, by a $278.4 million increase in merchandise inventories and a $58.0 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in merchandise inventories reflected inventory required to support the revenue increase. Accounts receivable increased only 1%, excluding changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer additions due to acquired companies, in comparison to the 13% increase in operating revenues. Average days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment increased slightly to 16.9 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 from 16.4 days in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the strong revenue growth of AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, which generally has a higher receivable investment than the core distribution business. Average days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment improved to 39.3 days in fiscal 2002 from 43.5 days in the prior year as a result of the continued improvements in centralized billing and collection practices. Non cash items of $271.2 million included $127.2 million of deferred income taxes. The tax planning strategies implemented by the Company enabled the Company to lower its current tax payments and liability while increasing its deferred taxes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 included $134.2 million in interest payments and $118.4 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $203.4 million, $189.3 million and $90.6 million, respectively, and related principally to the construction of the new distribution facilities, investments in warehouse expansions and improvements, information technology and warehouse automation. The Company estimates that it will spend approximately $125 million to $150 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2006. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company paid $39.0 million for the remaining 40% equity interest in International Physician Networks (IPN), a physician education and management consulting company, that it did not previously own. Additionally, the Company paid approximately $13.7 million in cash for MedSelect, Inc., a provider of automated medication and supply dispensing cabinets, and $16.6 million in cash for Imedex, Inc., an accredited provider of continuing medical education for physicians. During fiscal 2003, the Company acquired Anderson Packaging Inc. (Anderson), a leading provider of physician and retail contracted packaging services to pharmaceutical manufacturers. The purchase price was approximately $100.1 million, which included the repayment of Anderson debt of $13.8 million and $0.8 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition. The Company paid part of the purchase price by issuing 814,145 shares of its common stock with an aggregate market value of $55.6 million. The Company paid the remaining purchase price, which was approximately $44.5 million, in cash. During fiscal 2003, the Company acquired an additional 40% equity interest in IPN and satisfied the residual contingent obligation for its initial 20% equity interest for an aggregate $24.7 million in cash. During fiscal 2003, the Company acquired US Bioservices Corporation (US Bio), a national pharmaceutical products and services provider focused on the management of high cost complex therapies and reimbursement support for a total base purchase price of $160.2 million, which included the repayment of US Bio debt of $14.8 million and $1.5 million of transaction costs associated with this acquisition. The Company paid part of the base purchase price by issuing 2,399,091 shares of its common stock with an aggregate market value of $131.0 million. The Company paid the remaining $29.2 million of the base purchase price in cash. In July 2003, a contingent payment of $2.5 million was paid in cash by the Company. During fiscal 2003, the Company acquired Bridge Medical, Inc., a leading provider of barcode enabled point of care software designed to reduce medication errors, to enhance the Companys offerings in the pharmaceutical supply channel, for a total base purchase price of $28.4 million, which included $0.7 million of transaction costs associated with this acquisition. The Company paid part of the base purchase price by issuing 401,780 shares of its common stock with an aggregate market value of $22.9 million and the remaining base purchase price was paid with $5.5 million of cash. During fiscal 2003, the Company also used cash of $3.0 million to purchase three smaller companies related to the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and paid $9.8 million to eliminate the right of the former stockholders of AutoMed Technologies, Inc. (AutoMed) to receive up to $55.0 million in contingent payments based on AutoMed achieving defined earnings targets through the end of calendar 2004. Cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 included $36.7 million from sale leaseback transactions entered into by the Company with a financial institution. Additionally, cash provided by investing 39 Table of Contents activities included $14.6 million from the sale of substantially all of the assets of Bridge Medical, Inc. and the sale of Rita Ann Distributors. In September 2005, the Company issued its 2012 Notes and its 2015 Notes for total proceeds of $895.5 million. These proceeds were used to finance the early retirement of the 7 1/4% Notes and the 8 1/8% Notes, including the payment of premiums and other costs, for a total of $902.3 million. Additionally, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company paid $100 million to redeem the Bergen 7 1/4% Senior Notes and repaid the remaining $180.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. In May 2005, the Companys board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $450 million of its outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions and to compliance with the stock repurchase restrictions contained in the indentures governing the Companys senior notes and in the credit agreement for the Companys senior credit facility. Through June 30, 2005, the Company had purchased $94.2 million of its common stock under this program for a weighted average price of $65.50. In August 2005, the Companys board of directors authorized an increase to the amount available under this program by approximately $394 million, bringing total remaining availability to $750 million, and the total repurchase program to approximately $844 million. The increase in repurchase authority was subject to the completion of the tender and repurchase of the Companys $500 million principal amount 8.125% senior notes due 2008 and $300 million principal amount 7.25% senior notes due 2012 and the offering and sale of $400 million principal amount 5.625% senior notes due 2012 and $500 million principal amount 5.875% senior notes due 2015 (collectively, the Refinancing). The Refinancing was completed in September 2005. As of September 30, 2005, the Company has $750 million of remaining authorization to repurchase its common stock under this program. In February 2005, the Companys board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 5.7 million shares (substantially equivalent to the number of common stock shares issued in connection with the conversion of the 5% notes) of its outstanding common stock, subject to market conditions. In February 2005, the Company acquired 0.4 million shares in the open market for a total of $25.9 million. In addition, on March 30, 2005, the Company entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) transaction with a financial institution to purchase the remaining 5.3 million shares immediately from the financial institution at a cost of $293.8 million. The financial institution subsequently purchased an equivalent number of shares in the open market through April 21, 2005. The ASR transaction was completed on April 21, 2005; as a result, the Company paid the financial institution a cash settlement of $16.6 million. The Company had acquired all the shares authorized under this program for a total of $336.3 million, which includes the above cash settlement of $16.6 million. The cash settlement was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital. In August 2004, the Companys board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $500 million of its outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company had acquired 2.8 million shares of its Common Stock for $144.7 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company acquired 6.5 million shares of its common stock under this program for $355.3 million. As of September 30, 2005, the Company had acquired 9.3 million shares of its common stock to complete the $500 million repurchase program. As previously described, the Company used $300 million to redeem the Subordinated Notes and $8.4 million to redeem the 6 7/8% Notes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. Additionally, the Company repaid $60 million of the Term Facility in fiscal 2004. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company issued the aforementioned $300 million of 7 1/4% Notes. The Company used the net proceeds of the 7 1/4% Notes to repay $15 million of the Term Facility, to repay $150 million in aggregate principal of the Bergen 7 3/8% senior notes and redeem the PharMerica 8 3/8% senior subordinated notes due 2008 at a redemption price equal to 104.19% of the $123.5 million principal amount. The Company also repaid an additional $45 million of the Term Facility, as scheduled. The Company has paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.025 per share on its common stock since the first quarter of fiscal 2002. On November 15, 2005, the Companys board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 100% and declared a dividend of $0.05 per share, which will be paid on December 12, 2005 to stockholders of record as of close of business on November 25, 2005. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Companys board of directors and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. 40 Table of Contents Market Risk The Companys most significant market risk is the effect of changing interest rates. The Company manages this risk by using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. At September 30, 2005, the Company had $897.7 million of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.8% and $55.0 million of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the Companys working capital requirements. The Company periodically evaluates various financial instruments that could mitigate a portion of its exposure to variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. There were no such financial instruments in effect at September 30, 2005. For every $100 million of unhedged variable rate debt outstanding, a 45 basis point increase in interest rates (one tenth of the average variable rate at September 30, 2005) would increase the Companys annual interest expense by $0.45 million. Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which requires companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments (including employee stock options) at fair value for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. In April 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a new rule allowing public companies to delay the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 123R, using the modified prospective transition method beginning on October 1, 2005, and therefore, will begin to expense the fair value of all outstanding options over their remaining vesting periods to the extent the options are not fully vested as of the adoption date and will expense the fair value of all future options granted subsequent to September 30, 2005 over their service periods. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than an operating cash flow as currently required. The Company estimates it will record pre tax share based compensation expense of approximately $14 million in fiscal 2006. This estimate may be impacted by potential changes to the structure of the Companys share based compensation plans which could impact the number of stock options granted in fiscal 2006, changes in valuation assumptions, the market price of the Companys common stock, among other things and, as a result, the actual pre tax share based compensation expense in fiscal 2006 may differ from the Companys current estimate.
