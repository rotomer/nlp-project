ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein. In November 2005, the Company declared a two for one stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock. The stock split occurred in the form of a 100% stock dividend, whereby each stockholder received one additional share for each share owned. The shares were distributed on December 28, 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 13, 2005. All applicable share and per share data in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this stock split. The Company is a pharmaceutical services company providing drug distribution and related healthcare services and solutions to its pharmacy, physician, and manufacturer customers, which currently are based primarily in the United States and Canada. The Company also provides pharmaceuticals to long term care and workers compensation patients. The Company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers. Substantially all of the Companys operations are located in the United States and Canada. The Company also has packaging operations located in the United Kingdom. In October 2005, the Company acquired Trent Drugs (Wholesale) Ltd. (Trent), a Canadian wholesaler of pharmaceutical products. The acquisition of Trent provided the Company a solid foundation to expand its pharmaceutical distribution capability into the Canadian marketplace. In January 2006, the Company changed the name of Trent to AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation (ABCC). In March 2006, ABCC acquired substantially all of the assets of Asenda Pharmaceutical Supplies Ltd. (Asenda), a Canadian pharmaceutical distributor that operated primarily in British Columbia and Alberta. The Asenda acquisition strengthened the Companys position in Western Canada. In September 2006, ABCC acquired another Canadian distributor, Rep Pharm, Inc., which distributes pharmaceuticals primarily to retail community pharmacies in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Alberta. This acquisition continues the Companys strategic focus on the pharmaceutical supply channel in Canada. In February 2006, the Company acquired Network for Medical Communication & Research, LLC (NMCR), a privately held provider of accredited continuing medical education (CME) for physicians and analytical research for the oncology market. The acquisition of NMCR expanded the Companys presence in its market leading oncology distribution and services businesses and complements Imedex, the Companys accredited CME business. Additionally, in March 2006, the Company acquired Brecon Pharmaceuticals Limited (Brecon), a United Kingdom based provider of contract packaging and clinical trial materials (CTM) services for pharmaceutical manufacturers. The acquisition of Brecon enhanced the Companys packaging business and provides the added capability to offer pharmaceutical manufacturers contract packaging and CTM services. 22 Table of Contents In October 2006, the Company and Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (Kindred) signed a master transaction agreement to combine their respective institutional pharmacy businesses, PharMerica Long Term Care and Kindred Pharmacy Services (KPS), into a new, independent, publicly traded company. The proposed transaction is intended to be tax free to the stockholders of both the Company and Kindred. The transaction is currently expected to be completed in the first calendar quarter of 2007. The new company would be the second largest in the institutional pharmacy services market with annual revenues of approximately $1.9 billion and a customer base of approximately 330,000 licensed beds in 41 states. The proposed combination does not include the Companys workers compensation business (PMSI), which is reported in its PharMerica segment. The transaction would begin with PharMerica Long Term Care and KPS each borrowing up to $150 million and providing a one time distribution back to their respective parents. The cash distribution is intended to be all or substantially tax free to the Company. After the borrowing and distribution, each of the institutional pharmacy businesses would be separately spun off as independent companies, each with 100 percent stock ownership by the stockholders of their respective parents, followed immediately by the independent companies combining in a stock for stock exchange which would result in the Companys and Kindreds stockholders each owning 50 percent of the new company (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further details). The master transaction agreement provides that at closing of the transaction, the Company will enter into a pharmaceutical distribution agreement with the new company, and Kindred will enter into an agreement to provide information and support services to the new company. The master transaction agreement also provides that at closing, Kindred, the Company and the new company will enter into agreements for the provision of certain transition services for a limited transition period following consummation of the transaction. Consummation of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including the effectiveness of a registration statement with respect to the shares of the new companys common stock, receipt of financing for the new company and for the one time cash distributions to the Company and Kindred, and receipt of a favorable determination from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the tax free nature of the transaction. There can be no assurance that all conditions to completion of the transaction will be met. In October 2006, the Company acquired Health Advocates, Inc. (Health Advocates), a leading provider of Medicare set aside cost containment services to insurance payors primarily within the workers compensation industry. Health Advocates was renamed PMSI MSA Services, Inc. (PMSI MSA Services) and will operate under the Companys PMSI services business. The addition of PMSI MSA Services, combined with our leading pharmacy and clinical solutions, gives the Companys workers compensation business the ability to provide its customers with a fully integrated Medicare set aside solution. In October 2006, the Company acquired I.G.G. of America, Inc. (IgG), a specialty pharmacy and infusion services business specializing in the blood derivative IVIG. The addition of IgG supports the Companys strategy of building its specialty pharmaceutical services to manufacturers. In November 2006, the Company acquired Access M.D., Inc. (AMD), a Canadian company that provides services, including reimbursement support, third party logistics and nursing support services to manufacturers of specialty pharmaceuticals, such as injectable and biological therapies. The acquisition of AMD expands our specialty services businesses into Canada and complements the distribution services offered by ABCC. The Companys operations are comprised of two reportable segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica. Pharmaceutical Distribution The Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment is comprised of three operating segments, which include the operations of AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC), the AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG) and the AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group (ABPG). Servicing both pharmaceutical 23 Table of Contents manufacturers and healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. ABDC distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals, over the counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order facilities, clinics, alternate site facilities and other customers. In an effort to further protect the safety of the supply channel, we purchase all pharmaceuticals only from manufacturers. ABDC also provides pharmacy management and consulting services and scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment, medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. The Company has transitioned its pharmaceutical distribution business to a fee for service model whereby it is compensated for the services it provides manufacturers versus one that is dependent upon manufacturer price increases. The fee for service model is intended to improve the efficiency and transparency of the supply channel and may establish a more predictable earnings pattern for ABDC, while expanding our service relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers. As of September 30, 2006, ABDC had signed fee for service agreements with substantially all of the large branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. During fiscal 2006, more than 75% of ABDCs brand name manufacturer gross margin was not contingent on manufacturer price increases. ABSG, through a number of individual operating businesses, provides distribution and other services to physicians and alternate care providers who specialize in a variety of disease states, such as oncology. ABSG also distributes vaccines, other injectables, plasma and other blood products. In addition, through its manufacturer services and physician and patient services businesses, ABSG provides a number of commercialization, third party logistics, group purchasing services, and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers, reimbursement consulting, data analytics, practice management, and physician education. ABSGs business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, including oncology drugs administered by physicians. Since ABSG provides a number of services to or through physicians, this could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for ABSG. There can be no assurance that ABSG will retain or replace all of the revenue currently going through the physician channel or that such revenue will be as profitable. ABPG consists of American Health Packaging, Anderson Packaging (Anderson) and Brecon. American Health Packaging delivers unit dose, punch card, unit of use and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. American Health Packagings largest customer is ABDC, and, as a result, their operations are closely aligned with the operations of ABDC. Anderson is a leading provider of contract packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Brecon is a United Kingdom based provider of contract packaging and CTM services for pharmaceutical manufacturers. PharMerica The PharMerica segment includes the operations of the PharMerica long term care business (Long Term Care) and PMSI. Long Term Care is a leading national dispenser of pharmaceutical products and services to patients in long term care and alternate site settings, including skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and residential living communities. Long Term Cares institutional pharmacy business involves the purchase of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals, principally from our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, and the dispensing of those products to residents in long term care and alternate site facilities. Unlike hospitals, most long term and alternate care facilities do not have onsite pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs but depend instead on institutional pharmacies, such as Long Term Care, to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and 24 Table of Contents to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication. Long Term Care pharmacies dispense pharmaceuticals in patient specific packaging in accordance with physician orders. In addition, Long Term Care provides infusion therapy services, as well as formulary management and other pharmacy consulting services. The Company continues to evaluate the effect that the MMA transition is having on its Long Term Care business. The MMA significantly expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Beginning in 2006, Medicare beneficiaries became eligible to enroll in prescription drug plans that are offered by private entities and became eligible for varying levels of coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. While the above has had a positive effect on business volume during fiscal 2006, its impact has been mitigated by additional costs incurred relating to the MMA transition. Additionally, Medicaid drug coverage was affected by the new Medicare Part D drug benefit that was implemented in 2006, since Medicare Part D, not Medicaid, covers most outpatient drug expenses for beneficiaries who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid coverage (so called dual eligibles), including dual eligibles residing in nursing homes. CMS continues to question pharmacies receipt of access/performance rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to prescriptions covered under the Medicare Part D benefit. In addition, the DRA could reduce payments to Long Term Care customers. Among other things, the DRA will reduce certain bad debt payments to Medicare skilled nursing facilities and strengthen asset transfer restrictions for people seeking to qualify for Medicaid long term care coverage. In addition, new rules that will go into effect on January 1, 2007 may decrease Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs. If the Company fails to successfully develop and implement such plans, this change in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the DRA could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. As previously discussed, in October 2006, the Company and Kindred signed a master transaction agreement to combine their respective institutional pharmacy businesses, PharMerica Long Term Care and KPS, into a new, independent, publicly traded company (see page 23 for further details). PMSI provides mail order and on line pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers compensation programs, and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors. PMSI services include home delivery of prescription drugs, medical supplies and equipment, and an array of computer software solutions to reduce the payors administrative costs. The recent addition of PMSI MSA Services gives the PMSI business the ability to provide its customers with a fully integrated Medicare set aside solution. 25 Table of Contents AmerisourceBergen Corporation Summary Segment Information Operating Revenue Fiscal year ended September 30, 2006vs.2005Change 2005vs.2004Change (dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 55,907,552 $ 49,319,371 $ 48,113,015 13 % 3 % PharMerica 1,668,308 1,571,369 1,575,255 6 Intersegment eliminations (902,920 ) (878,142 ) (875,818 ) (3 ) Total $ 56,672,940 $ 50,012,598 $ 48,812,452 13 % 2 % Operating Income Fiscal year ended September 30, 2006vs.2005Change 2005 vs. 2004Change (dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 644,202 $ 532,887 $ 748,625 21 % (29 )% PharMerica 83,745 91,947 121,846 (9 ) (25 ) Facility consolidations, employee severance and other (20,123 ) (22,723 ) (7,517 ) 11 (202 ) Gain on antitrust litigation settlements 40,882 40,094 38,005 2 5 Impairment charge (5,259 ) n/a n/a Total $ 748,706 $ 636,946 $ 900,959 18 % (29 )% Percentages of operating revenue: Pharmaceutical Distribution Gross profit 3.08 % 3.03 % 3.43 % Operating expenses 1.93 % 1.95 % 1.87 % Operating income 1.15 % 1.08 % 1.56 % PharMerica Gross profit 28.01 % 28.40 % 30.45 % Operating expenses 22.99 % 22.54 % 22.72 % Operating income 5.02 % 5.85 % 7.74 % AmerisourceBergen Corporation Gross profit 3.94 % 3.96 % 4.44 % Operating expenses 2.62 % 2.69 % 2.59 % Operating income 1.32 % 1.27 % 1.85 % Year ended September 30, 2006 compared with Year ended September 30, 2005 Consolidated Results Operating revenue, which excludes bulk deliveries, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased 13% to $56.7 billion from $50.0 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. Bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the Company at the express direction of the customer, and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers warehouse sites (i.e., drop shipment) or shipments from the supplier to the Company for immediate shipment to the customers warehouse sites (i.e., cross dock shipment). Bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 decreased 1% to $4.5 billion from $4.6 billion in the prior fiscal year due to a decrease in demand from the Companys largest bulk customer. The Company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has the ultimate responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the products 26 Table of Contents purchased, and bears full risk of delivery and loss for products, whether the products are drop shipped or shipped cross dock. The Company also bears full credit risk associated with the creditworthiness of any bulk delivery customer. As a result, and in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, the Company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues. Due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries, fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins. However, revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the Companys cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the Company and payments by the Company to its suppliers. In connection with the transition to a fee for service model, the Company changed its method of recognizing cash discounts and other related manufacturer incentives, effective October 1, 2004. Prior to October 1, 2004, ABDC had recognized cash discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold when earned, which was primarily upon payment of vendor invoices. Since October 1, 2004, ABDC has been recording cash discounts as a component of inventory cost and recognizing such discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold upon the sale of the inventory. We believe the change in accounting method has provided a better matching of inventory cost to revenue, particularly as inventory turnover rates have continued to improve. The Company recorded a $10.2 million charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting (net of tax of $6.3 million) in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. This $10.2 million cumulative effect charge reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.05 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. Gross profit of $2,231.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased 13% from $1,980.2 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue, an increase in compensation under our fee for service agreements and growth of our generic programs. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was 3.94%, as compared to 3.96% in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to the strong growth in business with a few of our larger, lower margin customers. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized gains of $40.9 million and $40.1 million, respectively, from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. These gains, which are net of attorney fees and estimated payments due to other parties, were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and contributed 2% of gross profit for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. The Company is unable to estimate future gains, if any, it will recognize as a result of antitrust litigation (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further details). Distribution, selling and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization (DSAD&A) of $1,463.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased by 11% from $1,315.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in DSAD&A in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 from the prior fiscal year was primarily related to our growth in operating revenue, operating expenses of our acquired companies, investments to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures within ABDC, and share based compensation expense related to the current year adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment. As a percentage of operating revenue, DSAD&A in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was 2.58%, compared to 2.63% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in the DSAD&A percentage in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to productivity gains achieved throughout the Companys distribution network as a result of the Optimiz&reg; program, offset in part by investments made to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures within ABDC, expenses of our acquired companies, share based compensation expense, and an increase in PharMericas operating expenses related to Medicare Part D implementation issues. In 2001, the Company developed an integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company decided to outsource a significant portion of its information technology activities as part of the integration plan. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company incurred a total of approximately $21 million of 27 Table of Contents transition costs, which included employee severance and other contract expenses, in connection with this outsourcing plan. The Companys current plan is to have a distribution facility network in the U.S. numbering in the mid 20s by the end of fiscal 2007. The plan includes building six new facilities (all of which have been completed and are fully operational) and closing facilities (29 of which have been closed through September 30, 2006). The Company had a total of 28 distribution facilities in the U.S. as of September 30, 2006. The Company anticipates closing two or three additional facilities in fiscal 2007. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company closed four distribution facilities and eliminated duplicative administrative functions (the fiscal 2004 initiatives). During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company announced plans to continue to consolidate and eliminate certain administrative functions, and to outsource a significant portion of the Companys information technology activities (the fiscal 2005 initiatives). During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the Company closed six distribution facilities (the fiscal 2006 initiatives), incurred expenses relating to the planned spin off of PharMerica Long Term Care, realized a $17.3 million gain from the sale of the former Bergen Brunswig headquarters building in Orange, California, and incurred a charge of $13.9 million for an increase in a compensation accrual due to an adverse decision in an employment related dispute with a former Bergen Brunswig chief executive officer whose employment was terminated in 1999 (see Bergen Brunswig Matter under Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for further information). The following table illustrates the charges incurred by the Company relating to facility consolidations, employee severance, and other for the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Facility consolidations and employee severance $ 4,271 $ 10,491 $ 7,517 Information technology transition costs 9,218 12,232 Costs relating to the long term care business transaction 6,634 Total facility consolidations, employee severance and other $ 20,123 $ 22,723 $ 7,517 The gain realized on the sale of the Bergen Brunswig headquarters and the compensation expense recognized in connection with the former Bergen Brunswig chief executive officer are components of the facility consolidations and employee severance line in the above table in fiscal 2006. Through September 30, 2006, approximately 440 employees had been given termination notices as a result of the fiscal 2006 initiatives, of which approximately 400 have been terminated. As a result of the fiscal 2005 initiatives and fiscal 2004 initiatives, approximately 640 employees were terminated. Additional amounts for integration initiatives will be recognized in subsequent periods as facilities to be consolidated are identified and specific plans are approved and announced. The Company paid a total of $20.6 million and $13.5 million for employee severance, lease cancellation and other costs in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to the aforementioned integration plan. Remaining unpaid amounts of $27.9 million for employee severance, lease cancellation and other costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2006. Most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time, generally not to exceed 12 months, while others may receive a lump sum payment. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.3 million relating to certain intangible assets held by ABDC. Operating income of $748.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased by 18% compared to $636.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The Companys operating income as a percentage of 28 Table of Contents operating revenue was 1.32% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 compared to 1.27% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in gross profit in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other increased operating income by $20.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 and increased operating income as a percentage of operating revenue by 4 basis points. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other, and the impairment charge increased operating income by $12.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 and increased operating income as a percentage of operating revenue by 2 basis points. Other income of $4.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 primarily included a $3.4 million gain resulting from an eminent domain settlement and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of an equity investment less losses incurred relating to another equity investment. Interest expense, net decreased 78% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 to $12.5 million from $57.2 million in the prior fiscal year. Interest expense and interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 were as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 Amount Weighted AverageInterest Rate Amount Weighted AverageInterest Rate Interest expense $ 65,874 5.64 % $ 76,394 7.14 % Interest income (53,410 ) 4.03 % (19,171 ) 2.23 % Interest expense, net $ 12,464 $ 57,223 Interest expense declined by $10.5 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of the decline in weighted average interest rates resulting from the Companys fiscal 2005 long term debt refinancing. Interest income increased by $34.2 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of an increase in the Companys average cash and short term investments and an increase in market interest rates. The Companys average invested cash and short term investments during fiscal 2006 and 2005 was $1.3 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. The Companys net interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in interest rates and strategic decisions made by the Company to deploy its invested cash and short term investments. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company recorded a $111.9 million loss related to the early retirement of debt. Income tax expense of $272.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 reflects an effective income tax rate of 36.8%, versus 37.7% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by an increase in the amount of our tax free investments in comparison to our taxable investments, including cash and cash equivalents and certain other favorable tax adjustments. The Company expects to have an effective income tax rate between 37% and 38% in future periods, which will primarily depend on our mix of tax free and taxable investments, including cash and cash equivalents. Income from continuing operations of $468.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased by 60% from $291.9 million in the prior fiscal year before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.26 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 represents a 65% increase from $1.37 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements, the eminent domain settlement, the sale of an equity investment and the favorable tax adjustments, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other increased income from continuing operations by $23.2 million and increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.11 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 29 Table of Contents 2006. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other, the impairment charge and the loss on early retirement of debt decreased income from continuing operations by $64.2 million and decreased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.30 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. Loss from discontinued operations of $0.3 million, net of tax, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, relates to certain adjustments made by the Company in connection with the December 2004 sale of the Companys Rita Ann cosmetics distribution business as well as the July 2005 sale of substantially all of the assets of Bridge Medical, Inc. (Bridge). Loss from discontinued operations of $17.1 million, net of tax, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 includes operating losses incurred in connection with the Rita Ann and Bridge businesses. The Company incurred a $6.5 million loss, net of tax, on the sale of the Rita Ann business, and a $4.6 million loss, net of tax, on the sale of the Bridge business, both of which are reflected in the loss from discontinued operations in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. Net income of $467.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased by 77% from $264.6 million in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share of $2.25 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased by 81% as compared to $1.24 per share in the prior fiscal year. The increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the reduced number of weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the Companys purchase of its common stock in connection with its stock buyback programs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) offset in part by the increase in the number of stock option exercises. Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment Results Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue of $55.9 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased 13% from $49.3 billion in the prior fiscal year. The Companys acquisitions, primarily ABCC, contributed 1.5% of the operating revenue growth in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006. Our operating revenue growth was higher than the market growth rate, and was driven by growth from a few of our larger institutional customers within ABDC, the continued strong growth of ABSG, principally in its distribution businesses, and new customers in all customer classes. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, 58% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 42% was from sales to retail customers; this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 57% institutional and 43% retail. In comparison with the prior year results, sales to institutional customers increased 16% primarily due to the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business and the growth of sales to a few of our larger alternate site institutional customers within ABDC. Sales to retail customers increased 10% over the prior year. The Companys acquisitions contributed 4% of the retail customer growth. This segments growth largely reflects U.S. pharmaceutical industry conditions, including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset, in part, by the increased use of lower priced generics. The segments growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix. Industry sales in the United States, as estimated by industry data firm IMS Healthcare, Inc. (IMS), are expected to grow between 4% and 5% in 2007 and between 5% and 8% over the next five years. IMS also indicated that certain sectors of the market, such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals will grow faster than the overall market. As previously mentioned, our revenue growth for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 exceeded market growth primarily due to the growth of a few of our larger institutional customers within ABDC as well as the strong growth of ABSG. In July 2006, the Company discontinued servicing two customer accounts, which contributed $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion of the segments operating revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Companys Specialty Group has been growing at rates in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth. The Specialty Groups operating revenue grew 33% to $9.9 billion for the fiscal year ended 30 Table of Contents September 30, 2006 from $7.4 billion in the prior fiscal year. The majority of this Groups revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, such as oncology. Additionally, the Specialty Group distributes vaccines, plasma and other blood products. The Specialty Groups oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the Specialty Groups most significant contributor to revenue growth. The Specialty Groups business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, including oncology drugs administered by physicians. Since the Specialty Group provides a number of services to or through physicians, this could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for the Specialty Group. The Company currently expects that its operating revenue growth in fiscal 2007 will decline from its 13% growth rate in fiscal 2006 to a range of 7% to 9%. ABDC revenues are expected to grow with the overall pharmaceutical market growth rate and the ABSG growth rate, which was 33% in fiscal 2006, is expected to decline to the mid to high teens, which is in line with the expected growth of the biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceuticals market in 2007. Future operating revenue growth will continue to be affected by competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on reimbursement rates, changes in Federal government rules and regulations, and industry growth trends, such as the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers. Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit of $1,723.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased by 15% from $1,493.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in operating revenue, an increase in compensation under our fee for service agreements, and the growth of our generic programs. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was 3.08%, as compared to 3.03% in the prior fiscal year. The 5 basis point improvement was primarily due to our increase in compensation under our fee for service agreements, the growth of our generic programs, and contributions from our acquisitions. Customer mix, including the higher than average growth rate of a few of our larger, lower margin customers partially offset the aforementioned improvements. The Companys cost of goods sold includes a last in, first out (LIFO) provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the inventory balance declined, which resulted in liquidation of LIFO layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior year. The effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2005 was to decrease cost of goods sold by $30.6 million. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating expenses of $1,079.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased by 12% from $961.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses is primarily related to our growth in operating revenue and the operating expenses of our acquired companies and share based compensation expense related to the current year adoption of SFAS No. 123R. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 were 1.93%, as compared to 1.95% in the prior fiscal year, as productivity gains achieved throughout the Companys distribution network as a result of our Optimiz&reg; program were partially offset by our acquisitions, our investments made to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures, and share based compensation expense. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income of $644.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased by 21% from $532.9 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was 1.15%, as compared to 1.08% in the prior fiscal year. The increase over the prior year percentage was due to an increase in gross profit and reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, as compared to the prior fiscal year, as discussed above. PharMerica Segment Results PharMerica operating revenue of $1,668.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased by 6% from $1,571.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating revenue was primarily driven by 31 Table of Contents the Long Term Care business, which grew 7% as a result of an increase in the number of beds served, higher patient acuity and drug price inflation. Long Term Cares operating revenues were $1,211.5 million and $1,131.5 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. PMSI operating revenue increased by 4% to $456.8 million in the current fiscal year from $439.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The future operating revenue growth rate will likely continue to be impacted by competitive pressures, changes in the regulatory environment (including the reimbursement changes that have been implemented pursuant to the MMA, including Medicare Part D, and the DRA) and the pharmaceutical inflation rate. PharMerica gross profit of $467.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased by 5% from $446.2 million in the prior fiscal year and was driven by an increase in Long Term Cares gross profit, offset by a decline in PMSI gross profit. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was 28.01%, as compared to 28.40% in the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily driven by industry competitive pressures in both the Long Term Care and the PMSI businesses and lower rates of reimbursement for services provided by the PMSI business. Long Term Care gross profit of $357.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased by 8% from $330.8 million in the prior fiscal year and was primarily driven by the increase in operating revenue. PMSI gross profit of $110.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 decreased by 4% from $115.4 million in the prior fiscal year and was primarily driven by industry competitive pressures and lower rates of reimbursement from third party payors. Future gross profit will likely be impacted by industry competitive pressures and continued downward pressure on rates of reimbursement for services provided by both the Long Term Care and PMSI businesses, and the amounts of rebates available to Long Term Care from pharmaceutical manufacturers and the portion of any such rebates that may be retained by Long Term Care. PharMerica operating expenses of $383.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased 8% from $354.3 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses increased to 22.99% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 from 22.54% in the prior fiscal year. Long Term Care operating expenses of $324.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased 10% from $296.4 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase was largely due to operating revenue growth, an increase in bad debt expense of $14.5 million and additional costs related to the implementation of Medicare Part D under the MMA, which became effective on January 1, 2006. Long Term Cares bad debt expense increased over the prior year primarily due to billing and collection issues relating to the MMA transition and the negative impact that Texas Medicaid changes had on certain of its nursing home customers. PMSI operating expenses of $58.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 increased 2% from $57.9 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in operating revenue and was partially offset by a $4.3 million reduction in bad debt expense primarily due to improvements made in credit and cash application management and a $3.2 million reduction in sales and use tax liability due to favorable settlements. PharMerica operating income of $83.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 decreased 9% from $91.9 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was 5.02%, as compared to 5.85% in the prior fiscal year. Long Term Care operating income of $32.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 decreased 6% from $34.5 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in its operating expenses. PMSI operating income of $51.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 decreased 11% from $57.4 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decrease in its gross profit. We believe that the operating margins of Long Term Care and PMSI will continue to be impacted by industry competitive pressures and changes in the regulatory environment. Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to PharMerica. ABDC is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to PharMerica. 32 Table of Contents Year ended September 30, 2005 compared with Year ended September 30, 2004 Consolidated Results Operating revenue, which excludes bulk deliveries, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 increased 2% to $50.0 billion from $48.8 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. Bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the Company at the express direction of the customer, and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers warehouse sites or shipments from the supplier to the Company for immediate shipment to the customers warehouse sites. Bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 increased 6% to $4.6 billion from $4.3 billion in the prior fiscal year due to an increase in demand from the Companys largest bulk customer. In connection with the transition to a fee for service model, the Company changed its method of recognizing cash discounts and other related manufacturer incentives, effective October 1, 2004. Prior to October 1, 2004, ABDC had recognized cash discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold when earned, which was primarily upon payment of vendor invoices. Since October 1, 2004, ABDC has been recording cash discounts as a component of inventory cost and recognizing such discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold upon the sale of the inventory. We believe the change in accounting method has provided a better matching of inventory cost to revenue, particularly as inventory turnover rates have continued to improve. The Company recorded a $10.2 million charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting (net of tax of $6.3 million) in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. This $10.2 million cumulative effect charge reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.05 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. Gross profit of $1,980.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased 9% from $2,166.4 million in the prior fiscal year. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized gains of $40.1 million and $38.0 million, respectively, from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. These gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and contributed 2% of gross profit for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 3.96%, as compared to the prior year percentage of 4.44%. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflects declines in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and PharMerica segments due to a decline in profits related to pharmaceutical price increases and other buy side profits, changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization (DSAD&A) of $1,315.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 increased by 4.6% from $1,258.0 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, DSAD&A in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 2.63%, compared to 2.58% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in the DSAD&A and the DSAD&A percentage in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment DSAD&A, including bad debt expenses. Total bad debt expense increased to $33.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 from a benefit of $10.3 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to a $15.5 million increase in bad debt expense relating to one of the operating companies within the Specialty Group. Additionally, the prior years bad debt expense was favorably impacted by $26.6 million of customer recoveries. In 2001, the Company developed an integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company decided to outsource a significant portion of its information technology activities as part of the integration plan. The 33 Table of Contents Companys current plan is to have a distribution facility network in the U.S. numbering in the mid 20s by the end of fiscal 2007. The Company successfully completed the outsourcing of those information technology activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006. The plan includes building six new facilities and closing facilities. During fiscal 2005 and 2004, the Company closed six and four distribution facilities, respectively. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company closed six distribution facilities and eliminated certain administrative and operational functions (the fiscal 2003 initiatives). During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 the Company recorded $0.9 million of employee severance costs relating to the fiscal 2003 initiatives. Through September 30, 2004, approximately 780 employees were given termination notices as a result of the fiscal 2003 initiatives, of which substantially all had been terminated. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company closed four distribution facilities and eliminated duplicative administrative functions (the fiscal 2004 initiatives). During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company recorded $5.4 million of employee severance costs in connection with the fiscal 2004 initiatives. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company closed six distribution facilities and eliminated certain administrative functions, and to outsource a significant portion of the Companys information technology activities (the fiscal 2005 initiatives). As of September 30, 2005, approximately 700 employees had received termination notices as a result of the 2004 and 2005 initiatives, of which approximately 630 had been terminated. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company recorded $13.3 million of employee severance and lease cancellation costs primarily related to the 2005 initiatives and $9.4 million of transition costs associated with the outsourcing of information technology activities. The Company paid a total of $13.5 million and $9.5 million for employee severance, lease cancellation and other costs in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to the aforementioned integration plan. Most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time, generally not to exceed 12 months, while others may receive a lump sum payment. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.3 million relating to certain intangible assets within the technology operations of ABDC. Operating income of $636.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased by 29% compared to $901.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The Companys operating income as a percentage of operating revenue was 1.27% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 compared to 1.85% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in operating income was primarily due to the decline in gross profit. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other, and the impairment charge increased operating income by $12.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The gain on the antitrust litigation settlement, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other, increased operating income by $30.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, a technology company in which the Company had an equity investment sold substantially all of its assets and paid a liquidating dividend. As a result, the Company recorded a gain of $8.4 million in other income during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. 34 Table of Contents Interest expense, net decreased 49% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 to $57.2 million from $112.7 million in the prior fiscal year. Interest expense and interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in thousands): 2005 2004 Amount Weighted AverageInterest Rate Amount Weighted AverageInterest Rate Interest expense $ 76,394 7.14 % $ 117,923 6.40 % Interest income (19,171 ) 2.23 % (5,219 ) 1.00 % Interest expense, net $ 57,223 $ 112,704 Interest expense declined by $41.5 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 due to a decline in average borrowings from $1.7 billion in fiscal 2004 to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2005. Interest income increased by $14.0 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 as a result of an increase in the Companys average cash and short term investments and an increase in market interest rates. The Companys average invested cash and short term investments during fiscal 2005 and 2004 were $0.9 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. The reductions in average borrowings and the increase in the Companys cash and short term investment position were achieved due to the Companys strong cash flows generated from operations, including reduced merchandise inventories resulting from the aforementioned business model transition. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $111.9 million and $23.6 million, respectively, in losses resulting from the early retirement of debt. Income tax expense of $176.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 represents an effective income tax rate of 37.7%, versus 38.4% in the prior fiscal year. The reduction in tax rates resulted from the resolution of certain federal and state income tax issues during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. Income from continuing operations of $291.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased by 39% from $474.9 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decline in operating income and the loss from the early retirement of debt partially offset by the decrease in interest expense. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.37 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 reflects a 34% decrease from $2.06 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other, the impairment charge and the loss on early retirement of debt decreased income from continuing operations by $64.2 million and decreased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.30 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The gain on antitrust litigation settlement less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other and the loss on early retirement of debt increased income from continuing operations by $4.2 million and increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.02 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, relates to the December 2004 sale of the Companys Rita Ann cosmetics distribution business as well as the July 2005 sale of substantially all of the assets of Bridge Medical, Inc. (Bridge). The Company incurred a $6.5 million loss, net of tax, on the sale of the Rita Ann business, and a $4.6 million loss, net of tax, on the sale of the Bridge business, both of which are reflected in the loss from discontinued operations in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. Net income of $264.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased by 43% from $468.4 million in the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share of $1.24 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased by 39% as compared to $2.03 per share in the prior fiscal year. The decline in diluted earnings per share was less than the decline in net income due to the reduced number of weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the Companys purchase of its common stock in connection with its stock buyback programs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) offset in part by the increase in the number of stock option exercises. 35 Table of Contents Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment Results Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue of $49.3 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 increased 3% from $48.1 billion in the prior fiscal year. In fiscal 2004, the Company discontinued servicing the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and AdvancePCS. These former customers contributed 4.8% and 4.4%, respectively, of the segments operating revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. The lost business was offset by the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical distribution business and the market growth of ABDC. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, 57% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 43% was from sales to retail customers; this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 59% institutional and 41% retail. In comparison with the prior year results, sales to institutional customers were flat primarily due to the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical distribution business, offset by the loss of the VA and AdvancePCS business. Sales to retail customers increased 7% over the prior year primarily due to market growth and an increase in sales to one of the Companys larger retail customers. This segments growth largely reflects U.S. pharmaceutical industry conditions, including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset, in part, by the increased use of lower priced generics. The Specialty Groups operating revenue grew 35% to $7.4 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 from $5.5 billion in the prior fiscal year. The segments growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix. The Companys Specialty Group has been growing at rates in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth. The majority of this Groups revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, such as oncology. Additionally, the Specialty Group distributes other physician administered products, vaccines and blood plasma. The Specialty Groups oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the Specialty Groups most significant contributor to revenue growth. Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit of $1,493.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased by 9% from $1,648.7 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 3.03%, as compared to 3.43% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in the buy side component of the gross margin, including a decline in inventory appreciation profits, fewer alternate source and deal opportunities and the loss of the VA business in fiscal 2004. Contributing to the decline in inventory appreciation profits were lower levels of inventory on hand during the current fiscal year as a result of the business model transition, and fewer than expected manufacturer price increases prior to the national election in November 2004. The Companys cost of goods sold includes a last in, first out (LIFO) provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, inventory balances declined, which resulted in liquidation of LIFO layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effects of the liquidations in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were to decrease cost of goods sold by $30.6 million and $10.3 million, respectively. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating expenses of $961.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 increased by 7% from $900.1 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 were 1.95%, as compared to 1.87% in the prior fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of $49.2 million (which included a $15.5 million increase in bad debt relating to one of the operating companies within the Specialty Group) and fiscal 2005 start up costs incurred in connection with the new distribution facilities which were primarily offset by continued productivity gains achieved throughout the Companys distribution network. Additionally, prior years bad debt expense was favorably impacted by a $17.5 million recovery from a large former customer. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income of $532.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased by 29% from $748.6 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 1.08%, as compared to 1.56% in the prior fiscal year. The decline from the prior year percentage was primarily due to a reduction in gross profit. 36 Table of Contents PharMerica Segment Results PharMerica operating revenue of $1,571.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was flat compared to $1,575.3 million in the prior fiscal year. PharMericas operating revenue was impacted by competitive pressures that affected both the Long Term Care and PMSI businesses and increasing reductions in Medicaid reimbursement rates. PharMerica gross profit of $446.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased by 7% from $479.7 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 28.40%, as compared to 30.45% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to industry competitive pressures, and a reduction in the rates of reimbursement for the services provided by PharMerica, which continue to adversely affect gross profit margins in both the PMSI and Long Term Care businesses. PharMerica operating expenses of $354.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased 1% from $357.9 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses decreased slightly to 22.54% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 from 22.72% in the prior fiscal year. PharMericas fiscal 2005 operating expenses were favorably impacted by aggressive cost reductions in response to the decline in operating revenue, including the consolidation of local pharmacy administrative functions to regional centers for the Long Term Care business, a reduction in bad debt expense of $5.5 million due to continued improvements made in credit and collection practices, and continued improvements in operating practices of both the PMSI and Long Term Care businesses. The prior years operating expenses were favorably impacted by a $12.1 million reduction in sales and use tax liability due to favorable audit experience and other settlements. PharMerica operating income of $91.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 decreased 25% from $121.8 million in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was 5.85%, as compared to 7.74% in the prior fiscal year. The decline was due to the aforementioned reduction in the gross profit margin. Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to PharMerica. ABDC is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to PharMerica. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting estimates are those accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing the Companys financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For a complete list of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the Company for its pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, its customers financial strength and credit standing, and payment and default history. Changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in the Companys allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by Company management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate 37 Table of Contents realization of its trade receivables. Each of the Companys business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise. The Company writes off balances against the reserves when collectibility is deemed remote. Each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and the Companys largest business units perform such reviews monthly. There were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. The bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts, net of write offs and recoveries. Schedule II of this Form 10 K sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $36.3 million, $33.4 million and ($10.3) million, respectively. The increase in bad debt expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 primarily related to an increase in bad debt expense in the PharMerica reporting segment offset in part by a decline in bad debt expense in the Pharmaceutical Distribution reporting segment. The increase in PharMericas bad debt expense was driven by the billing and collection issues experienced by Long Term Care relating to the MMA transition and the negative impact that Texas Medicaid changes had on certain of its nursing home customers. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, bad debt expense in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment was significantly impacted due to a $15.5 million increase in bad debt relating to one of the operating companies within the Specialty Group. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, debt expense was favorably impacted by a $17.5 million recovery from a former customer in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, a $9.1 million recovery from a customer in the PharMerica segment, and the continued improvements made in the credit and collection practices in both segments. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2006 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately $3.8 million. Supplier Reserves The Company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due them from the Company. These reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of Company management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to the Company. The Company evaluates the amounts due from its suppliers on a continual basis and adjusts the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2006 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately $6.5 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different than the Companys estimate. Loss Contingencies The Company accrues for loss contingencies related to litigation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The Company regularly reviews loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates. Merchandise Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 83% and 87% of the Companys inventories at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method. If the Company had used the first in, first out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation, which 38 Table of Contents approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $152.6 million and $159.8 million higher than the amounts reported at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, inventory balances declined, which resulted in liquidation of LIFO layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2005 was to decrease cost of goods sold by $30.6 million and increase diluted earnings per share by $0.09. The effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2004 was to decrease cost of goods sold by $10.3 million and increase diluted earnings per share by $0.03. Business Combinations In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The Company engages third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual events. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships, non compete agreements, patents and software technology, will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. In order to test goodwill and intangible assets under SFAS No. 142, a determination of the fair value of the Companys reporting units and intangible assets is required. The Company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value. This impairment test requires the projection and discounting of cash flows, analysis of the Companys market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management. The Companys estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to the business model, or changes in operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect the Companys future financial results. The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, and, as a result, did not record any significant impairment charges. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company performed an impairment test on certain intangible assets within the technology operations of ABDC due to the existence of impairment indicators. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.3 million relating to certain of those intangible assets. The charge was reflected in the Companys results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. The Company completed its required annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and determined that there was no impairment. 39 Table of Contents Share Based Compensation In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R Share Based Payment, using the modified prospective transition method, and, therefore, began to expense the fair value of all options over their remaining vesting periods to the extent the options were not fully vested as of the adoption date and began to expense the fair value of all share based compensation awards granted subsequent to September 30, 2005 over their requisite service periods. The Company utilizes a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based compensation expense, which involves the use of several assumptions, including expected term of the option, future volatility, dividend yield and forfeiture rate. The expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys stock as well as other factors, such as implied volatility. Income Taxes The Companys income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax reserves reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. The Company has established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually. After application of the valuation allowances described above, the Company anticipates that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above. In addition, the Company has established an estimated liability for federal, state and non U.S. income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Uncertainties. The Company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, the Companys tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. The Company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period. The liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances, a thorough research of the technical merits of the Companys arguments and an assessment of the probability of the Company prevailing in its arguments. In all cases, the Company considers previous findings of the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. However, others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued. The significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year. If any of the Companys assumptions or estimates were to change, an increase or decrease in the Companys effective tax rate by 1% on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by $7.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006. 40 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table illustrates the Companys debt structure at September 30, 2006, including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility (in thousands): OutstandingBalance AdditionalAvailability Fixed Rate Debt: $400,000, 5 5/8% senior notes due 2012 $ 398,250 $ $500,000, 5 7/8% senior notes due 2015 497,698 Other 2,952 Total fixed rate debt 898,900 Variable Rate Debt: Blanco revolving credit facility due 2007 55,000 UK revolving credit facility due 2009 28,085 9,362 Canadian revolving credit facility due 2009 113,506 7,245 Senior revolving credit facility due 2009 689,265 Receivables securitization facility due 2007 700,000 Other 3,750 Total variable rate debt 196,591 1,409,622 Total debt, including current portion $ 1,095,491 $ 1,409,622 The Companys $1.6 billion of aggregate availability under its revolving credit facilities and its receivables securitization facility provide sufficient sources of capital to fund the Companys working capital requirements. The Companys aggregate availability was reduced to $1.3 billion as of November 14, 2006 because the Company elected to replace its existing revolving credit facilities with a new five year multi currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the Company further amended its receivables securitization facility such that the amount to be made available was reduced from $700 million to $500 million (see further details regarding these matters below). On November 14, 2006, the Company entered into a new $750 million five year multi currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility) with a syndicate of lenders. The Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the UK Credit Facility and the Canadian Credit Facility (all of which are defined below). Interest on borrowings denominated in U.S. Dollars under the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility will accrue at specified rates based on the Companys debt rating, initially at 50 basis points over LIBOR or the prime rate. Interest on borrowings for any Euro loan accrues at EURIBOR plus a specified rate and for any Sterling loan at LIBOR plus a specified rate. The specified rates are based on the Companys debt ratings and range from 19 basis points to 60 basis points over LIBOR or EURIBOR, as applicable. Interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars accrues at the greater of the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. The Company will pay quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specific rates based on the Companys debt rating (ranging from 6 basis points to 15 basis points of the total commitment). This rate was 12.5 basis points as of November 14, 2006. In connection with entering into the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility, the Company incurred approximately $1.0 million of costs, which were deferred and will be amortized over the life of the facility. The Company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The covenants under the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility are less restrictive than those under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility, thereby providing the Company with greater financial flexibility. The Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that require compliance with financial tests, including leverage and minimum earnings to fixed charges ratios. 41 Table of Contents The $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in April 2006, was amended and now expires in April 2007. The $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility is included in the Within 1 year column in the repayment table on page 44. However, the borrowing is not classified in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2006 because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. In March 2006, the Company entered into a &pound;20 million multicurrency revolving credit facility (the UK Credit Facility) due March 2009 with a financial institution in connection with the Companys acquisition of Brecon. The Company utilized amounts available to it under the new Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility to repay its outstanding balance under the UK Credit Facility and terminated this facility in November 2006. In October 2005, the Company entered into a C$135 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Canadian Credit Facility) due December 2009 with a syndicate of lenders in connection with the Companys acquisition of Trent. The Company utilized amounts available to it under the new Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility to repay its outstanding balance under the Canadian Credit Facility and terminated this facility in November 2006. In an effort to reduce its interest expense, extend maturities of its long term debt and ease its debt covenant restrictions, the Company refinanced its long term debt in September 2005. The Company issued $400 million of 5 5/8% senior notes due September 15, 2012 (the 2012 Notes) and $500 million of 5 7/8% senior notes due September 15, 2015 (the 2015 Notes). The 2012 Notes and 2015 Notes each were sold at 99.5% of principal amount and have an effective yield of 5.71% and 5.94%, respectively. Interest on the 2012 Notes and the 2015 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears, which commenced on March 15, 2006. Both the 2012 Notes and the 2015 Notes are redeemable at the Companys option at a price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount thereof, or the sum of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined. In addition, at any time before September 15, 2008, the Company may redeem up to an aggregate of 35% of the principal amount of the 2012 Notes or the 2015 Notes at redemption prices equal to 105.625% and 105.875%, respectively, of the principal amounts thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of redemption, with the cash proceeds of one or more equity issuances. The gross proceeds from the sale of the 2012 Notes and the 2015 Notes were used to finance the early retirement of the $500 million of 8 1/8% senior notes due 2008 (the 8 1/8% Notes) and $300 million of 7 1/4% senior notes due 2012 (the 7 1/4% Notes) in September 2005, including the payment of $102.3 million of premiums and other costs. Additionally, the Company expensed $8.5 million of deferred financing costs related to the retirement of the 7 1/4% Notes and the 8 1/8% Notes. In November 2005, Standard & Poors Ratings Services announced that it raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings on the Company to BBB from BB+. As a result of the upgrade, a substantial number of covenants under the indenture governing its 5 5/8% senior notes due 2012 and 5 7/8% senior notes due 2015 were eliminated. On June 1, 2006, Moodys Investors Service raised the Companys corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to Ba1 from Ba2. On July 21, 2006, Fitch Ratings raised the Companys corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to BBB from BBB . In July 2003, the Company entered into a $1.05 billion receivables securitization facility (Receivables Securitization Facility). In connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, ABDC sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, a wholly owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. ABDC is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. After the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. In December 2004, the Company amended its Receivables Securitization Facility and under the terms of the amendment, the $550 million (three year tranche) originally scheduled to expire in July 2006 was increased 42 Table of Contents to $700 million and the expiration date was extended to November 2007. Additionally, the $500 million (364 day tranche) scheduled to expire in July 2005 was reduced to $350 million and was set to expire in December 2005. In October 2005, the Company terminated the 364 day tranche. On November 14, 2006, the Company further amended the facility such that the amount to be made available under the three year tranche was reduced from $700 million to $500 million and the expiration date was extended to November 2009. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper plus a program fee, which varies based on the Companys debt ratings. The program fee was 55 basis points as of September 30, 2006 and was reduced to 35 basis points as a result of the November 2006 amendment. Additionally, the commitment fee on any unused credit was 17.5 basis points as of September 30, 2006 and was reduced to 12.5 basis points as a result of the November 2006 amendment. At September 30, 2006, there were no borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The facility is a financing vehicle utilized by the Company because it offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. The Company securitizes its trade accounts, which were generally non interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings under SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. The agreement governing the Receivables Securitization Facility contains restrictions and covenants which include limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, making of certain restricted payments, issuance of preferred stock, creation of certain liens, and certain corporate acts such as mergers, consolidations and sale of substantially all assets. In December 2004, the Company entered into a $700 million five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Senior Revolving Credit Facility) with a syndicate of lenders. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2006. In November 2006, in connection with entering into the new Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility, as defined above, the Company terminated the Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The Senior Revolving Credit Facility contained covenants that imposed limitations on, among other things, additional indebtedness, distributions and dividends to stockholders, and investments. Additional covenants required compliance with financial tests, including leverage and minimum earnings to fixed charges ratios. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company paid $100 million to redeem the Bergen 7 1/4% Senior Notes due June 1, 2005, upon their maturity. The Companys operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under its debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt and repurchases of shares of the Companys common stock. Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was $807 million, down as expected from the $1.53 billion in fiscal 2005, where the majority of the benefits to working capital from the business model transition to fee for service were realized. As the transition is now complete, net cash provided by operating activities is expected to decline to a range of $525 million to $625 million in fiscal 2007. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the payment of interest on debt, finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. Significant cash flows from operations primarily resulting from the business model transition, as discussed previously, have resulted in a debt to total capital ratio of 20.9% and a net debt to total capital ratio of less than zero. The Company has been and continues to actively evaluate its alternatives to deploy its excess capital. For example, in fiscal 2006, the Company spent nearly $300 million on strategic acquisitions (see further details on page 46) and used $717.7 million to acquire its common stock. Additionally, in August 2006, the Company announced plans to repurchase an additional $750 million of its common stock, of which the Company anticipates spending $450 million to $500 million in fiscal 2007. The Company continues to expect to pursue strategic acquisitions. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund the Companys ongoing cash requirements. 43 Table of Contents Following is a summary of the Companys contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on its debt, minimum rental payments on its noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on its other commitments at September 30, 2006 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Within 1year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Debt, including interest payments $ 1,505,419 $ 111,799 $ 136,300 $ 217,320 $ 1,040,000 Operating leases 300,851 70,072 106,564 61,370 62,845 Other commitments 1,259,951 140,924 361,682 235,207 522,138 Total $ 3,066,221 $ 322,795 $ 604,546 $ 513,897 $ 1,624,983 The $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility, which expires in April 2007, is included in the Within 1 year column in the above repayment table. However, this borrowing is not classified in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2006 because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. In fiscal 2006, the Company entered into agreements to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers. The Company is required to purchase annual doses at prices that the Company believes will represent market prices. The Company currently estimates its remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately $169 million as of September 30, 2006. These influenza vaccine commitments are included in Other commitments in the above table. In December 2004, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with an influenza vaccine manufacturer to distribute product through March 31, 2015. The agreement includes a commitment to purchase at least 12 million doses per year of the influenza vaccine provided the vaccine is approved and available for distribution in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Company will be required to purchase the annual doses at market prices, as adjusted for inflation and other factors. The manufacturer received FDA approval for the 2006/2007 influenza season in October 2006. The Company anticipates its purchase commitment for fiscal 2007 will be approximately $56 million. The Company anticipates its total purchase commitment will be approximately $0.9 billion. This influenza vaccine commitment is included in Other commitments in the above table. In fiscal 2005, the Company outsourced a significant portion of its corporate and ABDC information technology activities and entered into a ten year commitment, effective July 1, 2005, with IBM Global Services, which has assumed responsibility for performing the outsourced information technology activities. The minimum commitment under the outsourcing arrangement was approximately $200 million over a ten year period. The Company has included the remaining minimum commitment of $162.2 million in Other commitments in the above table. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the Companys operating activities provided $807.3 million of cash as compared to cash provided of $1,526.6 million in the prior year. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was principally the result of net income of $467.7 million, non cash items of $221.4 million (of which $92.1 million represented deferred income taxes), and a $1,156.1 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes, partially offset by a $680.0 million increase in accounts receivable and a $349.5 million increase in merchandise inventories. The increase in accounts payable is primarily a result of our 13% operating revenue increase and the timing of payments to our suppliers. The increase in inventory was due to the increase in operating revenue, net of the increase in the inventory turnover rate. The inventory turnover rate for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment improved to 12.2 times in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 from 10.2 times in the prior fiscal year. The improvement was derived from lower average inventory levels due to an increase in the number of fee for service agreements, inventory management and other vendor agreements, and a reduction in the number of distribution facilities. The 44 Table of Contents increase in accounts receivable was due to the increase in operating revenue and an increase in average days sales outstanding. Average days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment increased to 16.7 days for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 from 15.4 days in the prior fiscal year. This increase was largely driven by the above market rate growth of the Specialty Group, which generally has a higher receivable investment than the ABDC business. Average days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment were 45.4 days for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 compared to 40.2 days in the prior fiscal year. The increase in PharMericas average days sales outstanding was primarily due to the slower reimbursement under Medicare Part D in comparison to the prior years reimbursement under Medicaid. Deferred income taxes of $92.1 million in fiscal 2006 were significantly higher than the $17.0 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the increase in income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 included $62.3 million in interest payments and $107.5 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Companys operating activities provided $1.53 billion of cash as compared to cash provided of $825.1 million in the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was principally the result of a $1.1 billion decrease in merchandise inventories, a $311.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes, non cash items of $282.3 million, and net income of $264.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $392.8 million. The inventory turnover rate for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment improved to 10.2 times in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 from 8.2 times in the prior fiscal year. The improvement was derived from lower average inventory levels due to an increase in the number of fee for service agreements, inventory management and other vendor agreements, a reduction in buy side profit opportunities, and a reduction in the number of distribution facilities. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily due to an increase in sales volume, the timing of purchases of merchandise inventories and cash payments to our vendors. The increase in accounts receivable was largely driven by the continued strong revenue growth of ABSG, which has a significantly higher average days sales outstanding than ABDC and the timing of cash receipts from our customers. Average days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment were 40.2 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 compared to 38.4 days in the prior year period. Non cash items of $282.3 million included a $111.9 million loss on early retirement of debt and $90.9 million of depreciation and amortization. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 included $94.2 million in interest payments and $132.6 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Companys operating activities provided $825.1 million of cash. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2004 was principally the result of a decrease in merchandise inventories of $916.3 million, net income of $468.4 million and non cash items of $151.5 million, offset in part, by a $432.0 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes. The Companys change in accounting for customer sales returns had the effect of increasing merchandise inventories and reducing accounts receivable by $316.8 million at September 30, 2004. Merchandise inventories have continued to decline due to an increase in the number of inventory management agreements, a reduction in buy side profit opportunities, and a reduction in the number of distribution facilities. The turnover of merchandise inventories for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment improved to 8.2 times in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 from 6.7 times in the prior fiscal year. The $446.7 million decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the decline of merchandise inventories. Average days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment increased slightly to 17.1 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 from 16.9 days in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the strong revenue growth of ABSG, which has a significantly higher average days sales outstanding than ABDC. Average days sales outstanding for the PharMerica segment improved to 38.4 days in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 from 39.3 days in the prior fiscal year as a result of the continued emphasis on receivables management. Non cash items of $151.5 million included $87.1 million of depreciation and amortization and $48.9 million of deferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes of $48.9 million in fiscal 2004 were significantly lower than the $127.2 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to the decline in income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories. Operating cash uses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 included $111.0 million in interest payments and $200.1 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. 45 Table of Contents Capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $113.1 million, $203.4 million and $189.3 million, respectively, and related principally to the construction of the six new distribution facilities in ABDC, investments in warehouse expansions and improvements, information technology and warehouse automation. Capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 were significantly lower than capital expenditures during the prior two fiscal years because the Company incurred the majority of its construction costs related to its six new distribution facilities in ABDC in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004. The Company estimates that it will spend approximately $100 million to $125 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2007. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the Company established operations in Canada by acquiring three distributors. In October 2005, the Company acquired Trent for a purchase price of $81.1 million. In March 2006, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Asenda for a purchase price of $18.2 million. The third Canadian distributor, Rep Pharm, Inc., was acquired in September 2006 for a purchase price of $47.5 million. The Company also acquired Brecon, a United Kingdom based company, for $50.2 million. The Brecon purchase price is subject to a contingent payment of up to $19 million if Brecon achieves certain earnings targets in calendar 2006. The Company currently anticipates it will settle this contingency prior to the end of the contingency period with the former owners of Brecon for an amount less than the maximum contingent amount. In the U.S., the Company acquired NMCR in February 2006 for a purchase price of $86.6 million and acquired certain assets of a technology solution company for our Long Term Care business for $12.6 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2006, the Company acquired Health Advocates, Inc. (renamed PMSI MSA Services, Inc.) for approximately $83 million, IgG for approximately $35 million, and AMD for approximately $12.9 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company paid $39.0 million for the remaining 40% equity interest in International Physician Networks that it did not previously own. Additionally, the Company paid approximately $13.7 million in cash for MedSelect, Inc., a provider of automated medication and supply dispensing cabinets, and $16.6 million in cash for Imedex, Inc., an accredited provider of continuing medical education for physicians. Net cash used in investing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 included purchases of short term investment securities of $2.0 billion and proceeds from the sale of short term investment securities of $2.3 billion. These short term investment securities primarily consisted of commercial paper and tax exempt variable rate demand notes used to maximize the Companys after tax interest income. Net cash used in investing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 also included proceeds of $49.6 million from the sale of property and equipment (of which $38.0 million related to the sale of the former Bergen Brunswig headquarters in Orange, California), proceeds of $28.1 million from two sale leaseback transactions entered into by the Company with financial institutions relating to equipment previously acquired for our new distribution facilities, and $7.6 million of proceeds from the sale of an equity investment and an eminent domain settlement.

The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Companys board of directors and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Market Risk The Companys most significant market risk is the effect of fluctuations in interest rates. The Company manages interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. The Company also has market risk exposure relating to its cash and cash equivalents and its short term investment securities available for sale. At September 30, 2006, the Company had $196.6 million of variable rate debt. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the Companys working capital requirements. The Company periodically evaluates various financial instruments that could mitigate a portion of its exposure to variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. There were no such financial instruments in effect at September 30, 2006. The Company had $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2006. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and short term investment securities available for sale would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable rate debt, a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the Companys annual net interest expense by $0.5 million. The multinational operations of the Company are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk. The Company utilizes foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. Such contracts generally have durations of less than one year. During fiscal 2006, the Companys largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the Canadian Dollar. At September 30, 2006, the Company had three foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding for a total notional amount of $65.2 million. The Company is using these contracts to hedge against changes in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. A 10% change of the Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar would cause a $7.1 million change to the fair value of the Companys foreign currency denominated forward contracts held at September 30, 2006. The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposures and not for speculative or trading purposes. Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which requires companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments at fair value for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, using the modified prospective transition method, beginning on October 1, 2005 and, therefore, began to expense the fair value of all outstanding options over their remaining vesting periods to the extent the options were not fully vested as of the adoption date and began to expense the fair value of all share based compensation awards granted subsequent to September 30, 2005 over their requisite service periods. Previous periods were not retrospectively adjusted. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow ($21.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006); rather than an operating cash flow as previously required. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, the Company classified share based compensation within distribution, selling and administrative expenses to correspond with the same line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further details). In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position 48 Table of Contents taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this interpretation. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit and Other Postretirement Plans, which generally requires an employer to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. This statement also generally requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. SFAS No. 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The Company does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact to its financial position.
