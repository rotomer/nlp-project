ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein. The Company is a pharmaceutical services company providing drug distribution and related healthcare services and solutions to its pharmacy, physician, and manufacturer customers, which currently are based primarily in the United States and Canada. The Company also provides pharmaceuticals to workers compensation patients and related services to insurance payors. The Company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers. Substantially all of the Companys operations are located in the United States and Canada. The Company also has packaging operations located in the United Kingdom. On July 31, 2007, the Company and Kindred HealthCare, Inc. (Kindred) completed the spin offs and subsequent combination of their institutional pharmacy businesses, PharMerica Long Term Care (Long Term Care) and Kindred Pharmacy Services (KPS), to form a new, independent, publicly traded company named PharMerica Corporation (PMC). (See Divestiture section below). As part of this transaction, the Company entered into a pharmaceutical distribution agreement with PMC, under which it continues to distribute pharmaceuticals to and generate cash flows from the disposed institutional pharmacy business. The historical operating results of Long Term Care are not reported as a discontinued operation of the Company because of the significance of the expected continuing cash flows resulting from the pharmaceutical distribution agreement entered into between PMC and the Company. Accordingly, for periods prior to August 1, 2007, the historical operating results of Long Term Care will continue to be included in the historical continuing operations of the Company. In this Form 10 K, the Company has renamed as Other the reportable segment referred to previously as the PharMerica segment. The Other segment includes the operating results of Long Term Care through the July 31, 2007 spin off date and the Companys workers compensation related business (PMSI). Acquisitions In October 2006, the Company acquired Health Advocates, Inc. (Health Advocates), a leading provider of Medicare set aside cost containment services to insurance payors primarily within the workers compensation industry, for $83.8 million. Health Advocates was renamed PMSI MSA Services, Inc. (PMSI MSA Services) and operates under PMSI. The addition of PMSI MSA Services, combined with our leading pharmacy and clinical solutions, gives the Companys workers compensation business the ability to provide its customers with a fully integrated Medicare set aside solution. In October 2006, the Company acquired I.G.G. of America, Inc. (IgG), a specialty pharmacy and infusion services business specializing in the blood derivative intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), for $37.2 million. The addition of IgG supports the Companys strategy of building its specialty pharmaceutical services to manufacturers. In November 2006, the Company acquired Access M.D., Inc. (AMD), a Canadian company, for $13.4 million. AMD provides services, including reimbursement support, third party logistics and nursing support services to manufacturers of specialty pharmaceuticals, such as injectable and biological therapies. The acquisition of AMD expands our specialty services businesses into Canada and complements the distribution services offered by AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation. In April 2007, the Company acquired Xcenda LLC (Xcenda) for a purchase price of $25.2 million. Xcenda will enhance AmerisourceBergens consulting business within its existing pharmaceutical and specialty services businesses and provide additional capabilities within pharmaceutical brand services, applied health outcomes and biopharma strategies. 26 Table of Contents On October 1, 2007, the Company acquired Bellco Health (Bellco), a privately held New York distributor of branded and generic pharmaceuticals, for a purchase price of approximately $181 million in cash. Bellco is a pharmaceutical distributor in the Metro New York City area, where it primarily services independent retail community pharmacies. The acquisition of Bellco expands the Companys presence in this large community pharmacy market. Nationally, Bellco markets and sells generic pharmaceuticals to individual retail pharmacies, and provides pharmaceutical products and services to dialysis clinics. Bellcos revenues were $2.1 billion for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Divestiture As previously noted, on July 31, 2007, the Company and Kindred completed the spin offs and subsequent combination of their institutional pharmacy businesses, Long Term Care and KPS, to form PMC. In connection with this transaction, Long Term Care borrowed $125 million from a financial institution and provided a one time distribution back to the Company. The cash distribution by Long Term Care to the Company was tax free. The institutional pharmacy businesses were then spun off to the stockholders of their respective parent companies, followed immediately by the merger of the two institutional pharmacy businesses into subsidiaries of PMC, which resulted in the Companys and Kindreds stockholders each owning approximately 50 percent of PMC immediately after the closing of the transaction. The Companys stockholders received 0.0833752 shares of PMC common stock for each share of AmerisourceBergen common stock owned. Additionally, the Company entered into a pharmaceutical distribution agreement with PMC and the Company also entered into an agreement with PMC for the provision of certain transition services for a limited transition period following consummation of the transaction. The Company spun off $196.6 million of net assets of Long Term Care to PMC as a result of this transaction and recorded a corresponding reduction to its retained earnings. Reportable Segments The Companys operations are comprised of two reportable segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and Other. The Other reportable segment includes the operating results of Long Term Care, through the July 31, 2007 spin off date, and PMSI. Pharmaceutical Distribution The Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment is comprised of three operating segments, which include the operations of AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC), the AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG) and the AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group (ABPG). Servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. ABDC distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals, over the counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, alternate site facilities and other customers. ABDC also provides pharmacy management, consulting services and scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment, medication and supply dispensing cabinets, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. ABSG, through a number of individual operating businesses, provides distribution and other services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers. ABSG also distributes vaccines, other injectables, plasma, and other blood products. In addition, 27 Table of Contents through its specialty services businesses, ABSG provides a number of commercialization services, third party logistics, group purchasing, and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as reimbursement consulting, data analytics, practice management, and physician education. ABPG consists of American Health Packaging, Anderson Packaging (Anderson), and Brecon Pharmaceuticals Limited (Brecon). American Health Packaging delivers unit dose, punch card, unit of use, compliance and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. American Health Packagings largest customer is ABDC, and, as a result, its operations are closely aligned with the operations of ABDC. Anderson is a leading provider of contracted packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Brecon is a United Kingdom based provider of contract packaging and clinical trials materials (CTM) services for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Other Prior to its divestiture, Long Term Care was a leading national dispenser of pharmaceutical products and services to patients in long term care and alternate site settings, including skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and residential living communities. Long Term Cares institutional pharmacy business involved the purchase of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals, principally from our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, and the dispensing of those products to residents in long term care and alternate site facilities. PMSI provides mail order and on line pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers compensation programs, and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors. PMSI services include home delivery of prescription drugs, medical supplies and equipment and an array of computer software solutions to reduce the payors administrative costs. The recent addition of PMSI MSA Services gives the PMSI business the ability to provide its customers with a fully integrated Medicare set aside solution. 28 Table of Contents AmerisourceBergen Corporation Summary Segment Information Operating Revenue Fiscal year ended September 30, 2007vs.2006Change 2006 vs. 2005Change 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in thousands) Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 60,935,344 $ 55,907,552 $ 49,319,371 9 % 13 % Other Long Term Care(a) 1,045,662 1,211,548 1,131,447 (14 ) 7 PMSI 461,370 456,760 439,922 1 4 Total Other 1,507,032 1,668,308 1,571,369 (10 ) 6 Intersegment eliminations (773,344 ) (902,920 ) (878,142 ) (14 ) (3 ) Total $ 61,669,032 $ 56,672,940 $ 50,012,598 9 % 13 % Operating Income Fiscal year ended September 30, 2007vs.2006Change 2006 vs. 2005Change 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in thousands) Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 733,388 $ 644,202 $ 532,887 14 % 21 % Other Long Term Care(a) 24,996 32,325 34,471 (23 ) (6 ) PMSI 28,193 51,420 57,476 (45 ) (11 ) Total Other 53,189 83,745 91,947 (36 ) (9 ) Facility consolidations, employee severance and other (2,072 ) (20,123 ) (22,723 ) (90 ) (11 ) Gain on antitrust litigation settlements 35,837 40,882 40,094 (12 ) 2 Impairment charge (5,259 ) n/m n/m Total $ 820,342 $ 748,706 $ 636,946 10 % 18 % Percentages of operating revenue: Pharmaceutical Distribution Gross profit 3.08 % 3.08 % 3.03 % Operating expenses 1.88 % 1.93 % 1.95 % Operating income 1.20 % 1.15 % 1.08 % Other Long Term Care Gross profit 29.37 % 29.47 % 29.24 % Operating expenses 26.98 % 26.81 % 26.19 % Operating income 2.39 % 2.67 % 3.05 % PMSI Gross profit 23.34 % 24.13 % 26.22 % Operating expenses 17.23 % 12.87 % 13.16 % Operating income 6.11 % 11.26 % 13.07 % Total Other Gross profit 27.53 % 28.01 % 28.40 % Operating expenses 24.00 % 22.99 % 22.54 % Operating income 3.53 % 5.02 % 5.85 % AmerisourceBergen Corporation Gross profit 3.77 % 3.94 % 3.96 % Operating expenses 2.44 % 2.62 % 2.69 % Operating income 1.33 % 1.32 % 1.27 % (a) The fiscal 2007 operating revenue and operating income of Long Term Care represent its results for the ten month period ended July 31, 2007, the date of its divestiture. 29 Table of Contents Year ended September 30, 2007 compared with Year ended September 30, 2006 Consolidated Results Operating revenue of $61.7 billion in fiscal 2007, which excludes bulk deliveries, increased 9% from the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to increases in operating revenue in our ABDC and ABSG operating segments, both of which are included in the Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment. Our acquisitions contributed 1% of the operating revenue growth in fiscal 2007. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. Bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the Company at the express direction of the customer, and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers warehouse sites (i.e., drop shipment) or shipments from the supplier to the Company for immediate shipment to the customers warehouse sites (i.e., cross dock shipment). Bulk deliveries of $4.4 billion in fiscal 2007 decreased 3% from the prior fiscal year. Revenue relating to bulk deliveries fluctuates primarily due to changes in demand from the Companys largest bulk customer. The Company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has the ultimate responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the products purchased, and bears full risk of delivery and loss for products, whether the products are drop shipped or shipped cross dock. The Company also bears full credit risk associated with the creditworthiness of any bulk delivery customer. As a result, and in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, the Company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues. Due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries, fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins. However, revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the Companys cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the Company and payments by the Company to its suppliers. Gross profit of $2.3 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 4% from the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue, an increase in compensation under its fee for service agreements and the growth of its generic programs, offset in part by a $27.8 million charge incurred by ABSG relating to tetanus diphtheria vaccine inventory and the decline in gross profit of the Other segment. During fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized gains of $35.8 million and $40.9 million, respectively, from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. These gains, which are net of attorney fees and estimated payments due to other parties, were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and contributed 2% of gross profit in fiscal 2007 and 2006. The Company is unable to estimate future gains, if any, it will recognize as a result of antitrust litigation (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in fiscal 2007 decreased 17 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the decline in gross profit of the Other segment. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization (DSAD&A) of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 3% from the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily related to our operating revenue growth, operating expenses of our recently acquired companies, an increase in bad debt expense of $14.7 million and an increase in share based compensation of $8.6 million, all of which was partially offset by a decline in DSAD&A of the Other segment, and a decline in employee incentive compensation. As a percentage of operating revenue, DSAD&A in fiscal 2007 decreased 14 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decline in DSAD&A of the Other segment resulting from the divestiture of the Long Term Care business. In 2001, the Company developed an integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions. The plan, which is complete, included building six new facilities, closing 31 facilities and outsourcing a significant portion of its information technology activities. To complete the plan, we closed two distribution facilities in fiscal 2007 and now have 26 distribution facilities in the U.S. as of September 30, 2007. The Company closed six distribution facilities in each of fiscal 2006 and 2005. During fiscal 2006, the Company opened the last of its new distribution facilities and completed the outsourcing of a significant portion of its information technology activities. 30 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the charges incurred by the Company relating to facility consolidations, employee severance and other for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands): 2007 2006 Facility consolidations and employee severance $ (5,863 ) $ 4,271 Information technology transition costs 1,679 9,218 Costs relating to the Long Term Care transaction 9,335 6,634 Gain on sale of retail pharmacy assets (3,079 ) Total facility consolidations, employee severance and other $ 2,072 $ 20,123 In fiscal 2006, the Company incurred a charge of $13.9 million for an increase in a compensation accrual due to an adverse decision in an employment related dispute with a former Bergen Brunswig chief executive officer whose employment was terminated in 1999. In October 2007, the Company received a favorable ruling from a California appellate court reversing certain portions of the prior adverse decision. As a result, the Company reduced its liability in fiscal 2007 to the Bergen Brunswig chief executive officer by $10.4 million (see Bergen Brunswig Matter under Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements). The fiscal 2006 compensation expense and the fiscal 2007 reduction thereof have been recorded as a component of the facility consolidations and employee severance line in the above table. In fiscal 2007, the Company sold certain retail pharmacy assets of its Long Term Care business prior to the Long Term Care divestiture, and as a result, recognized a gain of $3.1 million. In fiscal 2006, the Company realized a $17.3 million gain from the sale of the former Bergen Brunswig headquarters building in Orange, California. This gain was recorded as a component of the facility consolidations and employee severance line in the above table. All employee terminations have been completed relating to the aforementioned integration plan. The Company paid a total of $20.7 million and $20.6 million for employee severance, lease cancellation and other costs during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to the integration plan. Remaining unpaid amounts of $15.9 million for employee severance, lease cancellation and other costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2007. Most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time, generally not in excess of 12 months, while others may receive a lump sum payment. Operating income of $820.3 million in fiscal 2007 increased 10% from the prior fiscal year due to the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, offset in part, by the Other segment. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in fiscal 2007 increased 1 basis point from the prior fiscal year due to the 5 basis point improvement in Pharmaceutical Distributions operating income margin that was largely offset by the decline in the Other segments operating income margin. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other contributed $33.8 million to operating income in fiscal 2007 and contributed 5 basis points to operating income as a percentage of operating revenue. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other contributed $20.8 million to operating income in fiscal 2006 and contributed 4 basis points to operating income as a percentage of operating revenue. Other loss of $3.0 million in fiscal 2007 primarily related to other than temporary impairment losses incurred with respect to equity investments. Other income of $4.4 million in fiscal 2006 primarily included a $3.4 million gain resulting from an eminent domain settlement and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of an equity investment, offset in part, by losses incurred relating to an equity investment. 31 Table of Contents Interest expense and interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2007 and 2006 were as follows (in thousands): 2007 2006 Amount Weighted AverageInterest Rate Amount Weighted AverageInterest Rate Interest expense $ 75,706 5.65 % $ 65,874 5.64 % Interest income (43,418 ) 4.26 % (53,410 ) 4.03 % Interest expense, net $ 32,288 $ 12,464 Interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase of $114.3 million in average borrowings primarily related to the Companys Canadian operations. Interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decline in average invested cash and short term investments of $313.6 million from the prior fiscal year. The decrease in invested cash and short term investments from the prior fiscal year was primarily related to the Companys $1.4 billion of purchases of its common stock in fiscal 2007, offset largely by $1.2 billion of net cash provided by operating activities. The Companys net interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in interest rates and strategic decisions made by the Company to deploy its invested cash and short term investments. Income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate of 37.1%, versus 36.8% in the prior fiscal year. The tax rate for fiscal 2007 was greater than the tax rate for the prior fiscal year, which benefitted from more favorable tax adjustments than the current fiscal year and a larger portion of the Companys invested cash in tax free investments. The Company expects to have an effective income tax rate between 37% and 38% in future periods, which will primarily depend on its mix of tax free and taxable investments, including cash and cash equivalents. Income from continuing operations of $493.8 million in fiscal 2007 increased 6% from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by the increase in interest expense. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.63 in fiscal 2007 increased 16% from $2.26 per share in the prior fiscal year. The divested Long Term Care business contributed $0.08 and $0.10 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other contributed $17.0 million to income from continuing operations and $0.09 to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements, the eminent domain settlement, the sale of an equity investment and the favorable tax adjustments, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other contributed $23.2 million to income from continuing operations and $0.11 to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006. Loss from discontinued operations of $24.6 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2007 relates to an adverse court ruling received by the Company with respect to a contingent purchase price adjustment in connection with the 2003 acquisition of Bridge Medical, Inc. (Bridge), as previously discussed in Legal Proceedings under Item 3. Substantially all of the assets of the Bridge business were sold in July 2005. Net income of $469.2 million in fiscal 2007 was flat compared to the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share of $2.50 in fiscal 2007 increased 11% from $2.25 per share in the prior fiscal year. The increase in diluted earnings per share was due to the 9% reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the Companys purchases of its common stock in connection with its stock buyback programs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources), net of the impact of stock option exercises. 32 Table of Contents Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue of $60.9 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 9% from the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by the strong, above market, 23% operating revenue growth of ABSG, principally in its distribution businesses. ABDC grew its operating revenue by 6% in comparison to the prior fiscal year. During fiscal 2007, 62% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 38% was from sales to retail customers; this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 58% institutional and 42% retail. In comparison with the prior year results, sales to institutional customers increased 14% primarily due to the strong growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business. Sales to retail customers increased 2% as growth in retail chain sales was offset, in part, by our decision to discontinue servicing the large lower margin customer discussed below. The ABDC operating revenue growth rate in fiscal 2007 benefited from increased sales to certain of its large customers and the 1% revenue contribution resulting from the full year impact of its 2006 Canadian acquisitions. ABDCs operating revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by the Companys decision not to renew a contract, effective January 2007, with a large, low margin customer that contributed approximately $1.0 billion of operating revenue for ABDC in fiscal 2006 and the July 2006 loss of two customer accounts that totaled $1.2 billion of revenue in fiscal 2006. These customer accounts transitioned to another distributor after they were acquired by a company supplied by that distributor. ABSG grew at a rate in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth. ABSGs operating revenue of $12.2 billion in fiscal 2007 grew 23% from the prior fiscal year. The majority of this groups revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology. ABSGs oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be ABSGs most significant contributor to revenue growth. During fiscal 2007, the oncology business benefited from a semi exclusive distribution agreement that it signed with a large biotechnology manufacturer during the second half of fiscal 2006 and ABSGs Besse Medical business experienced strong growth in fiscal 2007 primarily arising from the distribution of a new physician administered ophthalmology product, which was introduced in the second half of fiscal 2006. ABSG also distributes vaccines, plasma and other blood products. ABSGs business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, including oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs. Since ABSG provides a number of services to or through physicians, any changes to this service channel could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues. Approximately 6% of the Companys operating revenue in fiscal 2007 related to the distribution of anemia related products, which are distributed by both ABDC and ABSG. Several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs during the second half of fiscal 2007, including the decision in March 2007 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require an expanded warning label on these drugs, CMSs review of reimbursement policies for these drugs and restrictions on recommended dosage or use. In July 2007, CMS issued new, more restrictive policies regarding Medicare coverage of anemia drugs used in the treatment of oncology patients and for kidney failure and dialysis. On November 8, 2007, the FDA announced revised boxed warnings and other safety related product labeling changes for these drugs addressing the risks posed to patients with cancer or chronic kidney failure. CMS also has indicated that it may impose additional restrictions on Medicare coverage in the future. Further changes in medical guidelines for anemia drugs may impact the availability and extent of reimbursement for these drugs from third party payers, including federal and state governments and private insurance plans. The Companys future operating revenue growth rate and or profitability may continue to be impacted by any future reductions in reimbursement for anemia drugs or changes that limit the dosage and or use of anemia drugs. (See Part I, Item 1A. (Risk Factors) on page 13). The Company currently expects that its operating revenue growth in fiscal 2008 will range from 5% to 7%, including a 3% contribution from its acquisition of Bellco. ABDC revenues are expected to grow with the overall pharmaceutical market growth rate and ABSG revenues are expected to be flat to down 5% from fiscal 2007 33 Table of Contents primarily as a result of declining anemia drug sales and due to one of its customers for oncology drugs being acquired by a competitor in October 2007. The former customer contributed approximately $800 million to ABSGs operating revenue in fiscal 2007. ABDCs and ABSGs future operating revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors. These factors include competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on reimbursement rates, changes in Federal government rules and regulations, and industry growth trends, such as the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers. This segments growth largely reflects U.S. pharmaceutical industry conditions, including increases in prescription drug utilization, the introduction of new products, and higher pharmaceutical prices offset, in part, by the increased use of lower priced generics. The segments growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix. Industry sales in the United States, as estimated by industry data firm IMS Healthcare, Inc. (IMS), are expected to grow between 4% and 5% in 2008 and between 6% and 9% per year over the next five years. IMS also indicated that certain sectors of the market, such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals would grow faster than the overall market. Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit of $1,876.1 million in fiscal 2007 increased 9% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in operating revenue, an increase in compensation under our fee for service agreements, and the growth of our generic programs, offset in part by competitive pricing pressures and ABSGs $27.8 million charge relating to the write down of tetanus diphtheria vaccine inventory to its estimated net realizable value (see MBL Matter under Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements). As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in fiscal 2007 was flat compared to fiscal 2006. The Companys cost of goods sold includes a last in, first out (LIFO) provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. During fiscal 2007, inventory declines resulted in liquidation of LIFO layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior year. The effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2007 was to decrease cost of goods sold by $7.2 million. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating expenses of $1,142.7 million in fiscal 2007 increased 6% from the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily related to our operating revenue growth, operating expenses of our recently acquired companies, an increase in bad debt expense of $8.6 million primarily related to the recent bankruptcy of a retail chain customer in our West Region and an increase in share based compensation, and was partially offset by a decrease in employee incentive compensation. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in fiscal 2007 decreased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to economies of scale realized as a result of the increase in operating revenue, productivity gains achieved throughout the Companys distribution network as a result of our Optimiz&reg; program and a decrease in employee incentive compensation, and was partially offset by the increase in bad debt expense and the operating costs of our recently acquired companies. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income of $733.4 million in fiscal 2007 increased 14% from the prior fiscal year as the increase in gross profit exceeded the increase in operating expenses. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in fiscal 2007 increased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the improvement in the operating expense margin. Other As previously noted, the operating results of the Other segment in fiscal 2007 includes the operating results of Long Term Care only for the ten months ended July 31, 2007 due to the divestiture, and the operating results of PMSI for the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. Therefore, the fiscal 2007 results of operations of the Other segment is not comparable to fiscal 2006 results. 34 Table of Contents Long Term Care Long Term Cares operating revenue decreased 14% from the prior fiscal year due to the divestiture, effective July 31, 2007, as discussed above. Long Term Cares gross profit, operating expenses and operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2007 were relatively consistent with the prior fiscal year. PMSI PMSI operating revenue of $461.4 million in fiscal 2007 increased 1% from the prior fiscal year. This increase was the net result of the additional revenues of $19.0 million or 4% from the acquisition of PMSI MSA Services, which was partially offset by a 3% decline in PMSIs business due to competitive pressures. In particular, the loss of one customer in fiscal 2007 substantially contributed to the decline of PMSIs business. PMSIs operating revenue in fiscal 2008 is expected to be flat to down due to the loss of certain customers and will likely continue to be impacted significantly by competitive pressures. Operating revenue is also likely to be impacted in the future by the regulatory environment and the pharmaceutical inflation rate. PMSI gross profit of $107.7 million in fiscal 2007 decreased 2% from the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit was 23.34% in fiscal 2007 compared to 24.13% in the prior fiscal year. These declines were primarily due to the aforementioned customer loss and continuing industry competitive pressures surrounding pricing, which were partially offset by the additional $12.4 million gross profit contribution made by PMSI MSA Services. Future gross profit will likely be impacted by industry competitive pressures and continued downward pressure on rates of reimbursement for services provided. PMSI operating expenses of $79.5 million in fiscal 2007 increased 35% or $20.7 million from the prior fiscal year due to the additional $7.7 million of operating expenses of the PMSI MSA Services business, additional costs incurred relating to customer initiatives, investments in information technology infrastructure, and an increase in bad debt expense. Bad debt expense in fiscal 2007 increased by $3.7 million, with the prior fiscal year having benefitted from significant bad debt recoveries made as a result of improvements made in credit and cash application management procedures. Additionally, PMSI operating expenses in the prior fiscal year benefitted from a $3.2 million reduction in sales tax liabilities. PMSI operating income of $28.2 million in fiscal 2007 decreased 45% from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in its operating expenses and to a lesser extent, a decline in its gross profit. We expect the operating income of PMSI in fiscal 2008 to be flat to down when compared to fiscal 2007 due to customer losses and continuing costs relating to customer initiatives and investments in its information technology infrastructure. Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to the Other segment. ABDC is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to the Other segment. Year ended September 30, 2006 compared with Year ended September 30, 2005 Consolidated Results Operating revenue of $56.7 billion in fiscal 2006, which excludes bulk deliveries, increased 13% from the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The Company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products. Bulk deliveries of $4.5 billion in fiscal 2006 decreased 1% from the prior fiscal year. Revenue relating to bulk deliveries fluctuates primarily due to changes in demand from the Companys largest bulk customer. Due to the insignificant service fees generated 35 Table of Contents from bulk deliveries, fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins. However, revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the Companys cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the Company and payments by the Company to its suppliers. Gross profit of $2.2 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 13% from the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the increase in Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue, an increase in compensation under our fee for service agreements and growth of our generic programs. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in fiscal 2006 decreased by 2 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the strong growth in business with a few of our larger, lower margin customers. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized gains of $40.9 million and $40.1 million, respectively, from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, which represented 2% of gross profit. DSAD&A of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 11% from the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily related to growth in operating revenue, operating expenses of our acquired companies, investments to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures within ABDC, and share based compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment. As a percentage of operating revenue, DSAD&A in fiscal 2006 decreased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year. This decline was primarily due to productivity gains achieved throughout the Companys distribution network as a result of the Optimiz&reg; program, offset in part by investments made to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures within ABDC, expenses of our acquired companies, and share based compensation expense. In 2001, the Company developed an integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions. The plan included building six new facilities, closing 31 facilities, and outsourcing a significant portion of its information technology activities. During fiscal 2006, the Company opened the last of its new distribution facilities and completed the outsourcing of a significant portion of its information technology activities. During fiscal 2005, the Company announced plans to continue to consolidate and eliminate certain administrative functions, and to outsource a significant portion of the Companys information technology activities (the fiscal 2005 initiatives). During fiscal 2006, the Company closed six distribution facilities (the fiscal 2006 initiatives), incurred expenses relating to the planned spin off of PharMerica Long Term Care, realized a $17.3 million gain from the sale of the former Bergen Brunswig headquarters building in Orange, California, and incurred a charge of $13.9 million for an increase in a compensation accrual due to an adverse decision in an employment related dispute with a former Bergen Brunswig chief executive officer whose employment was terminated in 1999 (see Bergen Brunswig Matter under Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements). The following table illustrates the charges incurred by the Company relating to facility consolidations, employee severance and other for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands): 2006 2005 Facility consolidations and employee severance $ 4,271 $ 10,491 Information technology transition costs 9,218 12,232 Costs relating to the Long Term Care transaction 6,634 Total facility consolidations, employee severance and other $ 20,123 $ 22,723 The gain realized on the sale of the Bergen Brunswig headquarters and the compensation expense recognized in connection with the former Bergen Brunswig chief executive officer are components of the facility consolidations and employee severance line in the above table. 36 Table of Contents Through September 30, 2006, approximately 440 employees had been given termination notices as a result of the fiscal 2006 initiatives, of which approximately 400 had been terminated. As a result of the fiscal 2005 initiatives, approximately 450 employees were terminated. The Company paid a total of $20.6 million and $13.5 million for employee severance, lease cancellation and other costs during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to the aforementioned integration plan. Most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time, generally not in excess of 12 months, while others may receive a lump sum payment. In fiscal 2005, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.3 million relating to certain intangible assets held by ABDC. Operating income of $748.7 million in fiscal 2006 increased 18% from the prior fiscal year. The Companys operating income as a percentage of operating revenue in fiscal 2006 increased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in gross profit in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other contributed $20.8 million to operating income in fiscal 2006 and contributed 4 basis points to operating income as a percentage of operating revenue . The gain on antitrust litigation settlements, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other, and the impairment charge contributed $12.1 million to operating income in fiscal 2005 and contributed 2 basis points to operating income as a percentage of operating revenue. Other income of $4.4 million in fiscal 2006 primarily included a $3.4 million gain resulting from an eminent domain settlement and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of an equity investment, offset in part by losses incurred relating to another equity investment. Interest expense and interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2006 and 2005 were as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 Amount Weighted AverageInterest Rate Amount Weighted AverageInterest Rate Interest expense $ 65,874 5.64 % $ 76,394 7.14 % Interest income (53,410 ) 4.03 % (19,171 ) 2.23 % Interest expense, net $ 12,464 $ 57,233 Interest expense declined from the prior fiscal year due to a decline in weighted average interest rates resulting from the Companys fiscal 2005 long term debt refinancing. Interest income increased from the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of an increase in the Companys average cash and short term investments and an increase in market interest rates. The Companys average invested cash and short term investments during fiscal 2006 and 2005 was $1.3 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. The Company recorded a $111.9 million loss in fiscal 2005 related to the early retirement of debt. Income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate of 36.8%, versus 37.7% in the prior fiscal year. The decline in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by an increase in the amount of our tax free investments in comparison to our taxable investments, including cash and cash equivalents and certain other favorable tax adjustments. Income from continuing operations of $468.0 million in fiscal 2006 increased 60% from the prior fiscal year before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.26 in fiscal 2006 increased 65% from $1.37 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year before the cumulative 37 Table of Contents effect of the change in accounting. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements, the eminent domain settlement, the sale of an equity investment and the favorable tax adjustments, less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other contributed $23.2 million to income from continuing operations and $0.11 to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2006. The gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations, employee severance and other, the impairment charge and the loss on early retirement of debt decreased income from continuing operations by $64.2 million and decreased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.30 in fiscal 2005. In connection with the transition to a fee for service model, the Company changed its method of recognizing cash discounts and other related manufacturer incentives, effective October 1, 2004. The Company recorded a $10.2 million charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting (net of tax of $6.3 million) in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. This $10.2 million cumulative effect charge reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.05 in fiscal 2005. Loss from discontinued operations of $0.3 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2006, relates to certain adjustments made by the Company in connection with the December 2004 sale of the Companys Rita Ann cosmetics distribution business as well as the July 2005 sale of substantially all of the assets of Bridge Medical, Inc. (Bridge). Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, during fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 includes operating losses incurred in connection with the Rita Ann and Bridge businesses. The Company incurred a $6.5 million loss, net of tax, on the sale of the Rita Ann business, and a $4.6 million loss, net of tax, on the sale of the Bridge business, both of which are reflected in the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2005. Net income of $467.7 million in fiscal 2006 increased 77% from the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share of $2.25 in fiscal 2006 increased 81% from $1.24 per share in the prior fiscal year. The increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the reduced number of weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the Companys purchase of its common stock in connection with its stock buyback programs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources) offset in part by the increase in the number of stock option exercises. Segment Information Pharmaceutical Distribution Pharmaceutical Distribution operating revenue of $55.9 million in fiscal 2006 increased 13% from the prior fiscal year. The Companys acquisitions, primarily AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation (ABCC), contributed 1.5% of the operating revenue growth in fiscal 2006. Our operating revenue growth was higher than the market growth rate, and was driven by growth from a few of our larger institutional customers within ABDC, the continued strong growth of ABSG, principally in its distribution businesses, and new customers in all customer classes. During fiscal 2006, 58% of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 42% was from sales to retail customers; this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 57% institutional and 43% retail. In comparison with the prior year results, sales to institutional customers increased 16% primarily due to the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business and the growth of sales to a few of our larger alternate site institutional customers within ABDC. Sales to retail customers increased 10% over the prior fiscal year. The Companys acquisitions contributed 4% of the retail customer growth. This segments growth largely reflects U.S. pharmaceutical industry conditions, including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset, in part, by the increased use of lower priced generics. The segments growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix. As previously mentioned, our revenue growth in fiscal 2006 exceeded market growth primarily due to the growth of a few of our larger institutional customers within ABDC as well as the strong growth of ABSG. In July 2006, the Company discontinued servicing two customer accounts, which contributed $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion of the segments operating revenue in the fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. 38 Table of Contents The Companys Specialty Group has been growing at rates in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth. The Specialty Groups operating revenue grew 33% to $9.9 billion in fiscal 2006 from $7.4 billion in the prior fiscal year. The majority of this Groups revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, such as oncology. Additionally, the Specialty Group distributes vaccines, plasma and other blood products. The Specialty Groups oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the Specialty Groups most significant contributor to revenue growth. The Specialty Groups business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, including oncology drugs administered by physicians. Since the Specialty Group provides a number of services to or through physicians, this could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for the Specialty Group. Pharmaceutical Distribution gross profit of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 15% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in operating revenue, an increase in compensation under our fee for service agreements, and the growth of our generic programs. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in fiscal 2006 increased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year. The improvement was primarily due to an increase in compensation under our fee for service agreements, the growth of our generic programs, and contributions from our acquisitions. Customer mix, including the higher than average growth rate of a few of our larger, lower margin customers partially offset the aforementioned improvements. The Companys cost of goods sold includes a last in, first out (LIFO) provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. During fiscal 2005, inventory declines resulted in liquidation of LIFO layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior year. The effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2005 was to decrease cost of goods sold by $30.6 million. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating expenses of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 12% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily related to growth in operating revenue and the operating expenses of our acquired companies as well as share based compensation expense related to the fiscal 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 123R. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in fiscal 2006 decreased 2 basis points from the prior fiscal year, as productivity gains achieved throughout the Companys distribution network as a result of our Optimiz&reg; program were partially offset by our acquisitions, our investments made to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures, and share based compensation expense. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income of $644.2 million in fiscal 2006 increased 21% from the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in fiscal 2006 increased 7 basis points from the prior fiscal year. The increase over the prior year percentage was due to an increase in gross profit and reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, as compared to the prior fiscal year, as discussed above. Other Other segment operating revenue of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 6% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating revenue was primarily driven by the Long Term Care business. Long Term Care operating revenue of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 7% from the prior fiscal year as a result of an increase in the number of beds served, higher patient acuity, and drug price inflation. PMSI operating revenue of $456.8 million in fiscal 2006 increased 4% from the prior fiscal year. Other segment gross profit of $467.3 million in fiscal 2006 increased 5% from the prior fiscal year and was driven by an increase in Long Term Cares gross profit, offset by a decline in PMSI gross profit. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross profit in fiscal 2006 decreased 39 basis points from the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily driven by industry competitive pressures in both the Long Term Care and PMSI businesses and lower rates of reimbursement for services provided by the PMSI business. Long Term Care gross 39 Table of Contents profit of $357.1 million in fiscal 2006 increased 8% from the prior fiscal year and was primarily driven by the increase in operating revenue. PMSI gross profit of $110.2 million in fiscal 2006 decreased 4% from the prior fiscal year and was primarily driven by industry competitive pressures and lower rates of reimbursement from third party payors. Other segment operating expenses of $383.5 million in fiscal 2006 increased 8% from the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses in fiscal 2006 increased 45 basis points from the prior fiscal year. Long Term Care operating expenses of $324.7 million in fiscal 2006 increased 10% from the prior fiscal year. This increase was largely due to operating revenue growth, an increase in bad debt expense of $14.5 million, and additional costs related to the implementation of Medicare Part D under the MMA, which became effective on January 1, 2006. Long Term Cares bad debt expense increased over the prior year primarily due to billing and collection issues relating to the MMA transition and the negative impact that Texas Medicaid changes had on certain of its nursing home customers. PMSI operating expenses of $58.8 million in fiscal 2006 increased 2% from the prior fiscal year. This increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in operating revenue and was partially offset by a $4.3 million reduction in bad debt expense primarily due to improvements made in credit and cash application management and a $3.2 million reduction in sales and use tax liability due to favorable settlements. Other segment operating income of $83.7 million in fiscal 2006 decreased 9% from the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating income in fiscal 2006 decreased 83 basis points from the prior fiscal year. Long Term Care operating income of $32.3 million in fiscal 2006 decreased 6% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in its operating expenses. PMSI operating income of $51.4 million in fiscal 2006 decreased 11% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decrease in its gross profit. Intersegment Eliminations These amounts represent the elimination of the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments sales to the Other segment. ABDC is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to the Other segment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing the Companys financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For a complete list of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the Company for its pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, its customers financial strength and credit standing, and payment and default history. Changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in the Companys allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by Company management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables. Each of the Companys business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise. The Company writes off balances against the reserves when collectibility is deemed remote. Each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the 40 Table of Contents allowance at least quarterly and the Companys largest business units perform such reviews monthly. There were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. The bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts, net of write offs, recoveries and other adjustments. Schedule II of this Form 10 K sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $51.0 million, $36.3 million and $33.4 million, respectively. The increase in bad debt expense in fiscal 2007 was due to increases in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Other reporting segments of $8.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively. The recent bankruptcy of a regional chain customer in ABDCs West Region accounted for the majority of the bad debt increase within Pharmaceutical Distribution. PMSIs bad debt expense in fiscal 2007 increased by $3.7 million, with the prior fiscal year having benefitted from significant bad debt recoveries as a result of improvements made in credit and cash application management procedures. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2007 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately $3.9 million. Supplier Reserves The Company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due them from the Company. These reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of Company management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to the Company. The Company evaluates the amounts due from its suppliers on a continual basis and adjusts the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2007 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately $7.0 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from the Companys estimate. Loss Contingencies The Company accrues for loss contingencies related to litigation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The Company regularly reviews loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates. Merchandise Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 79% and 83% of the Companys inventories at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, have been determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method. If the Company had used the first in, first out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $154.9 million and $152.6 million higher than the amounts reported at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, inventory declines resulted in liquidation of LIFO layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2007 was to decrease cost of goods sold by $7.2 million and increase diluted earnings per share by $0.02. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, inventory declines resulted in liquidation of LIFO layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2005 was to decrease cost of goods sold by $30.6 million and increase diluted earnings per share by $0.09. 41 Table of Contents Business Combinations In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The Company engages third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual events. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships, non compete agreements, patents and software technology, are amortized over their useful lives. In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives under SFAS No. 142, a determination of the fair value of the Companys reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based, among other things, on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit and or the component of the entity being valued. The Company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value. This impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows, analysis of the Companys market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management. The Companys estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to the business model, or changes in operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect the Companys future financial results. The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and did not record any significant impairment charges as a result of the tests. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company performed an impairment test on certain intangible assets within the technology operations of ABDC due to the existence of impairment indicators. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.3 million relating to certain of those intangible assets. The charge was reflected in the Companys results of operations in fiscal 2005. Share Based Compensation In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R Share Based Payment, using the modified prospective transition method, and, therefore, began to expense the fair value of all options over their remaining vesting periods to the extent the options were not fully vested as of the adoption date and began to expense the fair value of all share based compensation awards granted subsequent to September 30, 2005 over their requisite service periods. The Company utilizes a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based compensation expense, which involves the use of several assumptions, including expected term of 42 Table of Contents the option, future volatility, dividend yield and forfeiture rate. The expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys stock as well as other factors, such as implied volatility. Income Taxes The Companys income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and income tax reserves reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. The Company has established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually. After application of the valuation allowances described above, the Company anticipates that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above. In addition, the Company has established an estimated liability for federal, state and non U.S. income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Uncertainties. The Company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, the Companys tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. The Company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period. The liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances, a thorough research of the technical merits of the Companys arguments and an assessment of the probability of the Company prevailing in its arguments. In all cases, the Company considers previous findings of the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. However, others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued. The significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year. If any of the Companys assumptions or estimates were to change, an increase or decrease in the Companys effective tax rate by 1% on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by $7.9 million in fiscal 2007. 43 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table illustrates the Companys debt structure at September 30, 2007, including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility (in thousands): OutstandingBalance AdditionalAvailability Fixed Rate Debt: $400,000, 5 5/8% senior notes due 2012 $ 398,500 $ $500,000, 5 7/8% senior notes due 2015 497,896 Other 1,662 Total fixed rate debt 898,058 Variable Rate Debt: Blanco revolving credit facility due 2008 55,000 Multi currency revolving credit facility due 2011 274,716 464,174 Receivables securitization facility due 2009 500,000 Other 4,094 Total variable rate debt 329,716 968,268 Total debt, including current portion $ 1,227,774 $ 968,268 The Companys $1.3 billion of aggregate availability under its revolving credit facilities and its receivables securitization facility provide sufficient sources of capital to fund the Companys working capital requirements. In November 2006, the Company entered into a new $750 million five year multi currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility) with a syndicate of lenders. The Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Companys prior variable rate debt facilities. Interest on borrowings under the Multi Currency Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based on the Companys debt rating and ranges from 19 basis points to 60 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (50 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee at September 30, 2007). Additionally, interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. The Company will pay quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi Currency Credit Facility at specified rates based on the Companys debt rating, ranging from 6 basis points to 15 basis points of the total commitment (12.5 basis points at September 30, 2007). In connection with entering into the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility, the Company incurred approximately $1.2 million of costs, which were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the facility. The Company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales. These covenants are less restrictive than those under the prior senior revolving credit facility, thereby providing the Company with greater financial flexibility. Additional covenants require compliance with financial tests, including leverage and minimum earnings to fixed charges ratios. In July 2003, the Company entered into a receivables securitization facility (Receivables Securitization Facility). In connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, ABDC sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, a wholly owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. ABDC is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. After the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. As of September 30, 2007, the maximum amount available under this facility, which now expires in November 2009, was $500 million. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper plus a program fee, 44 Table of Contents which varies based on the Companys debt ratings. The program fee was 35 basis points as of September 30, 2007. Additionally, the commitment fee on any unused credit was 12.5 basis points as of September 30, 2007. At September 30, 2007, there were no borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The facility is a financing vehicle utilized by the Company because it offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. The Company securitizes its trade accounts, which are generally non interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings under SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. The agreement governing the Receivables Securitization Facility contains restrictions and covenants which include limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, making of certain restricted payments, issuance of preferred stock, creation of certain liens, and certain corporate acts such as mergers, consolidations and sale of substantially all assets. The $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in April 2007, was amended and now expires in April 2008. The borrowing is not classified in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2007 because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. In September 2005, the Company issued $400 million of 5 5/8% senior notes due September 15, 2012 (the 2012 Notes) and $500 million of 5 7/8% senior notes due September 15, 2015 (the 2015 Notes). The 2012 Notes and 2015 Notes each were sold at 99.5% of principal amount and have an effective yield of 5.71% and 5.94%, respectively. Interest on the 2012 Notes and the 2015 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears, which commenced on March 15, 2006. Both the 2012 Notes and the 2015 Notes are redeemable at the Companys option at a price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount thereof, or the sum of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined. In addition, at any time before September 15, 2008, the Company may redeem up to an aggregate of 35% of the principal amount of the 2012 Notes or the 2015 Notes at redemption prices equal to 105.625% and 105.875%, respectively, of the principal amounts thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of redemption, with the cash proceeds of one or more equity issuances. In November 2005, Standard & Poors Ratings Services announced that it raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings on the Company to BBB from BB+. As a result of the upgrade, a substantial number of covenants under the indenture governing its 5 5/8% senior notes due 2012 and 5 7/8% senior notes due 2015 were eliminated. On June 1, 2006, Moodys Investors Service raised the Companys corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to Ba1 from Ba2. On July 21, 2006, Fitch Ratings raised the Companys corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to BBB from BBB . The Companys operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under its debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and repurchases of shares of the Companys common stock. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of its common stock, finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. The Companys cash and short term investment securities as of September 30, 2007 were $1.1 billion. In fiscal 2007, the Company purchased $1.4 billion of its common stock. As of September 30, 2007, the Company had approximately $197 million of availability remaining on its $850 million share repurchase program. In October 2007, the Company used $181 million to acquire Bellco. In November 2007, the Companys board of directors authorized an increase to the $850 million share repurchase program by $500 million, subject to market conditions. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund the Companys ongoing cash requirements. 45 Table of Contents Following is a summary of the Companys contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on its debt, minimum rental payments on its noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on its other commitments at September 30, 2007 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Within 1year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5years Debt, including interest payments $ 1,594,137 $ 112,468 $ 111,484 $ 782,060 $ 588,125 Operating leases 254,357 56,582 87,643 50,898 59,234 Other commitments 818,770 226,262 227,954 177,580 186,974 Total $ 2,667,264 $ 395,312 $ 427,081 $ 1,010,538 $ 834,333 The $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility, which expires in April 2008, is included in the Within 1 year column in the above repayment table. However, this borrowing is not classified in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2007 because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. The Company has commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through June 30, 2015. The Company is required to purchase annual doses at prices that the Company believes will represent market prices. The Company currently estimates its remaining purchase commitment under these agreements, as amended, will be approximately $577 million as of September 30, 2007. These influenza vaccine commitments are included in Other commitments in the above table. The Company outsources a significant portion of its corporate and ABDC information technology activities to IBM Global Services. The remaining commitment under this ten year outsourcing arrangement, which expires in June 2015, is approximately $137.7 million and is included in Other commitments in the above table. During fiscal 2007, the Companys operating activities provided $1,207.9 million of cash as compared to cash provided of $807.3 million in the prior fiscal year. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2007 was principally the result of net income of $469.2 million, non cash items of $220.3 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of $468.2 million, and a decrease in merchandise inventories of $285.7 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $229.3 million. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in sales and days payable outstanding. Days payable outstanding in fiscal 2007 increased by 2 days from the prior fiscal year due to favorable timing of payments to our suppliers and the strong growth of ABSG, which has a higher days payable outstanding ratio than ABDC because certain of ABSGs businesses have more favorable payment terms with their suppliers. The inventory turnover rate for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment improved to 13.6 times in fiscal 2007 from 12.2 times in the prior fiscal year. The number of inventory days on hand decreased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the benefits resulting from the Company having completed its integration plan to consolidate the ABDC distribution network and the strong growth of ABSGs business, which has lower inventory days on hand requirements. After several years of consolidation activity, the 26 U.S. ABDC distribution facilities in fiscal 2007 provided a stable distribution network environment, which combined with strong inventory management, resulted in a significant reduction in safety stock inventory. The increase in accounts receivable was due to the increase in operating revenue and an increase in average days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. Average days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment increased to 18.8 days in fiscal 2007 from 16.7 days in the prior fiscal year. This increase was largely driven by the above market rate growth of the Specialty Group, which generally has a higher receivable investment than the ABDC distribution business. Operating cash uses during fiscal 2007 included $65.9 million in interest payments and $253.2 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. 46 Table of Contents During fiscal 2006, the Companys operating activities provided $807.3 million of cash as compared to cash provided of $1,526.6 million in the prior fiscal year. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2006 was principally the result of net income of $467.7 million, non cash items of $221.4 million (of which $92.1 million represented deferred income taxes), and a $1,156.1 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes, partially offset by a $680.0 million increase in accounts receivable and a $349.5 million increase in merchandise inventories. The increase in accounts payable was primarily a result of our 13% operating revenue increase and the timing of payments to our suppliers. The increase in inventory was due to the increase in operating revenue, net of the effect of the increase in the inventory turnover rate. The inventory turnover rate for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment improved to 12.2 times in fiscal 2006 from 10.2 times in the prior fiscal year. The improvement was derived from lower average inventory levels due to an increase in the number of fee for service agreements, inventory management and other vendor agreements, and a reduction in the number of distribution facilities. The increase in accounts receivable was due to the increase in operating revenue and an increase in average days sales outstanding. Average days sales outstanding for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment increased to 16.7 days in fiscal 2006 from 15.4 days in the prior fiscal year. This increase was largely driven by the above market rate growth of the Specialty Group, which generally has a higher receivable investment than the ABDC business. Average days sales outstanding for the Other segment were 45.4 days for fiscal 2006 compared to 40.2 days in the prior fiscal year. The increase in the Other segments average days sales outstanding was primarily due to the slower reimbursement under Medicare Part D in comparison to the prior years reimbursement under Medicaid. Deferred income taxes of $92.1 million in fiscal 2006 were significantly higher than the $17.0 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to the increase in income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories. Operating cash uses during fiscal year 2006 included $62.3 million in interest payments and $107.5 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. During fiscal 2005, the Companys operating activities provided $1,526.6 million of cash as compared to cash provided of $825.1 million in the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2005 was principally the result of a $1.1 billion decrease in merchandise inventories, a $311.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes, non cash items of $282.3 million, and net income of $264.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $392.8 million. The inventory turnover rate for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment improved to 10.2 times in fiscal 2005 from 8.2 times in the prior fiscal year. The improvement was derived from lower average inventory levels due to an increase in the number of fee for service agreements, inventory management and other vendor agreements, a reduction in buy side profit opportunities, and a reduction in the number of distribution facilities. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily due to an increase in sales volume, the timing of purchases of merchandise inventories and cash payments to our vendors. The increase in accounts receivable was largely driven by the continued strong revenue growth of ABSG, which has a significantly higher average days sales outstanding than ABDC and the timing of cash receipts from our customers. Average days sales outstanding for the Other segment were 40.2 days in fiscal 2005 compared to 38.4 days in the prior fiscal year. Non cash items of $282.3 million included a $111.9 million loss on early retirement of debt and $90.9 million of depreciation and amortization. Operating cash uses during fiscal 2005 included $94.2 million in interest payments and $132.6 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $118.1 million, $113.1 million and $203.4 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 related principally to improving our information technology infrastructure, investments in ABDC warehouse expansions, equipment investments at ABSG and ABPG, equipment and furniture related to ABSGs new corporate facility, and ABPGs Illinois facility expansion. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 and 2005 related principally to the construction of our new ABDC distribution facilities, investments in warehouse expansions and improvements, information technology and warehouse automation. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2005 were significantly higher than fiscal 2006 because the Company incurred significantly more construction costs relating to its ABDC distribution facilities in fiscal 2005. The Company estimates that it will spend approximately $125 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2008. 47 Table of Contents In October 2006, the Company acquired Health Advocates, a leading provider of Medicare set aside cost containment services to insurance payors primarily within the workers compensation industry, for $83.8 million. In October 2006, the Company acquired IgG, a specialty pharmacy and infusion services business specializing in IVIG, for $37.2 million. The purchase price is subject to a contingent payment of up to approximately $8.5 million based on IgG achieving specific earnings targets in calendar year 2008. In November 2006, the Company acquired AMD, a Canadian company that provides services including reimbursement support and nursing support services, for $13.4 million. In April 2007, the Company acquired Xcenda, a consulting business which applies customized solutions and innovative approaches that discover and communicate the value of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare technologies, for $25.2 million. Additionally, in fiscal 2007, in connection with its prior fiscal year acquisition of Brecon, the Company made a contingent payment in the amount of $7.6 million to the former owners of Brecon. The Company also made other acquisition related payments of $2.9 million in fiscal 2007. On October 1, 2007, as previously noted, the Company acquired Bellco for approximately $181 million in cash. During fiscal 2006, the Company established operations in Canada by acquiring three distributors. In October 2005, the Company acquired Trent for a purchase price of $81.1 million. In March 2006, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Asenda for a purchase price of $18.2 million. The third Canadian distributor, Rep Pharm, Inc., was acquired in September 2006 for a purchase price of $47.5 million. All three businesses acquired now comprise AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation. The Company also acquired Brecon, a United Kingdom based company, for an initial purchase price of $50.2 million. The Company also acquired Network for Medical Communication & Research, LLC (NMCR) in February 2006 for a purchase price of $86.6 million and acquired certain assets of a technology solutions company relating to the Long Term Care business for $12.6 million. The assets of this technology solutions company were included in the Long Term Care divestiture transaction. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 included purchases and sales of short term investment securities. Net (purchases) proceeds relating to these investment activities in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 were ($399.6) million, $281.3 million and ($349.1) million, respectively. These short term investment securities primarily consisted of commercial paper and tax exempt variable rate demand notes used to maximize the Companys after tax interest income. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 also included proceeds from the sales of property and equipment, primarily related to the sale of certain distribution facilities and proceeds from the sales of other assets, which principally relates to the sale of certain retail pharmacy assets of the Companys Long Term Care business, prior to its divestiture. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 also included proceeds of $49.6 million from the sale of property and equipment (of which $38.0 million related to the sale of the former Bergen Brunswig headquarters in Orange, California), proceeds of $28.1 million from two sale leaseback transactions entered into by the Company with financial institutions relating to equipment previously acquired for our new distribution facilities, and $7.6 million of proceeds from the sale of an equity investment and an eminent domain settlement. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 also included $36.7 million from sale leaseback transactions entered into by the Company with a financial institution. Additionally, net cash used in investing activities included $14.6 million from the sale of substantially all of the assets of Bridge and the sale of Rita Ann. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2007 and 2006 included net borrowings of $101.8 million and $134.9 million, respectively, under the Companys revolving credit facilities primarily related to the Companys Canadian operations. In September 2005, the Company issued its 2012 Notes and its 2015 Notes for total proceeds of $895.5 million. These proceeds were used to finance the early retirement of the 7 1/4 % Notes and the 8 1/8% Notes, including the payment of premiums and other costs, for a total of $902.3 million. Additionally, in fiscal 2005, the Company paid $100 million to redeem the Bergen 7 1/ 4 % Senior Notes and repaid the remaining $180.0 million outstanding under a term loan facility. 48 Table of Contents As previously discussed, in connection with the spin off transaction, Long Term Care borrowed $125.0 million from a financial institution, and provided a one time distribution to the Company. This distribution is reflected as a financing activity on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. In August 2004, the Companys board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $500 million of its outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company acquired 13.1 million shares of its common stock for $355.3 million to complete its authorization under the August 2004 program. In February 2005, the Companys board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 11.4 million shares (substantially equivalent to the number of common stock shares issued in connection with the conversion of the 5% notes) of its outstanding common stock, subject to market conditions. In February 2005, the Company acquired 0.9 million shares in the open market for a total of $25.9 million. In addition, on March 30, 2005, the Company entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) transaction with a financial institution to purchase the remaining 10.5 million shares immediately from the financial institution at a cost of $293.8 million. The financial institution subsequently purchased an equivalent number of shares in the open market through April 21, 2005. The ASR transaction was completed on April 21, 2005, at which time the Company paid the financial institution a cash settlement of $16.6 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the Company acquired all the shares authorized under this program for a total of $336.3 million, which includes the above cash settlement of $16.6 million. The cash settlement was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital. In May 2005, the Companys board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $450 million of its outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions and to compliance with the stock repurchase restrictions contained in the indentures governing the Companys senior notes and in the credit agreement for the Companys senior credit facility. Through June 30, 2005, the Company had purchased $94.2 million of its common stock under this program for a weighted average price of $32.75. In August 2005, the Companys board of directors authorized an increase to the amount available under this program by approximately $394 million, bringing total remaining availability to $750 million, and the total repurchase program to approximately $844 million. During the fiscal year, ended September 30, 2006, the Company purchased $748.4 million of its common stock. The Company had $1.6 million of remaining authorization under this share repurchase program as of September 30, 2006. In October 2006, the Company purchased 35 thousand shares of its common stock for $1.6 million to complete this program. In August 2006, the Companys board of directors authorized a program allowing the Company to purchase up to $750 million of its outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions and to compliance with the stock purchase restrictions contained in the indentures governing the Companys senior credit facility. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the Company acquired 15.6 million shares of its common stock to complete its authorization under this program. In May 2007, the Companys board of directors authorized a new program allowing the Company to purchase up to $850 million of its outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. Through September 30, 2007, the Company purchased $652.6 million under this new program. In November 2007, the Companys board of directors authorized an increase to the $850 million share repurchase program by $500 million, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, the Company purchased a total of $1,434.4 million of its common stock in connection with its repurchase programs. From October 1, 2007 to November 16, 2007, the Company purchased 4.3 million shares for $192.1 million. The Company had approximately $505 million of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program as of November 16, 2007. 49 Table of Contents During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.05 per share and $0.025 per share, respectively. On November 8, 2007, the Companys board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 50% and declared a dividend of $0.075 per share, which will be paid on December 3, 2007 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 19, 2007. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Companys board of directors and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Market Risk The Companys most significant market risk is the effect of fluctuations in interest rates. The Company manages interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. The Company also has market risk exposure relating to its cash and cash equivalents and its short term investment securities available for sale. At September 30, 2007, the Company had $329.7 million of variable rate debt. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the Companys working capital requirements. The Company periodically evaluates various financial instruments that could mitigate a portion of its exposure to variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. There were no such financial instruments in effect at September 30, 2007. The Company had $640.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $467.4 million of short term investment securities available for sale at September 30, 2007. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and short term investment securities available for sale would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable rate debt, a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the Companys annual net interest expense by $0.5 million. The non U.S. operations of the Company are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk. The Company may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. Such contracts generally have durations of less than one year. During fiscal 2007, the Companys largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the Canadian Dollar. The Company had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at September 30, 2007. The Company may use derivative instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposures and not for speculative or trading purposes. Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. More specifically, a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company will adopt the provisions of FIN No. 48 in its first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cumulative effects, if any, of applying this interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this interpretation. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which requires an employer to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. This statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its balance sheet. SFAS No. 158 was effective for the Company as of September 30, 2007 with respect to recognition of the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in its 50 Table of Contents balance sheet. This statement also requires plan assets and benefit obligations to be measured as of the Companys balance sheet date effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of the recognition provisions of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits the Company to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial assets and liabilities that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value, on an instrument by instrument basis. If the Company elects the fair value option, it would be required to recognize changes in fair value in its earnings. This standard also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to improve comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributed for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal 2009 although early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting SFAS No. 159. Forward Looking Statements Certain of the statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and elsewhere in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may vary materially from the expectations contained in the forward looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in any forward looking statements: competitive pressures; the loss of one or more key customer or supplier relationships; customer defaults or insolvencies; changes in customer mix; supplier defaults or insolvencies; changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing and distribution policies or practices; adverse resolution of any contract or other disputes with customers (including departments and agencies of the U.S. Government) or suppliers; regulatory changes (including increased government regulation of the pharmaceutical supply channel); government enforcement initiatives (including (i) the imposition of increased obligations upon pharmaceutical distributors to detect and prevent suspicious orders of controlled substances, (ii) the commencement of further administrative actions by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration seeking to suspend or revoke the license of any of the Companys distribution facilities to distribute controlled substances, (iii) the commencement of any enforcement actions by any U.S. Attorney alleging violation of laws and regulations regarding diversion of controlled substances and suspicious order monitoring, or (iv) the commencement of any administrative actions by the board of pharmacy of any state seeking to suspend, revoke or otherwise limit the ability of any of the Companys distribution facilities or businesses to distribute or dispense pharmaceutical in such state); changes in U.S. government policies (including reimbursement changes arising from federal legislation, including the Medicare Modernization Act and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005); changes in regulatory or clinical medical guidelines and or reimbursement practices for the pharmaceuticals we distribute, including erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) used to treat anemia patients; price inflation in branded pharmaceuticals and price deflation in generics; the inability of the Company to successfully complete any transaction that the Company may wish to pursue from time to time; fluctuations in market interest rates; operational or control issues arising from the Companys outsourcing of information technology activities; success of integration, restructuring or systems initiatives; fluctuations in the U.S. dollar Canadian dollar exchange rate and other foreign exchange rates; economic, business, competitive and or regulatory developments in Canada, the United Kingdom and elsewhere outside of the United States; acquisition 51 Table of Contents of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate or control; any operating problems and or cost overruns that may be associated with the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system; changes in tax legislation or adverse resolution of challenges to our tax positions; and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and or operational factors affecting the business of the Company generally. Certain additional factors that management believes could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those described in forward looking statements are set forth elsewhere in this MD&A, in Item 1A (Risk Factors), and Item 1 (Business) and elsewhere in this report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys most significant market risks are the effects of changing interest rates and foreign currency risk.
