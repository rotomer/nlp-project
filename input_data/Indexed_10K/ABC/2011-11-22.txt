ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein. We are a pharmaceutical services company providing drug distribution and related healthcare services and solutions to our pharmacy, physician, and manufacturer customers, which are based primarily in the United States and Canada. We are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers. Substantially all of our operations are located in the United States and Canada. We also have a pharmaceutical packaging operation in the United Kingdom. Acquisitions In September 2011, we acquired IntrinsiQ, LLC (IntrinsiQ) for a purchase price of $34.3 million, net of a working capital adjustment. IntrinsiQ is a leading provider of informatics solutions that help community oncologists make treatment decisions for their patients. The acquisition of IntrinsiQ enhanced our proprietary data offerings to both physicians and manufacturers. In September 2011, we acquired Premier Source (Premier) for a purchase price of $11.1 million, net of cash acquired. Premier is a provider of consulting and reimbursement services to medical device, pharmaceutical, molecular diagnostic, and biotechnology manufacturers, as well as other health services companies. The acquisition of Premier complements the services provided by our consulting business. On November 1, 2011, we acquired TheraCom, LLC (TheraCom), a subsidiary of CVS Caremark Corporation, for a purchase price of $250.0 million, subject to a working capital adjustment. TheraCom is a leading provider of commercialization support services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, specifically providing reimbursement and patient access support services. TheraComs capabilities complement those of the Lash Group and will significantly increase the size and scope of consulting services being provided by our ABCS operating segment. TheraComs annualized revenues are approximately $700 million, the majority of which are provided by the specialized distribution component of the integrated reimbursement support services for certain unique prescription products. Approximately $60 million of these revenues were from sales to AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, which will be eliminated in our future consolidated financial statements. Pharmaceutical Distribution Our operations are comprised of one reportable segment, Pharmaceutical Distribution. The Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment represents the consolidated operating results of the Company and is comprised of four operating segments, which include the operations of AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG), AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS), and AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group (ABPG). Servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. Prior to fiscal 2011, the business operations of ABCS were included within ABSG. ABDC distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals, over the counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long term care and other alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. ABDC also provides pharmacy management, staffing and other consulting services; scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment; medication and supply dispensing cabinets; and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. ABSG, through a number of operating businesses, provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including dialysis clinics. ABSG also distributes plasma and other blood products, injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Additionally, ABSG provides third party logistics and outcomes research, and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers. ABCS, through a number of operating businesses, provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs, outcomes research, contract field staffing, patient assistance and copay assistance programs, adherence programs, risk mitigation services, and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers. 21 Table of Contents ABPG consists of American Health Packaging, Anderson Packaging (Anderson), and Brecon Pharmaceuticals Limited (Brecon). American Health Packaging delivers unit dose, punch card, unit of use, and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. American Health Packagings largest customer is ABDC and, as a result, its operations are closely aligned with the operations of ABDC. Anderson and Brecon (based in the United Kingdom) are leading providers of contract packaging and also provide clinical trials services for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Beginning in fiscal 2012, to increase our operating efficiencies and to better align our operations, each business unit within ABPG will be combined with ABDC or ABCS. More specifically, the operations of American Health Packaging will be combined with the ABDC operating segment and the operations of Anderson and Brecon will be combined with the ABCS operating segment. AmerisourceBergen Corporation Summary Financial Information 2011 2010 vs. vs. Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 2009 (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Change Change Revenue $ 80,217,558 $ 77,953,979 $ 71,759,990 2.9 % 8.6 % Gross profit $ 2,539,096 $ 2,356,642 $ 2,100,075 7.7 % 12.2 % Operating income $ 1,202,745 $ 1,103,635 $ 883,749 9.0 % 24.9 % Percentages of revenue: Gross profit 3.17 % 3.02 % 2.93 % Operating expenses 1.67 % 1.61 % 1.69 % Operating income 1.50 % 1.42 % 1.23 % Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with Year ended September 30, 2010 Operating Results Revenue of $80.2 billion in fiscal 2011 increased 2.9% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in revenue was due to the 5% growth of ABDC, offset in part by the 3% revenue decline of ABSG. During fiscal 2011, 71% of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 29% was from sales to retail customers; this compared to a customer mix in fiscal 2010 of 70% institutional and 30% retail. Sales to institutional customers increased 4% in the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers increased 1% in the current fiscal year. ABDCs revenue increased 5% from the prior fiscal year due to overall pharmaceutical market growth and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers, primarily our institutional customers. ABSGs revenue of $15.5 billion in fiscal 2011 decreased by 3% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the September 2010 discontinuance of its contract with a third party logistics customer that transitioned to a direct manufacturer distribution model. ABSGs revenue decline in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 was also attributable to a decline in sales to dialysis providers, and a shift in product mix to more generic pharmaceuticals. The majority of ABSGs revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology. ABSGs business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, especially oncology drugs, administered by physicians and anemia drugs. Since ABSG provides a number of services to or through physicians, any changes affecting this service channel could result in slower growth or reduced revenues. 22 Table of Contents We currently expect our revenue growth in fiscal 2012 to be relatively flat or to grow modestly in comparison to fiscal 2011. We expect a significant number of brand to generic drug conversions in fiscal 2012 and one of our larger retail customers, the former Longs Drugs, with annual revenue totaling $2 billion, was previously acquired by a customer of one of our competitors and did not renew its contract. As a result, we will no longer service this large customer after September 30, 2011. Our expected growth reflects U.S. pharmaceutical industry conditions, including increases in prescription drug utilization, the introduction of new products, and higher branded pharmaceutical prices, offset, in part, by the increased use of lower priced generics. Our growth also may be impacted, among other things, by industry competition and changes in customer mix. In July 2011, our largest customer, Medco Health Solutions, Inc. (Medco), which accounted for 19% of our revenue in fiscal 2011, announced its intention to merge with Express Scripts, Inc., which will be the surviving corporation and is a customer of one of our competitors. Our business with Medco contributes approximately 5% of our earnings. Our current contract with Medco continues at least through March 2013. We will make every effort to extend our relationship with the combined entity upon the expiration of our current contract; however, if we fail to do so, our revenue, earnings and cash flows would be significantly impacted. Our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends, including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers, general economic conditions in the United States, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in Federal government rules and regulations. Gross profit of $2.5 billion in fiscal 2011 increased $182.5 million or 7.7% from the prior fiscal year. The increase was greater than our revenue growth in large part due to the specialty generic product introductions (launches), the continued strong growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs and increased contributions from our fee for service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. All of the above was offset in part by normal competitive pressures on customer margins. Oxaliplatin, Gemcitabine, and Docetaxel (all generic oncology drugs), were launched in the quarters ended September 30, 2009, December 31, 2010, and March 31, 2011, respectively. The gross profit benefit achieved collectively from all three generic oncology drugs in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 was higher than the benefit achieved from Oxaliplatin alone in the prior fiscal year by approximately $96 million. Sales of Oxaliplatin, the largest contributor of the three specialty generic drugs, benefited our gross profit by approximately $106 million and $117 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We fully depleted our inventory of this product in fiscal 2011. Further quantities of Oxaliplatin are not expected to be available until the product is re launched in August 2012. Beginning in our fourth quarter ended September 30, 2011, the gross profit contributions from sales of Gemcitabine and Docetaxel began to moderate as additional pharmaceutical manufacturers offered these products for sale and as third party reimbursement rates to our customers declined. Additionally, we expect the gross profit contributions from the sales of Gemcitabine and Docetaxel to be significantly lower in fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, we expect the gross profit decline from the above mentioned three specialty generic products will be substantially offset by the expected gross profit contribution from the over 30 ABDC brand to generic product conversions that are anticipated to occur. However, there are unique circumstances surrounding the launch of each generic product and the actual gross profit from these launches can differ materially from what we expect. In the current fiscal year, we recognized a gain of $2.1 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. This compared to a recognized gain of $20.7 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in the prior fiscal year. These gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold. We are unable to estimate future gains, if any, that we will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements (see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Lastly, in fiscal 2010, we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us. Our gross profit benefited by approximately $12 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of having completed this reconciliation. As a percentage of revenue, our gross profit margin of 3.17% in fiscal 2011 improved 15 basis points from the prior fiscal year. The gross profit margin improvement was due to the above mentioned generic oncology drug launches, the strong growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs and increased contributions from our fee for service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. These factors more than offset the above market growth of some of our largest customers, who benefit from our best pricing, and normal competitive pressures on customer margins. Additionally, the gain on antitrust litigation settlements, as noted above, contributed 2 basis points to our gross profit margin in fiscal 2010. Our cost of goods sold includes a last in, first out (LIFO) provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. We recorded a LIFO charge of $34.7 million and $30.2 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. In fiscal 2011, we started to incur significant costs to support our new ERP system as we began the transition of our legacy information systems to our new ERP system. The incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms, including depreciation, are estimated to be $40 million per year during the transition period. Additionally, in fiscal 2011, ABDC implemented its Energiz program, which encompasses a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity, improve customer contractual compliance, and drive efficiency by linking our information technology capabilities more effectively with our operations. 23 Table of Contents Operating expenses of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2011 increased $83.3 million or 6.7% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms (including depreciation), an increase in consulting expenses related to ABDCs Energiz program, and an increase in employee severance, litigation and other costs. In fiscal 2011, we incurred severance costs of $4.4 million related to our Energiz program, we recorded a $16.0 million charge related to the preliminary Qui Tam settlement (the Qui Tam Matter as described in Note 12 Legal Matters and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), we incurred $3.2 million of costs related to business acquisitions, and we incurred a $6.5 million charge related to intangible asset impairments. In the prior fiscal year, asset impairment charges included a write off of capitalized software of $6.7 million (included within distribution, selling and administrative expenses) and intangible asset impairment charges of $3.2 million. Additionally, the prior fiscal year benefited from the reversal of a $4.4 million legal accrual. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 1.67% in fiscal 2011, and increased by 6 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the same matters as noted above and was offset, in part, by our operating leverage, particularly within ABDC. Operating income of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011 increased $99.1 million or 9.0% from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in our gross profit. As a percentage of revenue, operating income increased 8 basis points to 1.50% in fiscal 2011 due to the increase in our gross profit margin, offset in part by the increase in our operating expense margin. The net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements, the costs relating to employee severance, litigation and other, and the asset impairments decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 3 basis points in fiscal 2011 and increased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 2 basis points in fiscal 2010. Other income of $4.6 million in fiscal 2011 primarily related to a gain resulting from payments received in excess of amounts accrued on a note receivable relating to a prior business disposition. Other loss of $3.4 million in fiscal 2010 primarily related to a loss incurred on an equity investment. Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in thousands): 2011 2010 Weighted Average Weighted Average Amount Interest Rate Amount Interest Rate Interest expense $ 78,902 5.31 % $ 74,805 5.19 % Interest income (2,181 ) 0.19 % (2,311 ) 0.21 % Interest expense, net $ 76,721 $ 72,494 Interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate and a decline in interest costs capitalized relating to our Business Transformation project. Interest costs capitalized have the effect of reducing interest expense and were $3.4 million and $6.6 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate and an increase in the amount of cash held in non interest bearing cash accounts. Our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings, interest rates, amendments to our current borrowing facilities, and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash. We expect our interest expense to be significantly higher in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the November 2011 issuance of our 31/2% senior notes due 2021, as described further within Liquidity and Capital Resources. Income taxes in fiscal 2011 reflect an effective tax rate of 37.5%, compared to 38.0% in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to adjustments made relating to state deferred income taxes. We continue to expect that our ongoing effective tax rate will be approximately 38.4%. 24 Table of Contents Net income of $706.6 million in fiscal 2011 increased 11.0% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in operating income. Diluted earnings per share of $2.54 in fiscal 2011 increased 14.4% from $2.22 in the prior fiscal year. The difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in net income was primarily due to the 3% reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding, primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase programs (as described within Liquidity and Capital Resources), net of the impact of stock option exercises. Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with Year ended September 30, 2009 Operating Results Revenue of $78.0 billion in fiscal 2010, which included bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, increased 8.6% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in revenue was due to the 10% growth of ABDC and the 5% growth of ABSG. During fiscal 2010, 70% of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 30% was sales to retail customers; this compared to a customer mix in fiscal 2009 of 69% institutional and 31% retail. Sales to institutional customers increased 10% in the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers increased 6% in the current fiscal year. ABDCs revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by 10% from the prior fiscal year due to overall pharmaceutical market growth; revenue from our new customers, primarily new buying group customers with which we started doing business in March and April of 2009 and a new alternate site customer which we added in August 2009 (collectively representing approximately 4% of ABDCs revenue growth in fiscal 2010); and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers. ABSGs revenue in fiscal 2010 of $16.0 billion increased 5% from the prior fiscal year due to growth of its distribution businesses, primarily relating to the distribution of nephrology and blood products and its third party logistics business. The majority of ABSGs revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology. Gross profit of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2010 increased by $256.6 million or 12% from the prior fiscal year. This increase was in large part attributable to our revenue growth, the continued strong growth and profitability of our generic programs (with generic revenue increasing by 17% in comparison to the prior fiscal year) and increased contributions from fee for service agreements with brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers. In August 2009, a generic oncology drug, Oxaliplatin, was introduced (launched) and ABSGs gross profit significantly benefited from this generic launch in fiscal 2010. The gross profit benefit that we received from this generic launch significantly exceeded the typical benefit we have experienced in the past from generic launches. Approximately one third of the gross profit increase for fiscal 2010 was derived from this new generic product launch. Additionally, in fiscal 2010, we recognized a gain of $20.7 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. This gain was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold. Lastly, in fiscal 2010, we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us. Our gross profit benefited by approximately $12 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of having completed this reconciliation. As a percentage of revenue, our gross profit margin of 3.02% in fiscal 2010 improved by 9 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the strong growth and profitability of our generic programs, including new and recent generic launches, and increased contributions from fee for service agreements with brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers. Additionally, the gain on antitrust litigation settlements, as noted above, had the effect of increasing our gross profit margin by 2 basis points in fiscal 2010. All of these factors more than offset the above market growth of some of our largest customers, who benefit from our best pricing, and normal competitive pressures on customer margins. We recorded a LIFO charge of $30.2 million and $15.1 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in our LIFO charge reflects strong brand name price inflation and a year over year reduction in generic price deflation. 25 Table of Contents Operating expenses of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2010 increased by $36.7 million or 3% from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in bad debt expense of $11.3 million primarily relating to physician customers within ABSGs oncology business, an increase in incentive compensation, an increase in depreciation and amortization of $7.6 million, and additional expenses incurred relating to our Business Transformation project, which includes a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The above increases were offset, in part, by a $9.9 million reduction in employee severance, litigation and other costs and a $4.7 million reduction in asset impairment charges. Asset impairment charges in the current fiscal year included a write off of capitalized software of $6.7 million (included within distribution, selling and administrative expenses) and intangible asset impairment charges of $3.2 million. Asset impairment charges in the prior fiscal year included intangible asset impairment charges of $11.8 million and the write off of capitalized software of $2.8 million (included within distribution, selling and administrative expenses). As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 1.61% in fiscal 2010 and represented a significant 8 basis point decline in our operating expense ratio from the prior fiscal year, reflecting our strong operating leverage particularly within ABDC as its operating expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal 2010 in comparison to the prior fiscal year, despite its 10% revenue growth. Our operating leverage has benefited from significant productivity increases achieved from our highly automated distribution facilities and our cE2 initiative, as described below. In July 2010 and October 2010, we implemented the first and second phases of our new ERP system. As a result, we started to depreciate a significant portion of our capitalized project costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Additionally, we started to incur other significant costs to support our new ERP system as we began the transition from our legacy information systems to our ERP system. In fiscal 2008, we announced a more streamlined organizational structure and introduced an initiative (cE2) designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost effectiveness. In connection with these efforts, we reduced various operating costs and terminated certain positions. In fiscal 2009, we terminated 197 employees and incurred $3.1 million of employee severance costs relating to our cE2 initiative. Additionally, in fiscal 2009, we recorded $2.2 million of expense to increase our liability relating to a former executive employee matter. In fiscal 2010, we reversed our remaining $4.4 million liability relating to this matter. Operating income of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2010 increased $219.9 million or 25% from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in our gross profit. As a percentage of revenue, operating income increased 19 basis points to 1.42% in fiscal 2010 due to the increase in our gross profit margin and the decrease in our operating expense ratio. The net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements, the benefit from employee severance, litigation and other, and the intangible asset impairments increased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 3 basis points in fiscal 2010. The costs of employee severance, litigation and other, and the intangible asset impairments decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 2 basis points in fiscal 2009. Interest expense, interest income, and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in thousands): 2010 2009 Weighted Average Weighted Average Amount Interest Rate Amount Interest Rate Interest expense $ 74,805 5.19 % $ 63,502 4.88 % Interest income (2,311 ) 0.21 % (5,195 ) 0.85 % Interest expense, net $ 72,494 $ 58,307 Interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of $183.2 million in average borrowings, offset in part, by an increase in interest costs capitalized relating to our Business Transformation project and a decrease in the weighted average variable interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to 1.71% from 2.08% in the prior fiscal year. Interest costs capitalized in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were $6.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate, offset in part, by an increase in average invested cash of $578.3 million. Average borrowings increased in fiscal 2010 resulting from the November 2009 issuance of $400 million of ten year senior notes, offset in part, by the repayment of substantially all amounts then outstanding under our multi currency revolving credit facility (both described in Liquidity and Capital Resources). 26 Table of Contents Income taxes in fiscal 2010 reflect an effective income tax rate of 38.0%, compared to 37.9% in the prior fiscal year. Due to the impact of discrete tax events, we were able to recognize certain federal and state tax benefits in fiscal 2010 and 2009, thereby reducing our effective tax rate from a normalized 38.4%. Income from continuing operations of $636.7 million in fiscal 2010 increased 24% from $511.9 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in operating income. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.22 in fiscal 2010 increased 31% from $1.69 per share in the prior fiscal year. The difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the 5% reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding, primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program (see Liquidity and Capital Resources), net of the impact of stock option exercises. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For a complete list of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, and our customers financial strength, credit standing, and payment and default history. Changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. Each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise. We write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote. Each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly. There were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. The bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts, net of write offs, recoveries and other adjustments. Schedule II of this Form 10 K sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $39.3 million, $43.1 million, and $31.8 million respectively. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2011 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately $3.9 million. Supplier Reserves We establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us. We evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2011 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately $9.2 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate. 27 Table of Contents Loss Contingencies An estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of our accruals and related disclosures. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates. Merchandise Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 80% and 78% of our inventories at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, has been determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method. If we had used the first in, first out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $256.0 million and $221.3 million higher than the amounts reported at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We recorded a LIFO charge of $34.7 million, $30.2 million, and $15.1 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 respectively. Business Combinations The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. We engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual events. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired entity over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships, non compete agreements, patents and software technology, are amortized over their estimated useful lives. In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, a determination of the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based, among other things, on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit and or the component of the entity being valued. We are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value (impairment indicators). This impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows, analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management. We completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, and, as a result, recorded $6.5 million, $2.5 million, and $1.6 million of impairment charges, respectively. In fiscal 2009, due to the existence of impairment indicators at U.S. Bioservices, a specialty pharmacy company within our Specialty Group, we performed an impairment test on the pharmacys trade name as of June 30, 2009, which resulted in an impairment charge of $8.9 million. Our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to the business model, or changes in operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results. Share Based Compensation We utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based compensation expense, which involves the use of several assumptions, including expected term of the option, future volatility, dividend yield and forfeiture rate. The expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors, such as implied volatility. 28 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually. After application of the valuation allowances described above, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. However, others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued. The significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year. If any of our assumptions or estimates were to change, an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by $11.3 million in fiscal 2011. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table illustrates our debt structure at September 30, 2011, including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility (in thousands): Outstanding Additional Balance Availability Fixed Rate Debt: $392,326, 5 5/8% senior notes due 2012 $ 392,000 $ $500,000, 5 7/8% senior notes due 2015 498,822 $400,000, 4 7/8% senior notes due 2019 397,190 Other 89 Total fixed rate debt 1,288,101 Variable Rate Debt: Blanco revolving credit facility due 2012 55,000 Multi currency revolving credit facility due 2016 21,851 667,779 Receivables securitization facility due 2014 700,000 Other 1,558 Total variable rate debt 76,851 1,369,337 Total debt, including current portion $ 1,364,952 $ 1,369,337 Along with our cash balances, our aggregate availability under our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements. 29 Table of Contents In November 2011, we issued $500 million of 31/2% senior notes due November 15, 2021 (the 2021 Notes). The 2021 Notes were sold at 99.858% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 3.52%. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semiannually, in arrears, commencing May 15, 2012. The 2021 Notes rank pari passu to the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility and the 2012 Notes, the 2015 Notes, and the 2019 Notes (all defined below). We will use the net proceeds of the 2021 Notes for general corporate purposes. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes will be deferred and amortized over the ten year term of the notes. We have a $700 million multi currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in March 2015, (the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility) with a syndicate of lenders. In October 2011, we entered into an amendment with the syndicate of lenders to extend the maturity date of the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility to October 2016. The amendment also reduced our borrowing rates and facility fees. Interest on borrowings under the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 68 basis points to 155 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (currently 90 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee). Additionally, interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on our debt rating, ranging from 7 basis points to 20 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (currently 10 basis points). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales. On October 31, 2011, we established a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $700 million at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program is fully backed by our Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility. We have a $700 million receivables securitization facility (Receivables Securitization Facility), which was scheduled to expire in April 2014. In October 2011, we entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Facility to extend the maturity date to October 2014. The amendment also reduced our borrowing rates. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are currently based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper or LIBOR plus a program fee of 75 basis points. We currently pay an unused fee of 37.5 basis points, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. At September 30, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, ABDC sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, a wholly owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. ABDC is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. After the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. We use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. In April 2011, we amended the $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility, (the Blanco Credit Facility) to extend the maturity date to April 2012. Borrowings under the Blanco Credit Facility are guaranteed by us. Interest on borrowings under this facility accrues at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Blanco Credit Facility is not classified in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011 because we have the ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. We have $392.3 million of 5 5/8% senior notes due September 15, 2012 (the 2012 Notes), $500 million of 5 7/8% senior notes due September 15, 2015 (the 2015 Notes), and $400 million of 4 7/8% senior notes due November 15, 2019 (the 2019 Notes). The 2012 Notes and 2015 Notes each were sold at 99.5% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 5.71% and 5.94%, respectively. The 2019 Notes were sold in November 2009 at 99.174% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 4.98%. Interest on the 2012 Notes, the 2015 Notes, and the 2019 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears. All of the senior notes rank pari passu to the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility. Our operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and repurchases of shares of our common stock. 30 Table of Contents Deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. In addition, volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations. Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures (including our Business Transformation project, which involves the implementation of our new ERP system) and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. In August 2011, our board of directors approved a new program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. In September 2010 and November 2009, our board of directors approved programs allowing us to purchase up to $500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. We purchased $848.1 million of our common stock in fiscal 2011, of which $98.1 million was purchased to close out our November 2009 share repurchase program, $500.0 was purchased to close out our September 2010 share repurchase program, and $250.0 million was purchased under the August 2011 share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2011, we had $500.0 million of availability remaining on the August 2011 share repurchase program. We currently expect to purchase approximately $400.0 million of our common stock in fiscal 2012, subject to market conditions. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements. Following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at September 30, 2011 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Within 1 After 5 Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Years Debt, including interest payments $ 1,676,831 $ 519,271 $ 98,832 $ 590,478 $ 468,250 Operating leases 215,524 43,791 69,370 49,301 53,062 Other commitments 277,832 148,275 106,286 23,271 Total $ 2,170,187 $ 711,337 $ 274,488 $ 663,050 $ 521,312 The $55 million Blanco Credit Facility, which expires in April 2012, is included in the Within 1 year column in the above table. However, this borrowing is not classified in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011 because we have the ability and intent to refinance it on a long term basis. We have commitments to purchase blood plasma products from suppliers through December 31, 2012. We are required to purchase quantities at prices that we believe will represent market prices. We currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately $121.2 million as of September 30, 2011, of which $95.7 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2012. These commitments are included in Other commitments in the above table. We have outsourced to IBM Global Services (IBM) a significant portion of our corporate and ABDC information technology activities including assistance with the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The remaining commitment under our 10 year arrangement, as amended, which expires in June 2015, is approximately $128.6 million as of September 30, 2011, of which $39.4 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2012, and is included in Other commitments in the above table. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $45.7 million (including interest and penalties) as of September 30, 2011. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table. 31 Table of Contents During fiscal 2011, our operating activities provided $1,167.9 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of $1,108.6 million in the prior fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was principally the result of net income of $706.6 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of $406.4 million, and non cash items of $394.0 million, offset, in part, by an increase in merchandise inventories of $272.3 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $35.5 million. Non cash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of $195.0 million, which represents an increase of $109.5 million from the prior fiscal year and is primarily attributable to income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories and tax bonus depreciation resulting from our Business Transformation capital expenditures. Significant tax bonus depreciation is not expected to be available to us in our fiscal year ending September 30, 2012. Our inventory and accounts payable balances at September 30, 2011 were 5% and 4% higher, respectively, than those balances at September 30, 2010. These increases were largely attributable to the growth in our business in fiscal 2011. The average number of inventory days on hand in fiscal 2011 decreased to 24.5 days from 25.0 days in the prior fiscal year. The average number of days payable outstanding in fiscal 2011 decreased to 33.1 days from 33.6 days in the prior fiscal year. Despite the 3% increase in revenue in fiscal 2011, accounts receivable at September 30, 2011 was relatively flat when compared to the balance at September 30, 2010. This was primarily due to timing of customer payments to us. Our average number of days sales outstanding during fiscal 2011 and 2010 was consistent at 17.3 days. Operating cash uses during fiscal 2011 included $74.2 million of interest payments and $214.6 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. During fiscal 2010, our operating activities provided $1,108.6 million of cash as compared to cash provided of $783.8 million in the prior fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was principally the result of net income of $636.7 million, non cash items of $280.0 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of $385.4 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $61.2 million, offset, in part, by an increase in merchandise inventories of $243.0 million. Non cash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of $85.5 million, which primarily related to tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories. Despite the 9% increase in revenue in fiscal 2010, accounts receivable at September 30, 2010 decreased by 2% from September 30, 2009 as the average number of days sales outstanding during fiscal 2010 decreased by nearly one day to 17.3 days from the prior fiscal year, reflecting improved cash collection efforts, favorable customer mix, and timing of customer receipts. Our inventory and accounts payable balances at September 30, 2010 were 5% higher and 4% higher, respectively, than those balances at September 30, 2009. These increases were largely attributed to the growth in our business in fiscal 2010. However, the increases were lower than our revenue growth in fiscal 2010 because our inventory and accounts payable balances at September 30, 2009 were higher than normal as we made inventory purchases of approximately $400 million in the month of September 2009, primarily relating to purchases of the generic oncology drug launched in August 2009 and purchases made in advance of a manufacturers temporary plant shutdown in connection with its facility consolidation efforts. The average number of inventory days on hand in fiscal 2010 was consistent with the prior fiscal year. The number of average days payable outstanding in fiscal 2010 increased to 33.6 days from 32.8 days in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers and a change in product mix to more generic pharmaceuticals which generally have more favorable payment terms. Operating cash uses during fiscal 2010 included $63.8 million in interest payments and $257.8 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $168.0 million, $184.6 million, and $145.8 million, respectively. We currently expect to spend approximately $150 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2012. Our most significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 related principally to our Business Transformation project, which includes a new ERP system for our corporate office and for our ABDC operations. Other capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 included ABDC purchases of machinery and equipment, which were previously sold to financial institutions and leased back by us, and other technology initiatives. Other capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 included various enhancements made to our other business units information and customer related technology systems. In September 2011, we acquired IntrinsiQ, LLC (IntrinsiQ), a leading provider of informatics solutions that help community oncologists make treatment decisions for their patients, for a purchase price of $34.3 million, net of a working capital adjustment. Additionally, in September 2011, we acquired Premier Source (Premier), a provider of consulting and reimbursement services to medical device, pharmaceutical, molecular diagnostic, and biotechnology manufacturers, as well as other health services companies, for a purchase price of $11.1 million, net of cash acquired. In May 2009, we acquired Innomar, a Canadian specialty pharmaceutical services company, for a purchase price of $13.4 million, net of a working capital adjustment. In October 2008, we sold PMSI for approximately $31 million, net of a final working capital adjustment. We received cash totaling $11.9 million and a $19 million subordinated note due from PMSI on the fifth anniversary of the closing date. In October 2010, we received $4 million of the total $19 million note due from PMSI as it achieved certain revenue targets with respect to its largest customer. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 included net borrowings of $22.4 million under our revolving and securitization credit facilities. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2010 included $396.7 million of proceeds received related to the November 2009 issuance of our 2019 Notes and net repayments of $226.0 million under our revolving and securitization credit facilities. Additionally, $7.7 million of discretionary long term debt repayments were made in fiscal 2010. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2009 included net repayments of $8.8 million under our revolving and securitization credit facilities. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we purchased a total of $840.6 million, $470.4 million, and $450.4 million, respectively, of our common stock in connection with our share repurchase programs, which are summarized below. 32 Table of Contents In November 2008, our board of directors authorized a program allowing the purchase of up to $500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2009, we purchased $431.9 million under this program and during fiscal 2010, we purchased $68.1 million to complete the program. In November 2009, our board of directors authorized a program allowing us to purchase up to $500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2010, we purchased $401.9 million under this program and during fiscal 2011, we purchased $98.1 million to complete the program. In September 2010, our board of directors authorized a program allowing us to purchase up to $500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions, all of which was purchased during fiscal 2011. In August 2011, our board of directors authorized a new program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2011, we purchased $250.0 million under this program, of which $8.0 million was cash settled in October 2011. In November 2008, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 33% to $0.05 per share. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.05 per share. In May 2009, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.06 per share and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share. In November 2009, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 33% from $0.06 per share to $0.08 per share. During fiscal 2010, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.08 per share. In November 2010, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 25% from $0.08 per share to $0.10 per share. In May 2011, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 15% from $0.10 per share to $0.115 per share. In November 2011, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend again by 13% from $0.115 per share to $0.13 per share. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Market Risk Our most significant market risk historically has been the effect of fluctuations in interest rates relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. At September 30, 2011, we had $76.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect at September 30, 2011. We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2011. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable rate debt, a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million. We are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the Canadian Dollar. We may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. Such contracts generally have durations of less than one year. We had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at September 30, 2011. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Effective October 1, 2009, we adopted the applicable sections of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations, which provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non controlling interest in the acquired business. Additionally, this ASC provides disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. We also adopted certain other applicable sections that address application issues raised on the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities relating to contingencies from a business combination. We expensed acquisition related costs of $3.2 million in the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2011 relating to our completed or pending business combinations. 33 Table of Contents In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU No. 2011 05 requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate, but consecutive statements. ASU No. 2011 05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating our presentation options under ASU No. 2011 05; however, we do not expect adoption of this guidance to impact our consolidated financial statements other than the change in presentation. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. Under ASU No. 2011 08, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the entity determines that this threshold is not met, then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary. ASU No. 2011 08 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2011, and early adoption is permitted. We intend to early adopt this ASU in our fiscal year ending September 30, 2012. Forward Looking Statements Certain of the statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) and elsewhere in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change in circumstances. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied are the following: changes in pharmaceutical market growth rates; the loss of one or more key customer or supplier relationships; changes in customer mix; customer delinquencies, defaults or insolvencies; supplier defaults or insolvencies; changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing and distribution policies or practices; adverse resolution of any contract or other dispute with customers or suppliers; federal and state government enforcement initiatives to detect and prevent suspicious orders of controlled substances and the diversion of controlled substances; qui tam litigation for alleged violations of fraud and abuse laws and regulations and or other laws and regulations governing the marketing, sale and purchase of pharmaceutical products or any related litigation, including shareholder derivative lawsuits; changes in federal and state legislation or regulatory action affecting pharmaceutical product pricing or reimbursement policies, including under Medicaid and Medicare; changes in regulatory or clinical medical guidelines and or labeling for the pharmaceutical products we distribute, including certain anemia products; price inflation in branded pharmaceuticals and price deflation in generics; greater or less than anticipated benefit from launches of the generic versions of previously patented pharmaceutical products; significant breakdown or interruption of our information technology systems; our inability to implement an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to handle business and financial processes and transactions (including processes and transactions relating to our customers and suppliers) of AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation operations and our corporate operations without functional problems, unanticipated delays and or cost overruns; success of integration, restructuring or systems initiatives; interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; economic, business, competitive and or regulatory developments in Canada, the United Kingdom and elsewhere outside of the United States, including potential changes in Canadian provincial legislation affecting pharmaceutical product pricing or service fees or regulatory action by provincial authorities in Canada to lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees; the impact of divestitures or the acquisition of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate or control; our inability to successfully complete any other transaction that we may wish to pursue from time to time; changes in tax laws or legislative initiatives that could adversely affect our tax positions and or our tax liabilities or adverse resolution of challenges to our tax positions; increased costs of maintaining, or reductions in our ability to maintain, adequate liquidity and financing sources; volatility and deterioration of the capital and credit markets; and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and or operational factors affecting our business generally. Certain additional factors that management believes could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those described in forward looking statements are set forth elsewhere in this MDA, in Item 1A (Risk Factors), Item 1 (Business) and elsewhere in this report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys most significant market risks are the effects of changing interest rates and foreign currency risk.
