ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained herein. We are a pharmaceutical services company serving the United States, Canada, and selected global markets. We provide drug distribution and related healthcare services and solutions to our pharmacy, physician, and manufacturer customers. We are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers. Our operations are comprised of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Reportable segment and Other. As of September 30, 2012, we committed to a plan to divest AndersonBrecon (a business unit within AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services); therefore, its operations are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. All historical information provided herein has been retroactively adjusted to conform to our current presentation. Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment The Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments, which include the operations of AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation ("ABDC") and AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group ("ABSG"). Servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. ABDC distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name pharmaceuticals (including specialty pharmaceutical products) and generic pharmaceuticals, over the counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long term care and other alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. ABDC also provides pharmacy management, staffing and other consulting services; scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment; medication and supply dispensing cabinets; and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. Additionally, ABDC delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. ABSG, through a number of operating businesses, provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including dialysis clinics. ABSG also distributes plasma and other blood products, injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Additionally, ABSG provides third party logistics and outcomes research, and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our use of the term "specialty" and "specialty pharmaceutical products" refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. Specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring. We believe the terms "specialty" and "specialty pharmaceutical products" are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors. However, we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do. Other Other consists of the AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services ("ABCS") operating segment and the recently acquired World Courier Group, Inc. ("World Courier") operating segment. The results of operations of our ABCS and World Courier operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure, and, therefore, have been included in "Other" for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation. ABCS, through a number of operating businesses, provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs, outcomes research, contract field staffing, patient assistance and copay assistance programs, adherence programs, risk mitigation services, and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers. World Courier, which operates in over 50 countries, is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. Acquisitions In November 2011, we acquired TheraCom, LLC ("TheraCom"), a subsidiary of CVS Caremark Corporation, for a purchase price of $257.2 million, net of a working capital adjustment. TheraCom is a leading provider of commercialization support services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, specifically providing reimbursement and patient access support services. TheraComs capabilities complement those of the Lash Group, a business unit within ABCS, and significantly increase the size and scope of its consulting services. TheraComs annualized revenues are approximately $700 million, the majority of which are provided by the specialized distribution component of the integrated reimbursement support services for certain unique prescription products. In April 2012, we acquired World Courier Group, Inc. ("World Courier") for a purchase price of $518.0 million, net of a working capital adjustment. World Courier is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. World Courier further strengthens our service offerings to global pharmaceutical manufacturers and provides an established platform for the introduction of our specialty services outside North America. It operates in over 50 countries and has approximately 2,500 employees. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year ended September 30, 2012 compared with Year ended September 30, 2011 Revenue Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2012 2011 Change Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 78,349,334 $ 79,753,118 1.8% Other 1,324,744 302,012 338.6% Intersegment eliminations (184,482 ) (51,286 ) 259.7% Revenue $ 79,489,596 $ 80,003,844 0.6% Revenue of $79.5 billion in fiscal 2012 decreased 0.6% from the prior fiscal year as ABDCs revenue declined 3%, and was partially offset by the 6% revenue increase of ABSG. Additionally, our recent acquisitions, with TheraCom and World Courier being the largest contributors, added 1% to our revenue growth in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. We currently expect our revenue in fiscal 2013 to increase between 6% and 9%. Our expected growth rate reflects our new three year contract with Express Scripts, Inc. ("Express Scripts") that is effective as of October 1, 2012, to supply primarily brand name pharmaceuticals. Annual sales to Express Scripts in fiscal 2013 under this contract are estimated to be $18.5 billion. In early April 2012, our largest customer, Medco Health Solutions, Inc. ("Medco"), merged with Express Scripts, which is the surviving corporation. Medco accounted for 17% of our revenue in fiscal 2012. In addition, fiscal 2013 will include a full years operating results of our fiscal 2012 acquisitions of TheraCom and World Courier. Our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends, including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers, general economic conditions in the United States, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in Federal government rules and regulations. Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment ABDCs revenue decreased 3% from the prior fiscal year. The decline in ABDCs revenue was primarily due to the increase in use of lower priced generics, a reduction in chain customer revenue primarily due to the previously announced loss of one of our larger retail customers, the former Longs Drugs, which was acquired by a customer of one of our competitors and did not renew its contract prior to September 30, 2011, and lower sales to its largest customer. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in brand name pharmaceutical prices. ABSGs revenue of $16.4 billion in fiscal 2012 increased 6% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in its third party logistics business and growth in its vaccine and physician office distribution business, which has benefited from sales of a new ophthalmology drug. ABSGs revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in sales of certain specialty oncology drugs. The majority of ABSGs revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology. ABSGs business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the Medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals, especially oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs. Since ABSG provides a number of services to or through physicians, any changes affecting this service channel could result in slower growth or reduced revenues. During fiscal 2012, 72% of Pharmaceutical Distribution revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 28% was from sales to retail customers; this compared to a customer mix in fiscal 2011 of 70% institutional and 30% retail. Sales to institutional customers remained flat in the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers decreased 7% from the prior fiscal year. Other Other revenue increased $1,022.7 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the $959.9 million contribution from our TheraCom and World Courier acquisitions. Gross Profit Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2012 2011 Change Gross profit $ 2,669,098 $ 2,501,595 6.7% 21 Table of Contents Gross profit in fiscal 2012 increased $167.5 million from the prior fiscal year due to the contributions made by our recent acquisitions (primarily World Courier and TheraCom), the solid growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs, and brand price increases, all of which were offset, in part, by the reduced contribution from the sales of certain specialty oncology drugs, and by competitive pressures on customer margins. As expected, in fiscal 2012, the gross profit contributions from the sales of Oxaliplatin, Gemcitabine, and Docetaxel (all generic oncology drugs) were approximately $132 million lower than the prior fiscal year. We had no sales of Oxaliplatin in our current fiscal year until mid August 2012 and; therefore, gross profit on the sale of Oxaliplatin was significantly lower than in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, the gross profit decline from the above mentioned three specialty generic drugs was partially offset by the gross profit contribution from over 30 ABDC brand to generic product conversions. In the current fiscal year, we recognized a gain of $14.8 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. This compared to a recognized gain of $2.1 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in the prior fiscal year. These gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold. We are unable to estimate future gains, if any, that we will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements (see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, in fiscal 2011, our gross profit was impacted by a non recurring $12 million benefit in connection with a customer being acquired by a third party. As a percentage of revenue, our gross profit margin of 3.36% in fiscal 2012 increased 23 basis points from the prior fiscal year. The gross profit margin increase was due to the gross profit contributions of our recent acquisitions, primarily World Courier and TheraCom, and the solid growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs, both of which were offset by the decline in gross profit relating to the above mentioned specialty oncology generic drugs. Additionally, the gain on antitrust litigation settlements, as noted above, contributed 2 basis points to our gross profit margin in fiscal 2012. Our cost of goods sold includes a last in, first out ("LIFO") provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. We recorded a LIFO charge of $0.7 million and $34.7 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our LIFO charge in fiscal 2012 was lower than the prior fiscal year charge due to higher brand inventory sales prior to the end of our fiscal year. Operating Expenses Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2012 2011 Change Distribution, selling and administrative $ 1,229,495 $ 1,179,234 4.3% Depreciation and amortization 141,054 105,482 33.7% Employee severance, litigation and other 45,821 23,567 94.4% Intangible asset impairments 6,506 100.0% Total operating expenses $ 1,416,370 $ 1,314,789 7.7% Distribution, selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2012 increased 4.3% due to the operating costs of our recently acquired companies and was partially offset by a reduction in consulting expenses within our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and a decrease in our bad debt expense. Depreciation expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the implementation of our new ERP system. Amortization expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the newly acquired intangible assets resulting from the TheraCom and World Courier acquisitions. In fiscal 2012, we introduced a number of initiatives, some of which were made possible as a result of efficiencies gained through our ERP implementation, to improve our operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions. In connection with these initiatives, we recorded $34.7 million of severance and other related costs and through September 30, 2012, 47 employees have been severed. Other costs include an estimated $10.3 million liability to exit our participation in a multi employer pension plan resulting from a planned ABDC distribution facility closure in fiscal 2013. In addition, we incurred $11.1 million of acquisition costs related to business combinations. In fiscal 2011, we introduced our Energiz program, which encompasses a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity, improve customer contractual compliance, and drive efficiency by linking our information technology capabilities more effectively with our operations. Employee severance, litigation and other for fiscal 2011 included severance costs of $4.4 million related to our Energiz program, a $16.0 million charge related to the preliminary settlement of a Qui Tam matter (as described in Note 12 "Legal Matters and Contingencies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and $3.2 million of acquisition costs related to business combinations. We incurred a $6.5 million charge related to intangible asset impairments in fiscal 2011. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 1.78% in fiscal 2012, up 14 basis points from the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to our recent acquisitions. For the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, as a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were down 4 basis points from the prior fiscal year. 22 Table of Contents Operating Income Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2012 2011 Change Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 1,226,430 $ 1,181,959 3.8% Other 72,119 28,414 153.8% Employee severance, litigation and other (45,821 ) (23,567 ) 94.4% Operating income $ 1,252,728 $ 1,186,806 5.6% Segment operating income is evaluated before employee severance, litigation and other. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income increased $44.5 million from the prior fiscal year due to the decrease in its operating expenses, offset in part by a decrease in its gross profit. Other operating income increased $43.7 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the $24.6 million of contributions made by our recent acquisitions, primarily World Courier and TheraCom. We expect our operating income margin to decline in fiscal 2013 due to our new Express Scripts contract, which significantly increases our mix of lower margin brand business, the loss of a large food/drug combo customer, the negative impact of certain customer contract renewals, and a lower number of brand to generic conversions expected in fiscal 2013. The net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements, the costs relating to employee severance, litigation and other, and the asset impairments was to decrease operating income as a percentage of revenue by 4 basis points in both fiscal 2012 and 2011. Other income of $5.8 million in fiscal 2012 and $4.6 million in fiscal 2011 primarily related to a gain resulting from payments received in excess of amounts accrued on a note receivable relating to a prior business disposition. Interest expense, interest income, and the respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were as follows (in thousands): 2012 2011 Amount Weighted Average Interest Rate Amount Weighted Average Interest Rate Interest expense $ 97,225 4.76% $ 78,870 5.31% Interest income (1,801 ) 0.22% (2,181 ) 0.19% Interest expense, net $ 95,424 $ 76,689 Interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of $494.4 million in average borrowings, primarily due to the November 2011 issuance of our new $500 million 31/2% senior notes due 2021. In addition, interest costs capitalized related to our Business Transformation project of $0.5 million and $3.4 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively had the effect of reducing interest expense for those periods. Our average invested cash was $1.5 billion during both fiscal 2012 and 2011. Despite the similar levels of average cash, interest income was lower in our current fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of cash held in non interest bearing cash accounts. Cash held in these accounts partially offset bank fees. Our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings, interest rates, amendments to our current borrowing facilities, and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash. We currently expect our interest expense to be lower in fiscal 2013 since we repaid our $392 million of 55/8% senior notes in September 2012. Income taxes in fiscal 2012 reflect an effective tax rate of 39.1%, compared to 37.6% in the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily the result of a valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets primarily relating to our Canadian drug distribution operations. We expect that our ongoing effective tax rate will be approximately 39%. Income from continuing operations of $708.2 in fiscal 2012 increased 2% from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in operating income and was offset in part by the increases in interest expense and income taxes. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.76 in fiscal 2012 increased 10% from $2.51 per share in the prior fiscal year. The difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the 8% reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding, primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program (see Liquidity and Capital Resources), net of the impact of stock option exercises. Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, of $10.8 million and $10.7 million, represents the income of AndersonBrecon in both fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with Year ended September 30, 2010 Revenue Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Change Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 79,753,118 $ 77,552,936 2.8% Other 302,012 261,705 15.4% Intersegment eliminations (51,286 ) (38,181 ) 34.3% Revenue $ 80,003,844 $ 77,776,460 2.9% Revenue of $80.0 billion in fiscal 2011 increased 2.9% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in revenue was due to the 5% growth of ABDC, offset in part by the 3% revenue decline of ABSG. Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment ABDCs revenue increased 5% from fiscal 2010 due to overall pharmaceutical market growth, and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers, primarily our institutional customers. ABSGs revenue of $15.5 billion in fiscal 2011 decreased by 3% from fiscal 2010 primarily due to the September 2010 discontinuance of its contract with a third party logistics customer that transitioned to a direct manufacturer distribution model. ABSGs revenue decline in fiscal 2011 was also attributable to a decline in sales to dialysis providers, and a shift in product mix to more generic pharmaceuticals. During both fiscal 2011 and 2010, 70% of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 30% was from sales to retail customers. Sales to institutional customers increased 4% in fiscal 2011 and sales to retail customers increased 1% in fiscal 2011. Other Other revenue increased $40.3 million from fiscal 2010 primarily due to the strong performance of the Lash Group, which provides commercialization support services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers. Gross Profit Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Change Gross profit $ 2,501,595 $ 2,325,050 7.6% Gross profit of $2.5 billion in fiscal 2011 increased $176.5 million or 7.6% from fiscal 2010. This increase was greater than our revenue growth in large part due to the impact of certain specialty generic product introductions (launches), the continued strong growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs and increased contributions from our fee for service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. All of the above was offset, in part, by normal competitive pressures on customer margins. Oxaliplatin, Gemcitabine, and Docetaxel (all generic oncology drugs) were launched in the quarters ended September 30, 2009, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, respectively. The gross profit benefit achieved collectively from all three generic oncology drugs in fiscal 2011 was higher than the benefit achieved from Oxaliplatin alone in fiscal 2010 by approximately $96 million. Sales of Oxaliplatin, the largest contributor of the three specialty generic drugs, benefited our gross profit by approximately $106 million and $117 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Beginning in our fourth quarter ended September 30, 2011, the gross profit contributions from the sales Gemcitabine and Docetaxel began to moderate as additional pharmaceutical manufacturers offered these products for sale and as third party reimbursement rates to our customers declined. In fiscal 2011, we recognized a gain of $2.1 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. This compared to a recognized gain of $20.7 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in fiscal 2010. These gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold. Lastly, in fiscal 2010, we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us. Our gross profit benefited by approximately $12 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of having completed this reconciliation. As a percentage of revenue, our gross profit margin of 3.13% in fiscal 2011 improved by 14 basis points from fiscal 2010 due to the above mentioned generic oncology drug launches, the strong growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs and increased contributions from fee for service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. These factors more than offset the above market growth of some of our largest customers, who benefit from our best pricing, and normal competitive pressures on customer margins. Additionally, the gain on antitrust litigation settlements, as noted above, contributed 3 basis points to our gross margin in fiscal 2010. We recorded a LIFO charge of $34.7 million and $30.2 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. 24 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Change Distribution, selling and administrative $ 1,179,234 $ 1,150,833 2.5% Depreciation and amortization 105,482 83,572 26.2% Employee severance, litigation and other 23,567 (4,482 ) Intangible asset impairments 6,506 3,200 103.3% Total operating expenses $ 1,314,789 $ 1,233,123 6.6% In fiscal 2011, we started to incur significant costs to support our new ERP system as we began the transition of our legacy information systems to our new ERP system. Additionally, in fiscal 2011, ABDC implemented its Energiz program, which encompasses a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity, improve customer contractual compliance, and drive efficiency by linking our information technology capabilities more effectively with our operations. Distribution, selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 increased 2.5% due to incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms and an increase in consulting expenses related to ABDCs Energiz program. In fiscal 2010, asset impairment charges included a write off of capitalized software of $6.7 million, which was included within distribution, selling and administrative expenses. Depreciation expense increased from fiscal 2010 primarily due to the implementation of our new ERP system. Employee severance, litigation and other in fiscal 2011 included $4.4 million related to our Energiz program, a $16.0 million charge related to the preliminary Qui Tam settlement (the Qui Tam Matter as described in Note 12 "Legal Matters and Contingencies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and $3.2 million of costs related to business acquisitions. Fiscal 2010 benefited from the reversal of a $4.4 million legal accrual. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 1.64% in fiscal 2011, an increase of 5 basis points from fiscal 2010. This increase was due to the same matters as noted above and was offset, in part, by our operating leverage, particularly within ABDC. Operating Income Fiscal year ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Change Pharmaceutical Distribution $ 1,181,959 $ 1,051,292 12.4% Other 28,414 36,153 21.4% Employee severance, litigation and other (23,567 ) 4,482 Operating income $ 1,186,806 $ 1,091,927 8.7% Segment operating income is evaluated before employee severance, litigation and other. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income increased $130.7 million from fiscal 2010 due to the increase in its gross profit, offset, in part, by an increase in its operating expenses. Other operating income in fiscal 2011 decreased $7.7 million primarily due to a $6.5 million intangible asset impairment charge. The net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements, the costs relating to employee severance, litigation and other, and the asset impairments decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 4 basis points in fiscal 2011 and increased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 3 basis points in fiscal 2010. Interest expense, interest income, and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in thousands): 2011 2010 Amount Weighted Average Interest Rate Amount Weighted Average Interest Rate Interest expense $ 78,870 5.31% $ 74,704 5.19% Interest income (2,181 ) 0.19% (2,311 ) 0.21% Interest expense, net $ 76,689 $ 72,393 25  Table of Contents Interest expense in fiscal 2011 increased from fiscal 2010 due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate and a decline in interest costs capitalized relating to our Business Transformation project. Interest costs capitalized had the effect of reducing interest expense and were $3.4 million and $6.6 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest income decreased from fiscal 2010 primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate and an increase in the amount of cash held in non interest bearing cash accounts. Income taxes in fiscal 2011 reflect an effective income tax rate of 37.6%, compared to 38.0% in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to adjustments made relating to state deferred income taxes. Income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 increased 11% from fiscal 2010 primarily due to the increase in operating income. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.51 in fiscal 2011 increased 15% from $2.19 in fiscal 2010. The difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the 3% reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding, primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase programs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources), net of the impact of stock option exercises. Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, represented the income from AndersonBrecon in both fiscal 2011 and 2010. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For a complete list of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, and our customers financial strength, credit standing, and payment and default history. Changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. Each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise. We write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote. Each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly. There were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. The bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts, net of write offs, recoveries and other adjustments. Schedule II of this Form 10 K sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $25.5 million, $39.2 million, and $43.1 million respectively. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2012 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately $4.0 million. Supplier Reserves We establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us. We evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2012 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately $9.6 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate. Loss Contingencies An estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of our accruals and related disclosures. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates. Merchandise Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 79% and 81% of our inventories at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, has been determined using the last in, first out ("LIFO") method. If we had used the first in, first out ("FIFO") method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $256.7 million and $256.0 million higher than the amounts reported at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We recorded a LIFO charge of $0.7 million, $34.7 million, and $30.2 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 respectively. 26 Table of Contents Business Combinations The purchase price of an acquired company, including the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. We engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual events. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired entity over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships, software technology and non compete agreements are amortized over their estimated useful lives. In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, a determination of the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based, among other things, on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit and or the component of the entity being valued. We are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value ("impairment indicators"). This impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows, analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management. We completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, and, as a result, recorded $6.5 million, and $2.5 million of impairment charges in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to the business model, or changes in operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results. Share Based Compensation We utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based compensation expense, which involves the use of several assumptions, including expected term of the option, expected volatility, risk free interest rate, dividend yield, and forfeiture rate. The expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors, such as implied volatility. Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually. After application of the valuation allowances described above, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. However, others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued. 27 Table of Contents The significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year. If any of our assumptions or estimates were to change, an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by $11.6 million in fiscal 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table illustrates our debt structure at September 30, 2012, including availability under the multi currency revolving credit facility and the receivables securitization facility (in thousands): Outstanding Balance Additional Availability Fixed Rate Debt: $500,000, 57/8% senior notes due 2015 $ 499,091 $ $400,000, 47/8% senior notes due 2019 397,485 $500,000, 31/2% senior notes due 2021 499,355 Total fixed rate debt 1,395,931 Variable Rate Debt: Multi currency revolving credit facility due 2017 50,839 638,314 Receivables securitization facility due 2015 700,000 Other 1,617 Total variable rate debt 50,839 1,339,931 Total debt, including current portion $ 1,446,770 $ 1,339,931 Along with our cash balances, our aggregate availability under our multi currency revolving credit facility and our receivables securitization facility provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements. In February 2012, we repaid the borrowings under the $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility, which was terminated. In September 2012, we repaid the borrowings under the $392.3 million 55/8% senior notes due September 15, 2012. In November 2011, we issued $500 million of 31/2% senior notes due November 15, 2021 (the "2021 Notes"). The 2021 Notes were sold at 99.858% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 3.52%. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semiannually, in arrears, commencing May 15, 2012. The 2021 Notes rank pari passu to the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility, the 2015 Notes, and the 2019 Notes (all defined below). We used the net proceeds of the 2021 Notes for general corporate purposes. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes were deferred and are being amortized over the ten year term of the notes. We have a $700 million multi currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in March 2015, (the "Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility") with a syndicate of lenders. In October 2011, we entered into an amendment with the syndicate of lenders to extend the maturity date of the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility to October 2016. The amendment also reduced our borrowing rates and facility fees. In November 2012, we further extended the maturity date to November 2017. Interest on borrowings under the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 68 basis points to 155 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (90 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee at September 30, 2012). Additionally, interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on our debt rating, ranging from 7 basis points to 20 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (10 basis points at September 30, 2012). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales, which we are compliant with as of September 30, 2012. On October 31, 2011, we established a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $700 million at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at September 30, 2012. We have a $700 million receivables securitization facility ("Receivables Securitization Facility"), which was scheduled to expire in April 2014. In October 2011, we entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Facility to extend the maturity date to October 2014. The amendment also reduced our borrowing rates. In November 2012, we further extended the maturity date to November 2015. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are currently based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper or LIBOR plus a program fee of 75 basis points. We currently pay an unused fee of 37.5 basis points, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. At September 30, 2012, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility. 28 Table of Contents In connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, ABDC sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, a wholly owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. ABDC is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. After the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. We use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. We have $500 million of 57/8% senior notes due September 15, 2015 (the "2015 Notes"), and $400 million of 47/8% senior notes due November 15, 2019 (the "2019 Notes"). The 2015 Notes were sold at 99.5% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 5.94%. The 2019 Notes were sold in November 2009 at 99.174% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 4.98%. Interest on the 2015 Notes, and the 2019 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears. All of the senior notes rank pari passu to the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility. All of the senior notes and the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility were previously guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of the Companys subsidiaries, which were known as the guarantor subsidiaries. On June 29, 2012, in accordance with the terms of the documents governing the underlying obligations, each of the guarantor subsidiaries was released from its obligations under its guarantee of the senior notes and the Multi Currency Revolving Credit Facility. Our operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and repurchases of shares of our common stock. Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. In August 2011, our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2012, we purchased $500.0 million of our common stock to complete our availability remaining on this $750 million share repurchase program. Additionally, we paid $8.0 million in October 2011 to settle purchases of our common stock made on September 29, 2011. On May 10, 2012, our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2012, we purchased $653.1 million of our common stock under this $750 million share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2012, we had $96.9 million of availability remaining on the $750 million share repurchase program. On November 1, 2012, our board of directors approved a new program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. We currently expect to purchase at least $200 million of our common stock in fiscal 2013, subject to market conditions. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements. Deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. In addition, volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations. Following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at September 30, 2012 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Within 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Debt, including interest payments $ 1,856,061 $ 67,503 $ 635,006 $ 126,052 $ 1,027,500 Operating leases 319,560 56,671 98,693 68,486 95,710 Other commitments 211,607 110,663 100,105 839 Total $ 2,387,228 $ 234,837 $ 833,804 $ 195,377 $ 1,123,210 We have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through the 2014/2015 flu season. We are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices. We currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately $76.4 million as of September 30, 2012, of which $38.7 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2013. These influenza vaccine commitments are included in "Other commitments" in the above table. We have commitments to purchase blood plasma products from suppliers through December 31, 2012. We are required to purchase quantities at prices that we believe will represent market prices. We currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately $24.8 million as of September 30, 2012. These commitments are included in "Other commitments" in the above table. We have outsourced to IBM Global Services ("IBM") a significant portion of our corporate and ABDC information technology activities, including assistance with the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system. The remaining commitment under our 10 year arrangement, as amended, which expires in June 2015, is approximately $89.2 million as of September 30, 2012, of which $35.1 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2013, and is included in "Other commitments" in the above table. 29 Table of Contents Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $43.3 million (including interest and penalties) as of September 30, 2012. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table. During fiscal 2012, our operating activities provided $1,305.4 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of $1,167.9 million in the prior fiscal year. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2012 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of $708.2 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of $420.6 million and non cash items of $261.0 million, offset, in part, by an increase in merchandise inventories of $200.1 million. Non cash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of $60.6 million, which represented a $133.3 million decline from the prior fiscal year. Deferred income taxes were significantly higher in the prior year period due to the larger income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories and tax bonus depreciation resulting from our Business Transformation capital expenditures. The $420.6 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases made and the related payments to our suppliers. Merchandise inventories increased $200.1 million from the September 30, 2011 balance due to the timing of inventory purchases. We use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. We expect our days sales outstanding in fiscal 2013 to increase slightly as the payment terms in our new three year contract with Express Scripts are longer than the payment terms in the previous Medco contract. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 2011 2010 Days sales outstanding 18.3 17.2 17.2 Days inventory on hand 26.2 24.5 25.0 Days payable outstanding 42.8 39.4 39.8 Our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital. Operating cash uses during fiscal 2012 included $84.5 million of interest payments and $302.1 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. During fiscal 2011, our operating activities provided $1,167.9 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of $1,108.6 million in fiscal 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of $695.9 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of $403.7 million, and non cash items of $377.3 million, offset, in part, by an increase in merchandise inventories of $267.6 million. Non cash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of $194.0 million, which represents an increase of $109.5 million from fiscal 2010 and is primarily attributable to income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories and tax bonus depreciation resulting from our Business Transformation capital expenditures. Our inventory and accounts payable balances at September 30, 2011 were 5% and 4% higher, respectively, than those balances at September 30, 2010. These increases were largely attributable to the growth in our business in fiscal 2011. Despite the 3% increase in revenue in fiscal 2011, accounts receivable at September 30, 2011 was relatively flat when compared to the balance at September 30, 2010. This was primarily due to timing of customer payments to us. Operating cash uses during fiscal 2011 included $74.2 million of interest payments and $214.6 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 were $164.0 million, $157.7 million, and $176.5 million, respectively. We currently expect to spend approximately $180 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2013. Our most significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 related principally to our Business Transformation project, which includes a new ERP system for our corporate office and for our ABDC operations. Significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 also included investments to expand our infrastructure in Canada, and other ABDC and ABCS facility expansions and improvements. Other capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 and 2011 included ABDC purchases of machinery and equipment, which were previously sold to financial institutions and leased back by us, and other technology initiatives. Other capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 included various enhancements made to our other business units information and customer related technology systems. In April 2012, we acquired World Courier for a purchase price of $518.0 million, net of a working capital adjustment. In November 2011, we acquired TheraCom for a purchase price of $257.2 million, net of a working capital adjustment. Additionally, we finalized working capital adjustments relating to our September 2011 acquisitions of IntrinsiQ, LLC ("IntrinsiQ") and Premier Source ("Premier"), totaling $0.5 million, net. In September 2011, we acquired IntrinsiQ for a purchase price of $34.3 million, net of a working capital adjustment. Additionally, in September 2011, we acquired Premier for a purchase price of $11.1 million, net of cash acquired. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2012 included net borrowings of $21.6 million under our revolving and securitization credit facilities. It also included $499.3 million of proceeds received related to the November 2011 issuance of our 2021 Notes and the repayments of $392.3 million of senior notes due September 15, 2012 and $55 million due under our Blanco revolving credit facility. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 included net borrowings of $22.4 million under our revolving and securitization credit facilities. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2010 included $396.7 million of proceeds received related to the November 2009 issuance of our 2019 Notes and net repayments of $210.4 million under our revolving and securitization credit facilities. Additionally, $7.7 million of discretionary long term debt repayments were made in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, we purchased a total of $1,162.2 million, $840.6 million, and $470.4 million, respectively, of our common stock in connection with our share repurchase programs, which are summarized below. 30 Table of Contents In November 2008, our board of directors authorized a program allowing the purchase of up to $500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2009, we purchased $431.9 million under this program and during fiscal 2010, we purchased $68.1 million to complete the program. In November 2009, our board of directors authorized a program allowing us to purchase up to $500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2010, we purchased $401.9 million under this program and during fiscal 2011, we purchased $98.1 million to complete the program. In September 2010, our board of directors authorized a program allowing us to purchase up to $500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions, all of which was purchased during fiscal 2011. In August 2011, our board of directors authorized a program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2011, we purchased $250.0 million under this program, of which $8.0 million was cash settled in October 2011. During fiscal 2012, we purchased $500.0 million to complete the program. In May 2012, our board of directors authorized a new program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. Through June 30, 2012, we purchased 0.2 million shares in the open market for a total of $5.9 million. In addition, on August 13, 2012, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase ("ASR") transaction with a financial institution and paid $648.0 million for an initial delivery of 16.8 million shares. The number of shares ultimately purchased was based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the ASR. The ASR transaction was settled on October 9, 2012, at which time we received 0.1 million incremental shares. In November 2009, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 33% from $0.06 per share to $0.08 per share. During fiscal 2010, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.08 per share. In November 2010, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 25% from $0.08 per share to $0.10 per share. In May 2011, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 15% from $0.10 per share to $0.115 per share. In November 2011, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 13% from $0.115 per share to $0.13 per share. In November 2012, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend again by 62% from $0.13 per share to $0.21 per share. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Market Risk Our most significant market risk historically has been the effect of fluctuations in interest rates relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. At September 30, 2012, we had $50.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect at September 30, 2012. We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2012, of which $230.0 million was invested in money market accounts at financial institutions. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable rate debt, a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million. We are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the Canadian Dollar, the U.K. Pound Sterling, and the Euro. We may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. Such contracts generally have durations of less than one year. We had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at September 30, 2012. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011 05, "Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income." ASU No. 2011 05 requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate, but consecutive statements. ASU No. 2011 05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating our presentation options under ASU No. 2011 05; however, we do not expect adoption of this guidance to impact our consolidated financial statements other than the change in presentation. We intend to adopt this ASU in our quarter ending December 31, 2012. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 08, "Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment." Under ASU No. 2011 08, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the entity determines that this threshold is not met, then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary. ASU No. 2011 08 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2011, and early adoption is permitted. We intend to adopt this ASU in our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2012. 31 Table of Contents In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012 02, "Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment." ASU No. 2012 02 simplifies how an entity tests indefinite lived intangible assets (other than goodwill) for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. An entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment, while no further analysis would be required if it passes. ASU No. 2012 02 is effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, and early adoption is permitted. We intend to adopt this ASU in our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2012. Forward Looking Statements Certain of the statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") and elsewhere in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change in circumstances.
