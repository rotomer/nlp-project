ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by segment for the last three years: Components of Change % Total % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2001 vs. 2000 18.5 0.7 20.1 (2.3 ) 2000 vs. 1999 4.3 (0.3 ) 6.6 (2.0 ) 1999 vs. 1998 5.3 (0.1 ) 6.1 (0.7 ) Total U.S. 2001 vs. 2000 17.2 0.7 16.5 2000 vs. 1999 6.1 (0.7 ) 6.8 1999 vs. 1998 4.8 (0.5 ) 5.3 Total International 2001 vs. 2000 20.7 0.6 26.1 (6.0 ) 2000 vs. 1999 1.5 0.4 6.3 (5.2 ) 1999 vs. 1998 6.1 0.6 7.4 (1.9 ) Pharmaceutical Products Segment (a) 2001 vs. 2000 45.7 2.8 42.9 2000 vs. 1999 7.6 (2.5 ) 10.1 1999 vs. 1998 2.7 2.7 Diagnostic Products Segment 2001 vs. 2000 0.2 (0.2 ) 4.2 (3.8 ) 2000 vs. 1999 (2.9 ) 0.7 (3.6 ) 1999 vs. 1998 8.9 (1.2 ) 10.7 (0.6 ) Hospital Products Segment 2001 vs. 2000 10.8 (1.2 ) 12.0 2000 vs. 1999 11.5 (1.7 ) 13.2 1999 vs. 1998 2.7 (1.5 ) 4.2 Ross Products Segment 2001 vs. 2000 2.6 2.1 0.5 2000 vs. 1999 4.0 1.6 2.4 1999 vs. 1998 6.0 0.9 5.1 International Segment (a) 2001 vs. 2000 33.6 0.4 39.2 (6.0 ) 2000 vs. 1999 3.2 0.9 7.1 (4.8 ) 1999 vs. 1998 6.8 1.8 7.4 (2.4 ) (a)In 2001, Pharmaceutical and International segment sales were favorably impacted by the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. 23 Sales of new products in 2001 are estimated to be $939 million, excluding the effect of the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Increases, as disclosed in Note 14, in adult nutritionals in all three years and in anti infectives in 1999 were primarily due to unit increases. The decreases in anti infectives for 2001 and 2000 were due primarily to unit decreases. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins (sales less cost of products sold, including distribution expenses) were 52.4 percent of net sales in 2001 and 54.6 percent in 2000 and 1999. The decrease in the gross profit margin in 2001 was due primarily to increased goodwill and intangibles amortization as a result of the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF and one time integration charges, partially offset by favorable product mix. Gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements, partially offset by the negative effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar, higher project expenses for new products, higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth, and the effects of inflation and competitive pricing pressures. In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. There are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products. These rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the Ross and Pharmaceutical segments. As a result of the consent decree entered into with the U.S. government in 1999, as discussed in Note 17, Abbott is prohibited from manufacturing or distributing certain diagnostic products until Abbott ensures the processes in its Lake County, Ill., diagnostics manufacturing operations conform with the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Quality System Regulation (QSR). Under the terms of the amended consent decree, Abbott must ensure its diagnostics manufacturing operations are in conformance with the QSR by various dates through January 15, 2001. The FDA will determine Abbotts conformance with the QSR after an inspection of Abbotts facilities in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002. If the FDA concludes that the operations are not in conformance with the QSR, Abbott may be subject to additional costs. The FDA announced in 1997 that all manufacturers of levothyroxine drug products (Synthroid), most of which had been on the market for many years, would be required as part of the agencys regulatory process to file either a New Drug Application (NDA), or a citizen petition showing that their products are not new drugs and therefore do not require an NDA. Synthroids manufacturer at the time, Knoll Pharmaceutical Company, which Abbott acquired in March 2001, exercised the citizen petition option because of Synthroids long history and excellent track record. On April 26, 2001, the FDA denied Knolls petition. Abbott promptly responded to the FDA that Abbott would submit an NDA for Synthroid, which Abbott submitted on August 1, 2001. Abbott expects that the NDA review process will take approximately 10 to 12 months from the date the FDA filed the NDA. On July 11, 2001, the FDA published guidance on the distribution of levothyroxine sodium products during the NDA review process. The guidance allows Synthroid to remain on the market while the agency reviews the NDA Abbott has submitted for Synthroid. However, the guidance also requires that levothyroxine sodium products without approved NDAs are subject to gradually reducing quarterly limits on distribution as measured against the average monthly distribution during the six months ended August 1, 2001. By August 14, 2003, all levothyroxine sodium products without approved NDAs would be required to cease distribution. Upon NDA approval, the limits on distribution will be removed. In 2001, Abbott recorded U.S. net sales of Synthroid of $445 million. Research and development expense was $1.6 billion in 2001 and represented 9.7 percent of net sales, compared to 9.8 percent of net sales in 2000, and 9.1 percent of net sales in 1999. The increase in research and development expenses in 2001 was concentrated primarily on pharmaceutical products. Research and development expenditures continue to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 29.0 percent in 2001, net of the favorable effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar of 2.4 percent, compared to increases of 1.3 percent in 2000, and 24 3.5 percent in 1999. The increase in selling, general and administration in 2001 was due primarily to the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. The increases, net of exchange, in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the International, Pharmaceutical and Hospital segments. Abbotts income from TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) Joint Venture was adversely affected in 2001 and 2000 as a result of the settlement of the U.S. Department of Justice investigation of TAPs marketing of Lupron, as discussed in Note 16. Interest (Income) Expense, Net Net interest expense increased in 2001 primarily due to a higher level of borrowings as a result of the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Net interest expense decreased in 2000 and 1999 due to a lower level of borrowings and a higher level of investment securities. Taxes on Earnings The effective income tax rates were 17.7 percent in 2001, 27.0 percent in 2000, and 28.0 percent in 1999. The 2001 tax rate is lower than the 2000 tax rate due primarily to the effect of the benefit of tax exemptions in several taxing jurisdictions in relation to Abbotts decreased pretax income in 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the effects of the acquisitions of the pharmaceutical business of BASF and Vysis, Inc., the effective tax rate for 2001 would have been approximately 26 percent. The 2000 tax rate was lower than the 1999 tax rate due, in part, to the domestic dividend exclusion applicable to the increased earnings of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. Earnings Abbott recorded certain nonrecurring charges to earnings in 2001 primarily related to the acquisitions of the pharmaceutical business of BASF and of Vysis, Inc. and other items. Managements analysis of these nonrecurring items compared to reported net income and diluted earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) is as follows: Description Amount (in millions, except per share amounts) Acquired in process research and development $ 1,330 TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture income adjustment relating to Lupron marketing settlements 289 Acquisition related charges other than acquired in process research and development 262 Equity impairments and other charges 102 Total pretax nonrecurring charges 1,983 Taxes on nonrecurring charges 590 Net income effect of nonrecurring charges 1,393 Net income as reported (GAAP) 1,550 Net income excluding nonrecurring charges $ 2,943 Diluted earnings per share effect of nonrecurring charges $ 0.89 Diluted earnings per share as reported (GAAP) 0.99 Diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring charges $ 1.88 25 Financial Condition Cash Flow Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to approximate or exceed Abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends. Abbott does not have material exposures to off balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, or activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2001, Abbotts bond ratings were AA by Standard & Poors Corporation and Aa3 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of $3.0 billion, which support domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements. As a result of the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF, Abbotts credit ratings were adjusted to reflect the increased borrowings that financed the acquisition. Under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2001, Abbott issued $3.250 billion of long term debt securities. Proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce short term commercial paper borrowings, which were primarily used to finance the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Under the registration statement, Abbott may issue $250 million in the future in the form of debt securities or common shares without par value. Working Capital At December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, working capital was $492 million, $3.1 billion, and $1.9 billion, respectively. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.2 billion in 2001, $1.0 billion in 2000, and $987 million in 1999 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments and hospital equipment placed with customers. This level of capital expenditures is expected to continue, with an increased proportion dedicated to the Hospital, International and Diagnostic segments. Legislative Issues Abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation. Abbott expects debate to continue at both the federal and state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. If legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing the rate of price increases, for medical products and services. International operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. Business Combinations and Divestiture On March 2, 2001, Abbott acquired, for cash, the pharmaceutical business of BASF, which includes the global operations of Knoll Pharmaceuticals, for approximately $7.2 billion. This acquisition was 26 financed primarily with short and long term borrowings. The acquisition is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The allocation of the acquisition cost is as follows (in billions of dollars): Acquired intangible assets, primarily product rights for currently marketed products $ 3.5 Goodwill 2.4 Acquired in process research and development 1.2 Deferred income taxes resulting primarily from nondeductible intangibles (0.4 ) Acquired net tangible assets 0.5 Total allocation of acquisition cost $ 7.2 The acquisition cost has been allocated to intangible assets, goodwill, acquired in process research and development, and net tangible assets based on an independent appraisal of fair values as of the date of acquisition. Product rights for currently marketed products will be amortized on a straight line basis over 10 to 16 years (average 13 years), and goodwill was amortized in 2001 on a straight line basis over 20 years. Acquired in process research and development was charged to expense in 2001. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of property and equipment of approximately $630 million, trade accounts receivable of approximately $402 million, and inventories of approximately $275 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable and other liabilities. Prior to the date of acquisition, Abbott began to plan for the integration and restructuring of the business. In 2001, Abbott formally approved several restructuring plans and is continuing to assess and formulate further restructuring plans for specific business activities. Certain costs of implementing formally approved plans have been included in the reported amount of goodwill above. Abbott expects that additional restructuring plans will be finalized and formally approved, which will increase the amount of reported goodwill above. In addition, integration of the acquired operations will result in charges that will be recorded against earnings in the periods in which the integration plans are finalized. The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Abbott as if the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF had taken place on January 1, 2000. The pro forma information includes primarily adjustments for acquired in process research and development, amortization of product rights for currently marketed products, interest expense for estimated acquisition debt, and amortization of goodwill. The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations as it would have been had the transaction been effected on the assumed date. 2001 Pro Forma 2000 Pro Forma (in billions, except per share amounts) Net sales $ 16.7 $ 16.1 Net income 2.3 2.5 Diluted earnings per common share 1.46 1.62 In November 2001, Abbott acquired, for cash, all of the outstanding common stock of Vysis, Inc., a leading genomic disease management company. Of the cash acquisition cost of approximately $362 million, $162 million was allocated to developed technology, which will be amortized over 15 years, and $143 million was charged against earnings in 2001 for acquired in process research and development. The remaining acquisition cost was allocated to net tangible assets and goodwill. Had this acquisition taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. 27 In 2000, Abbott sold its agricultural products business to Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., resulting in a $138 million gain. Restructuring Plans (in millions of dollars) In 2001, Abbott began implementing restructuring plans related to the operations of the acquired pharmaceutical business of BASF. In addition, Abbott announced in 2001 that it was closing one of its manufacturing operations and relocating production to other Abbott facilities. The following summarizes the restructuring activity: Employee Related and Other Asset Impairments Total Restructuring charges $ 195.5 $ 11.5 $ 207.0 Payments and other activity (106.7 ) (11.5 ) (118.2 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2001 $ 88.8 $ $ 88.8 Of the $207.0 total restructuring charges, $155.5 has been recorded as goodwill associated with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Of the amount expensed, approximately $35.8 is classified as cost of products sold, $13.3 as selling, general and administrative, and $2.4 as research and development. Employee related costs are primarily severance pay, relocation of former BASF employees and outplacement services. Approved restructuring plans cover 2,393 employees, of which approximately 1,200 were severed by year end. Employee groups covered under the restructuring plans include manufacturing, research and development, and sales and administrative related functions. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. With the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization over its estimated useful life. Goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair value based test, beginning on the date of adoption of the new standard. Abbott is assessing the potential impact, if any, that may be caused by the assessment of impairment requirements of SFAS No. 142. Abbott estimates that annual goodwill amortization in 2001 subject to the new rule would have been approximately $80 million to $100 million on an after tax basis. In addition, in 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," and No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Adoption of the provisions of these statements will not have a material effect on the financial statements of Abbott. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbotts operations are discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 28  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management (Unaudited) Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments In 2001, Abbott entered into interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.450 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of $2.450 billion of long term debt due in July 2004 and 2006. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. As of December 31, 2001, and 2000, Abbott had $2.9 billion and $185 million, respectively, of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average interest rate of 1.8% and 6.5%, respectively, and with an average remaining life of 14 days and three days, respectively. The fair market value of long term debt at December 31, 2001, and 2000, amounted to $4.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and consisted primarily of fixed rate (average of 5.5% and 6.1%, respectively) debt with maturities through 2023. As of December 31, 2001, and 2000, the fair market value of current and long term investment securities maturing through 2023 amounted to $345 million and $571 million, respectively. Approximately 13 percent and 10 percent of these investments as of December 31, 2001, and 2000, respectively, have fixed interest rates (average of 7.4% and 6.9%, respectively), while the remaining investments have variable rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or market values. (A 100 basis point change is a reasonably possible near term change in rates.) Market Price Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott maintains a portfolio of available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions. The market value of these investments was approximately $262 million and $215 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2001, and 2000. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease the fair value by approximately $52 million. (A 20 percent decrease is a reasonably possible near term change in share prices.) Non Exchange Traded Equity Secruities Abbott maintains a portfolio of equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $81 million and $75 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2001, and 2000. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in estimated value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked to market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2001, and 2000, Abbott held $3.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the next calendar year. In addition, certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in the foreign exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss. Gains or losses will be included in cost of sales at the time the products are 29 sold, generally through the end of 2002. At December 31, 2001, Abbott held $571 million of such contracts, which all mature in the next calendar year. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001, and 2000: 2001 2000 Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value (dollars in millions) Receive primarily U.S. Dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 2,381 0.91 $ (21.9 ) $ 318 0.87 $ 1.6 British Pound 752 0.71 (4.5 ) 269 0.67 13.0 Japanese Yen 208 120.4 2.8 212 106.5 5.3 All other currencies 352 N/A 0.9 472 N/A 1.4 Total $ 3,693 $ (22.7 ) $ 1,271 $ 21.3 30
