ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Critical Accounting Policies Litigation Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." Under SFAS No. 5, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period, as additional information is known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. As noted below, Abbott is unable to estimate a loss, if any, for the industry wide enteral nutritional business investigation. Sales Rebates A large part of Abbotts domestic businesses sell products to distributors who resell the products to the end customers. Abbott must provide rebates to members of buying groups who purchase from Abbotts distributors, to distributors that sell to their customers at prices determined under a contract between Abbott and the customer, or to state agencies, which administer various programs such as the federal Medicaid and Medicare programs and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases or by reference to a specific price for a product. Therefore, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of revenue when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to 24 months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Income Taxes Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items are often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. The company employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. As part of Abbotts calculation of the provision for taxes on earnings, Abbott records the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service is currently auditing Abbotts U.S. income tax returns for the years 1993 through 1995. Pension and Post Employment Benefits Abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations under these programs. With the assistance of outside actuaries, Abbott must develop long term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate, discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a five year period. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for decades, can be significant in relation to the obligation and the annual expense recorded for these programs. Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point. In 2002, Abbott recorded minimum pension liability adjustments of $343 million because the accumulated benefit obligations for certain domestic and international defined benefit plans exceeded the market value of the plans assets. This resulted in a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $203 million, net of taxes. The discount rate used in 2002 for determining the 24 accumulated benefit obligations was 6.75%. A one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in an increase in the minimum pension liability adjustments of approximately $368 million. Valuation of Intangible Assets Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott values and records. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Generally, transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field, and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets acquired and for the assessment of impairment. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbotts critical assumptions for significant acquisitions of intangibles. Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to the discounted cash flow value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment to goodwill occurs. 25 Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by segment for the last three years: Components of Change % Total % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2002 vs. 2001 8.6 1.0 8.2 (0.6 ) 2001 vs. 2000 18.5 0.7 20.1 (2.3 ) 2000 vs. 1999 4.3 (0.3 ) 6.6 (2.0 ) Total U.S. 2002 vs. 2001 7.4 1.0 6.4 2001 vs. 2000 17.2 0.7 16.5 2000 vs. 1999 6.1 (0.7 ) 6.8 Total International 2002 vs. 2001 10.6 1.0 11.1 (1.5 ) 2001 vs. 2000 20.7 0.6 26.1 (6.0 ) 2000 vs. 1999 1.5 0.4 6.3 (5.2 ) Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2002 vs. 2001 13.5 4.7 8.8 2001 vs. 2000 (a) 45.7 2.8 42.9 2000 vs. 1999 7.6 (2.5 ) 10.1 Diagnostic Products Segment 2002 vs. 2001 (1.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.6 ) (0.4 ) 2001 vs. 2000 0.2 (0.2 ) 4.2 (3.8 ) 2000 vs. 1999 (2.9 ) 0.7 (3.6 ) Hospital Products Segment 2002 vs. 2001 7.2 (0.6 ) 7.8 2001 vs. 2000 10.8 (1.2 ) 12.0 2000 vs. 1999 11.5 (1.7 ) 13.2 Ross Products Segment 2002 vs. 2001 (2.2 ) 2.2 2001 vs. 2000 2.6 2.1 0.5 2000 vs. 1999 4.0 1.6 2.4 International Segment 2002 vs. 2001 14.0 1.3 14.6 (1.9 ) 2001 vs. 2000 (a) 33.6 0.4 39.2 (6.0 ) 2000 vs. 1999 3.2 0.9 7.1 (4.8 ) (a)In 2001, Pharmaceutical and International segment sales were favorably impacted compared to 2000 by the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. 26 A comparison of the product group sales by segment is as follows (dollars in millions): 2002 Percent Change 2001 Percent Change 2000 Percent Change Pharmaceutical Products Neuroscience $ 861 (1 ) $ 869 12 $ 776 14 Anti Infectives 805 4 777 (14 ) 904 3 Diabetes/Metabolism 564 7 529 N/A N/A Cardiology/Urology 473 52 310 105 151 103 Anti Viral 380 27 298 109 143 45 Diagnostic Products Immunochemistry 2,030 (2 ) 2,068 (3 ) 2,132 (7 ) Glucose 494 8 455 5 435 16 Hematology 212 (4 ) 220 3 213 4 Hospital Products Anesthesia 428 6 403 9 369 26 Renal Care 364 19 305 25 244 29 Acute Care Injectibles 466 4 448 12 401 Infusion Therapy 428 6 403 9 371 Vascular Pharma and Devices 205 33 154 34 114 8 Ross Products Pediatric Nutritionals 1,003 (4 ) 1,041 1,042 7 Adult Nutritionals 838 1 833 4 802 2 International Other Pharmaceuticals 2,287 31 1,742 152 692 5 Anti Infectives 696 (2 ) 708 (8 ) 770 (6 ) Hospital Products 785 3 759 (2 ) 775 4 Pediatric Nutritionals 486 1 480 9 443 8 Adult Nutritionals 528 4 508 507 7 Sales of new products in 2002 are estimated to be $531 million, led by the Ross Products and International segments. In 2001, the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF favorably impacted the Diabetes/Metabolism and Cardiology/Urology product sales of the Pharmaceutical Products segment and the Other Pharmaceuticals product sales of the International segment. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in Note 1. Gains recorded in net sales were $164 million in 2002, $44 million in 2001 and $98 million in 2000. On December 31, 2002, the FDA approved Humira for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Worldwide sales of Humira are forecasted to be more than $150 million in 2003. The expiration of patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. Significant patent expirations and activities in the next three years are as follows. The original U.S. compound patent on clarithromycin expires in 2005. Approximately 50% of the U.S. sales of clarithromycin in 2002 were made under a form covered by patents that expire later than 2005. U.S. sales of clarithromycin were $487 million in 2002. Abbott markets TriCor in the U.S. under a license agreement. Patents covering TriCor are being challenged by competitors. Abbott is vigorously defending the patents. U.S. sales of TriCor were $403 million in 2002. An NDA for Synthroid, which is not protected by a patent, was approved by the FDA in 2002. The FDA is 27 studying the conditions under which competitors may rely on Abbotts NDA to market a competitive product. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $489 million in 2002. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins (sales less cost of products sold, including distribution expenses) were 51.9 percent of net sales in 2002, 52.4 percent in 2001 and 54.6 percent in 2000. The gross profit margin for 2002 was negatively impacted by the FDA consent decree charge, restructuring charges, both as discussed below, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by absence of goodwill amortization in 2002. The decrease in the gross profit margin in 2001 was due primarily to increased goodwill and intangibles amortization and integration charges as a result of the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements, higher project expenses for new products, higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth, and the effects of inflation and competitive pricing pressures. In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. There are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products. These rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the Ross and Pharmaceutical Products segments. In addition, the gross profit margins for the Ross segment were negatively impacted due to pricing pressure and unfavorable product mix. The gross profit margins for the Pharmaceutical Products segment were unfavorably impacted in 2002 by unfavorable product mix and favorably impacted in 2001 by favorable product mix. The gross profit margins for the Diagnostic Products segment were negatively impacted by the effect of the consent decree for all three years, as discussed below. In November 1999, Abbott reached agreement with the U.S. government to have a consent decree entered to settle issues involving Abbotts diagnostics manufacturing operations in Lake County, Ill. The decree, which was amended in December 2000, requires Abbott to ensure its diagnostics manufacturing processes in Lake County conform with the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Quality System Regulation (QSR). The decree allows for the continued manufacture and distribution of medically necessary diagnostic products made in Lake County. However, Abbott is prohibited from manufacturing or distributing certain diagnostic products until Abbott ensures the processes in its Lake County diagnostics manufacturing operations conform with the QSR. The decree allows Abbott to export diagnostic products and components for sale and distribution outside the United States if they meet the export requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Under the terms of the amended consent decree, Abbott was to ensure its diagnostics manufacturing operations are in conformance with the QSR by January 15, 2001. The FDA performed an inspection of Abbotts Lake County, Ill. diagnostics manufacturing operations during the fourth quarter of 2001 and first quarter of 2002 to determine whether those operations are in conformity with the QSR. In May 2002, these operations were found not to be in conformity. Accordingly, Abbott was required to make additional payments to the government and continue its efforts to achieve full compliance. A pretax charge of $129 million, or 6 cents per share, related to this matter was recorded in cost of products sold in 2002. The FDA will determine Abbotts conformance with the QSR after a re inspection of Abbotts facilities. If the FDA concludes that the operations are not in conformance with the QSR, Abbott may continue to be subject to additional costs and loss of revenue. The consent decree affects the sales and margin of the Immunochemistry products of the Diagnostic Products segment. Research and development expense was $1.6 billion in 2002 and 2001, and $1.4 billion in 2000, and represented 8.8 percent of net sales in 2002, compared to 9.7 percent of net sales in 2001, and 9.8 percent of net sales in 2000. The decline in research and development as a percentage of sales in 2002 was due, in part, to the decline in spending on Phase III clinical trials in 2002. Research and development expenditures continue to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products. 28  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.5 percent in 2002, net of the favorable effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar of 0.9 percent, compared to increases of 29.0 percent in 2001, and 1.3 percent in 2000. The increases in selling, general and administration in 2002 and 2001 were due, in part, to the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF in 2001 and for 2002 as the result of restructuring charges. The increases, net of exchange, in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the International, Pharmaceutical and Hospital segments. In 2003, the Pharmaceutical Products and International segments will incur additional selling and administrative expenses to launch Humira. The U.S. Attorneys office in the Southern District of Illinois is conducting an industry wide investigation of the enteral nutritional business, including Abbotts Ross division. Abbott is cooperating with the investigation and is responding to the subpoenas that have been issued. The investigation is both civil and criminal in nature. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of this investigation with certainty, an adverse outcome in this investigation could have a material adverse effect on Abbotts cash flows and results of operations for a particular year, but should not have a material adverse effect on Abbotts financial position. Abbotts income from TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) joint venture was adversely affected in 2001 as a result of the settlement of the U.S. governments investigation of TAPs marketing of Lupron, as discussed in Note 9. Other (Income) Expense, net Other (income) expense, net for 2002, 2001, and 2000 includes charges of $211 million, $99 million and $76 million, respectively, as a result of other than temporary declines in the market values of certain equity securities. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense decreased in 2002 due to a lower level of borrowings and lower interest rates. Net interest expense increased in 2001 primarily due to a higher level of borrowings as a result of the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Taxes on Earnings The effective income tax rates were 24.0 percent in 2002, 17.7 percent in 2001 and 27.0 percent in 2000. The 2001 tax rate is lower than the 2002 and 2000 tax rates due primarily to the effect of the benefit of tax exemptions in several taxing jurisdictions in relation to Abbotts decreased pretax income in 2001 compared to 2002 and 2000. Excluding the effects of the acquisitions of the pharmaceutical business of BASF and of Vysis, Inc., the effective tax rate for 2001 would have been approximately 26 percent. The 2002 tax rate is lower than the 2001 tax rate, excluding the effects of the acquisitions, due in part to the domestic dividend exclusion applicable to the increased earnings of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. Earnings Abbott recorded certain nonrecurring charges to earnings in 2002 primarily related to the FDA consent decree, other than temporary declines in the market value of equity securities, restructuring charges and acquisitions; and in 2001 primarily related to the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF and other items. Management excludes these impacts when analyzing performance so as to better identify ongoing business performance. Managements analysis of these nonrecurring items compared to 29 reported net income and diluted earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) is as follows: Amount Description 2002 2001 (in millions, except per share amounts) Acquired in process research and development $ 108 $ 1,330 TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture income adjustment relating to Lupron marketing settlements 289 U.S. FDA consent decree charge 129 Restructuring charges 174 Acquisition related charges other than acquired in process research and development 262 Other than temporary declines in market value of equity securities and other charges 211 102 Total pretax nonrecurring charges 622 1,983 Taxes on nonrecurring charges 173 590 Net income effect of nonrecurring charges 449 1,393 Net income as reported (GAAP) 2,794 1,550 Net income excluding nonrecurring charges $ 3,243 $ 2,943 Diluted earnings per share effect of nonrecurring charges $ 0.28 $ 0.89 Diluted earnings per share as reported (GAAP) 1.78 0.99 Diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring charges $ 2.06 $ 1.88 Financial Condition Cash Flow Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to approximate or exceed Abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends. In 2002, $106 million was funded to the main domestic pension plan and in 2003 contributions are expected to be $200 million. In addition, $221 million of long term debt is due to be paid in 2003. Abbott will fund these payments out of operating cash flow. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic plan for 2004 and beyond to be between $200 million and $400 million annually. Abbott has no material exposures to off balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2002, Abbotts bond ratings were AA by Standard & Poors Corporation and Aa3 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit of $3.0 billion, which support commercial paper borrowing arrangements. Under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Abbott issued $3.250 billion of long term debt securities in 2001. Proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce short term commercial paper borrowings, which were primarily used to finance the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Under the registration statement, Abbott may issue $250 million in the future in the form of debt securities or common shares without par value. In June 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 25 million shares of Abbotts common stock. In 2000 and 2001, Abbott purchased 10.6 million shares from this authorization for 30 $482 million. Common stock purchases were temporarily suspended in January 2001, following Abbotts announced acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. In 2003, Abbott announced that it plans to purchase the remaining 14.4 million shares from time to time on the open market beginning in 2003. Working Capital At December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, working capital was $2.1 billion, $492 million, and $3.1 billion, respectively. The increase in working capital in 2002 was primarily due to operating cash flows used to decrease short term commercial paper borrowings. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.3 billion in 2002, $1.2 billion in 2001, and $1.0 billion in 2000 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments and hospital equipment placed with customers. This level of capital expenditures is expected to continue, with an increased proportion dedicated to the International and Pharmaceutical segments. Business Combinations, Technology Acquisition and Divestiture In the second quarter 2002, Abbott acquired the cardiovascular stent business of Biocompatibles International plc and certain cardiovascular stent technology rights from Medtronic, Inc. In addition, Abbott acquired an additional 28.8 percent of the issued common shares of Hokuriku Seiyaku Co., Ltd., resulting in Abbott owning substantially all of the common shares of Hokuriku Seiyaku Co., Ltd. The aggregate cash purchase price ($586 million) of these strategic business and technology acquisitions resulted in a pretax charge for acquired in process research and development of approximately $108 million, intangible assets of approximately $145 million and non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $257 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product technology, will be amortized over 4 to 13 years (average of approximately 8 years). Had these acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. On March 2, 2001, Abbott acquired, for cash, the pharmaceutical business of BASF, which included the global operations of Knoll Pharmaceuticals, for approximately $7.2 billion. This acquisition was financed primarily with short and long term borrowings. The acquisition is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The allocation of the acquisition cost is as follows (in billions of dollars): Acquired intangible assets, primarily product rights for marketed products $ 3.5 Goodwill 2.4 Acquired in process research and development 1.2 Deferred income taxes resulting primarily from nondeductible intangibles (0.4 ) Acquired net tangible assets 0.5 Total allocation of acquisition cost $ 7.2 The acquisition cost has been allocated to intangible assets, goodwill, acquired in process research and development, and net tangible assets based on an independent appraisal of fair values. Product rights for marketed products are amortized on a straight line basis over 10 to 16 years (average 13 years), and goodwill was amortized in 2001 on a straight line basis over 20 years. Acquired in process research and development was charged to expense in 2001. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of property and equipment of approximately $630 million, trade accounts receivable of approximately $402 million, and inventories of approximately $275 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable and other liabilities. 31 Prior to the date of acquisition, Abbott began to plan for the integration and restructuring of the business. In 2001 and 2002, Abbott formally approved several restructuring plans and certain costs of implementing formally approved plans have been included in the reported amount of goodwill above. The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Abbott as if the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF had taken place on January 1, 2000. The pro forma information includes primarily adjustments for acquired in process research and development, amortization of product rights for marketed products, interest expense for estimated acquisition debt, and amortization of goodwill. The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations as it would have been had the transaction been effected on the assumed date. 2001 Pro Forma 2000 Pro Forma (in billions, except per share amounts) Net sales $ 16.7 $ 16.1 Net income 2.3 2.5 Diluted earnings per common share 1.46 1.62 In 2001, Abbott acquired, for cash, all of the outstanding common stock of Vysis, Inc., a leading genomic disease management company. Of the cash acquisition cost of approximately $362 million, $162 million was allocated to developed technology, which is amortized over 15 years, and $143 million was charged against earnings in 2001 for acquired in process research and development. The remaining acquisition cost was allocated to net tangible assets and goodwill. Had this acquisition taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. In 2000, Abbott sold its agricultural products business, resulting in a $138.5 million gain. Restructuring Plans (in millions of dollars) In October 2002, Abbott announced restructuring plans to align Abbotts global manufacturing operations with its scientific focus and to achieve greater operating efficiencies in its Diagnostics and International segments. In 2002, Abbott recorded a pretax charge against earnings of $174, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, and employee severance charges. Approximately $83 is classified as cost of products sold, $5 as research and development, and $86 as selling, general and administrative. The restructuring plans will result in the elimination of 2,600 positions offset, in part, by the addition of 500 positions. Approximately 1,400 employees have left Abbott as of December 31, 2002. Employee groups covered under the restructuring plans include manufacturing, research and development, and sales and administrative related functions. Abbott expects the restructuring to yield after tax annual savings of $80 to $100 upon full implementation of the plans. The following summarizes the restructuring activity: Employee Related and Other Asset Impairments Total 2002 Restructuring charges $ 141 $ 33 $ 174 2002 Payments and impairments (37 ) (33 ) (70 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2002 $ 104 $ $ 104 In 2001 and 2002, Abbott implemented restructuring plans related to the operations of the acquired pharmaceutical business of BASF. In addition, Abbott announced in 2001 that it was closing one of its 32 manufacturing operations and relocating production to other Abbott facilities. The following summarizes the restructuring activity: Employee Related and Other Asset Impairments Total 2001 Restructuring charges $ 195 $ 12 $ 207 2001 Payments and impairments (106 ) (12 ) (118 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2001 89 89 2002 Restructuring charges 59 59 2002 Payments (80 ) (80 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2002 $ 68 $ $ 68 In 2002, the $59 restructuring charge has been recorded as goodwill associated with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. In 2001, of the total $207 restructuring charges, $156 has been recorded as goodwill associated with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Of the amount expensed, approximately $36 is classified as cost of products sold, $2 as research and development, and $13 as selling, general and administrative. Employee related costs are primarily severance pay, relocation of former BASF employees and outplacement services. Approved restructuring plans cover approximately 2,400 employees, of which approximately 2,000 have left Abbott as of December 31, 2002. Employee groups covered under the restructuring plan include manufacturing, research and development, and sales and administrative related functions. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." This Interpretation requires the recognition of certain guarantees as liabilities at fair market value and is effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Adoption of the provisions of the Statement and Interpretation will not have a material effect on the financial statements of Abbott. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 and will not have a material effect on the financial statements of Abbott. Abbott accounted for the 2002 restructuring plans in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3 and, accordingly, charged to income in 2002 all appropriate exit costs for plans approved by management before December 31, 2002. Accounting for these restructuring plans under SFAS No. 146 would have resulted in some of the expenses that were recorded in 2002 being recorded in 2003. However, a significant amount of expenses would be charged against income in 2002 under either EITF No. 94 3 or SFAS No. 146. Legislative Issues Abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation. Abbott expects debate to continue at both the federal and state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. If legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing the rate of price increases, for medical products and services. International operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. 33  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbotts operations are discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to the Annual Report on Form 10 K.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.450 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of $2.450 billion of long term debt due in July 2004 and 2006. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. As of December 31, 2002, and 2001, Abbott had $1.6 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average interest rate of 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively, and with an average remaining life of 24 days and 14 days, respectively. The fair market value of long term debt at December 31, 2002, and 2001, amounted to $4.6 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, and consisted primarily of fixed rate (average of 5.5%) debt with maturities through 2023. As of December 31, 2002, and 2001, the fair market value of current and long term investment securities maturing through 2023 amounted to $283 million and $345 million, respectively. Approximately 7 percent and 13 percent of these investments as of December 31, 2002, and 2001, respectively, have fixed interest rates (average of 8.5% and 7.4%, respectively), while the remaining investments have variable rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or market values. (A 100 basis point change is a reasonably possible near term change in rates.) Market Price Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott maintains a portfolio of available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions. The market value of these investments was approximately $175 million and $262 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2002, and 2001. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease the fair value at December 31, 2002 by approximately $35 million. (A 20 percent decrease is a reasonably possible near term change in share prices.) Non Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott maintains a portfolio of equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $48 million and $81 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2002, and 2001. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked to market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 34 2002, and 2001, Abbott held $1.9 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the next calendar year. In addition, certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in the foreign exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains or losses will be included in cost of sales at the time the products are sold, generally within the next calendar year. At December 31, 2002, and 2001, Abbott held $857 million and $571 million, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the next calendar year.
