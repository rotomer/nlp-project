ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products manufactured in Abbott facilities and sold to customers under short term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbotts products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales. Abbotts primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals, diagnostic testing products, nutritional and hospital products. Acquisitions, regulatory issues, and legal issues have impacted Abbotts sales, costs and financial position over the last three years. In 2001, Abbott acquired the Knoll pharmaceutical business from BASF for $7.2 billion and financed the purchase with debt. The Knoll business increased the scale of Abbotts pharmaceutical business, and added significant commercial and research and development capabilities. Also, during the last three years, Abbott financed with debt and cash the acquisitions of several businesses and technologies targeted to deliver sales growth. As a result of these acquisitions, Abbott recorded goodwill and intangibles of $7.0 billion, net of amortization, and acquired in process research and development of $1.5 billion. A portion of Abbotts diagnostic business was subject to product distribution restrictions due to a regulatory review in 1999, and net sales and costs were impacted in this segment as a result of these restrictions. In late 2003, Abbott was informed that it may now distribute the products that were impacted by these restrictions. Also, in 2003, Abbott settled its portion of an industry wide investigation of the enteral nutritional business for $614 million. Abbotts short and long term debt totaled $5.9 billion at December 31, 2003, largely reflecting the acquisitions described above. Abbott has two acquisitions pending with aggregate purchase amounts of $1.6 billion, which will be financed through a combination of operating cash flow, domestic commercial paper borrowings and long term debt. At December 31, 2003, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard and Poors and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. In 2003, Abbott announced that it would distribute the shares of its core hospital products business, Hospira, Inc., to Abbott shareholders in a tax free spin off. The Hospira business is comprised of a large portion of the Hospital Products segment and a small portion of the International segment. Annual sales of Hospira are approximately $2.4 billion. Subsequent to the spin off, the historical results of Hospira will be presented as discontinued operations. The distribution is expected to occur in the first half of 2004. In 2004, Abbott will focus on several key initiatives. In the Pharmaceutical Products Group, which includes the Pharmaceutical Products and International segments, Abbotts penetration of the rheumatoid arthritis market will continue with the global launch of Humira; Abbott expects worldwide sales of Humira to exceed $700 million in 2004. Pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to be focused in five therapeutic areas with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new Humira indications. Abbott is also realigning its pharmaceutical manufacturing operations under a global structure to create a world class supply chain that better aligns the commercial, research and manufacturing organizations. In the Medical Products Group, which includes the Diagnostic Products, Hospital Products and Ross Products segments, the Hospira spin off is projected to take place in the first half of 2004. In 2003, the focus within the Medical Products Group was on repositioning the various businesses for higher growth. The focus in 2004 will be on executing the major initiatives already under way, including increasing the consumer presence of the Ross nutritional business, integrating recent acquisitions, and positioning the 27 vascular, molecular and blood glucose monitoring businesses to deliver strong sales growth. Also in 2004, following the successful inspection of the Lake County diagnostic facility, stabilization and re acceleration of sales growth in the immunoassay business is expected to be accomplished through focus on near term product launches and commercial execution. Critical Accounting Policies Litigation Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." Under SFAS No. 5, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period, as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. For its legal proceedings and environmental exposures, Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $125 million to $200 million. Abbott has recorded reserves of approximately $140 million for these proceedings and exposures. These reserves represent managements best estimate of probable loss, as defined by SFAS No. 5. Sales Rebates A large part of Abbotts domestic businesses sell products to distributors who resell the products to the end customers. Abbott must provide rebates to members of buying groups who purchase from Abbotts distributors, to distributors that sell to their customers at prices determined under a contract between Abbott and the customer, or to state agencies, which administer various programs such as the federal Medicaid and Medicare programs and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases or by reference to a specific price for a product. Factors that complicate the rebate calculations are identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to 24 months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates charged against gross sales in 2003 amounted to approximately $2.6 billion, or 28.3 percent, based on gross sales of approximately $9.2 billion. A one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales and operating income by approximately $92 million. Income Taxes Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items are often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. The company employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. As part of Abbotts calculation of the provision for taxes on earnings, Abbott records the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits. In the United States, Abbotts income tax returns for years after 1992 are open. Pension and Post Employment Benefits Abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations and costs under these programs. With the assistance of outside actuaries, Abbott must develop long term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate, discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for decades, 28 can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period. Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point. In 2003 and 2002, Abbott recorded minimum pension liability adjustments of $155 million and $343 million, respectively, because the accumulated benefit obligations for certain domestic and international defined benefit plans exceeded the market value of the plans assets. This resulted in charges to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $99 million and $203 million, net of taxes, in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The weighted average discount rate used at December 31, 2003 for determining the accumulated benefit obligations for defined benefit plans whose accumulated benefit obligations were in excess of plan assets was 5.9 percent. A one percentage point reduction in the discount rate at December 31, 2003 would result in an increase in the minimum pension liability adjustments and an increase in the charge to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $780 million and $500 million, respectively. Valuation of Intangible Assets Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott values and records. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field, and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value acquired intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles. Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs. During the last three years, the increase in acquired intangible assets, net of amortization, and goodwill amounted to approximately $3.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets amounted to approximately $363 million in 2003. 29 Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by segment for the last three years: Components of Change % Total % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2003 vs. 2002 11.3 1.0 6.8 3.5 2002 vs. 2001 8.6 0.7 8.5 (0.6 ) 2001 vs. 2000 18.5 0.5 20.3 (2.3 ) Total U.S. 2003 vs. 2002 9.2 1.0 8.2 2002 vs. 2001 7.4 0.5 6.9 2001 vs. 2000 17.2 0.5 16.7 Total International 2003 vs. 2002 14.5 1.0 4.4 9.1 2002 vs. 2001 10.6 1.0 11.1 (1.5 ) 2001 vs. 2000 20.7 0.6 26.1 (6.0 ) Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2003 vs. 2002 22.3 3.7 18.6 2002 vs. 2001 13.5 3.9 9.6 2001 vs. 2000 (a) 45.7 2.3 43.4 Diagnostic Products Segment 2003 vs. 2002 5.0 (1.8 ) 6.8 2002 vs. 2001 (1.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.6 ) (0.4 ) 2001 vs. 2000 0.2 (0.2 ) 4.2 (3.8 ) Hospital Products Segment 2003 vs. 2002 3.3 (0.2 ) 3.5 2002 vs. 2001 7.2 (0.6 ) 7.8 2001 vs. 2000 10.8 (1.2 ) 12.0 Ross Products Segment 2003 vs. 2002 2.3 (0.9 ) 3.2 2002 vs. 2001 (2.2 ) 2.2 2001 vs. 2000 2.6 2.1 0.5 International Segment 2003 vs. 2002 12.9 1.6 2.8 8.5 2002 vs. 2001 14.0 1.3 14.6 (1.9 ) 2001 vs. 2000 (a) 33.6 0.4 39.2 (6.0 ) (a)In 2001, Pharmaceutical Products and International segment sales were favorably impacted compared to 2000 by the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. 30 A comparison of the product group sales by segment is as follows (dollars in millions): 2003 Percent Change 2002 Percent Change 2001 Percent Change Pharmaceutical Products Neuroscience $ 886 3 $ 861 (1 ) $ 869 12 Anti Infectives 786 22 644 3 627 1 Diabetes/Metabolism 633 12 564 7 529 N/A Cardiology 672 42 473 52 310 105 Anti Viral 429 13 380 27 298 109 Immunology 246 N/A Diagnostic Products Immunochemistry 2,172 4 2,096 (3 ) 2,170 (3 ) Glucose 542 10 494 8 455 5 Hematology 230 8 212 (4 ) 220 3 Hospital Products Specialty Injectable Pharmaceuticals 858 (2 ) 871 7 811 6 Medication Delivery Systems and Critical Care Devices 823 1 819 2 805 6 Hospital Pharmaceuticals 837 9 770 16 665 21 Ross Products Pediatric Nutritionals 1,093 9 1,003 (4 ) 1,041 Adult Nutritionals 809 (3 ) 838 1 833 4 International Other Pharmaceuticals 2,629 15 2,287 31 1,742 152 Anti Infectives 766 10 696 (2 ) 708 (8 ) Hospital Products 880 12 785 3 759 (2 ) Pediatric Nutritionals 527 8 486 1 480 9 Adult Nutritionals 591 12 528 4 508 Sales of new products in 2003 are estimated to be approximately $940 million, led by the Pharmaceutical Products, Hospital Products and International segments. Sales increases in the Pharmaceutical Products segment for Anti Infectives in 2003 and Cardiology for all three years represent primarily volume increases. The effect of the relatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2003 favorably impacted sales in the Diagnostic Products and International segments. The sales increase in 2003 for Pediatric Nutritionals in the Ross Products segment was due to increased penetration of Similac Advance as well as incremental sales related to Abbotts award of the WIC contract in California. The acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF in 2001 favorably impacted the Diabetes/Metabolism and Cardiology product sales of the Pharmaceutical Products segment and the Other Pharmaceuticals product sales of the International segment for 2001. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in Note 1. Gains recorded in net sales were $241 million in 2003, $164 million in 2002 and $44 million in 2001. On December 31, 2002, the FDA approved Humira for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and in September 2003, the European Union approved Humira. U.S. sales of Humira, reported in Immunology product sales, were $246 million in 2003, and international sales of Humira were $34 million in 2003. Worldwide sales of Humira are forecasted to be more than $700 million in 2004. 31 The expiration of licenses or patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. Significant patent expirations and activities in the next three years are as follows. The original U.S. compound patent on clarithromycin expires in 2005. Approximately 61% of the U.S. sales of clarithromycin in 2003 were made under a form covered by patents that expire after 2005. U.S. sales of clarithromycin were $538 million in 2003. Abbott markets TriCor in the U.S. under a license agreement and patents covering TriCor are being challenged by competitors. Abbott is vigorously defending the patents. U.S. sales of TriCor were $566 million in 2003. Abbotts NDA for Synthroid, which is not protected by a patent, was approved by the FDA in 2002. The FDA is studying the conditions under which competitors may rely on Abbotts NDA to market a competitive product and could grant approval for such generic products at any time. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $565 million in 2003. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 51.9 percent of net sales in 2003 and 2002 compared to 52.4 percent in 2001. The gross profit margin for 2003 was impacted by a charge of $88 million for an impairment of assets and other expenses as a result of a lower sales forecast for Abbokinase; partially offset by favorable product mix, resulting mainly from increased sales in the Pharmaceutical Products segment. The gross profit margin for 2002 included the effects of the FDA consent decree charge, restructuring charges, both as discussed below, and unfavorable product mix; partially offset by the absence of goodwill amortization in 2002. The decrease in the gross profit margin in 2001 was due primarily to increased goodwill and intangibles amortization and integration charges as a result of the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements, higher project expenses for new products, higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth, and the effects of inflation and competitive pricing pressures. In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. There are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products. These rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the Ross and Pharmaceutical Products segments. In addition, pricing pressures unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins for the Ross Products segment. The gross profit margins for the Pharmaceutical Products segment were favorably impacted in 2003 and 2001 by favorable product mix and unfavorably impacted in 2002 by unfavorable product mix. In addition, the gross profit margin in 2003 for the Pharmaceutical Products segment was unfavorably impacted by higher costs for co promoted products and higher other manufacturing costs. The gross profit margins for the Diagnostic Products segment were impacted by the effect of the consent decree for all three years, as discussed below. Under terms of a 1999 consent decree with the U.S. government, Abbott was prohibited from manufacturing certain diagnostic products for sale in the U.S. until its Lake County, Ill. manufacturing facilities were found to be in substantial conformity with the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Quality System Regulation. In December of 2003, the FDA found the facilities to be in substantial conformity and Abbott can start the process of manufacturing impacted products for sale in the U.S. In connection with the consent decree, Abbott recorded remediation costs and payments to the government, including a pretax charge of $129 million in 2002. Research and development expense, excluding acquired in process research and development, was $1.7 billion in 2003 and $1.6 billion in 2002 and 2001, and represented 8.8 percent of net sales in 2003 and 2002 compared to 9.7 percent of net sales in 2001. The decline in research and development as a percentage of sales in 2003 and 2002 compared to 2001 was due, in part, to the decline in spending on Phase III clinical trials in 2003 and 2002. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products. 32  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 26.9 percent in 2003 compared to increases of 6.5 percent in 2002 and 29.0 percent in 2001. In 2003, Abbott recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense, a pretax charge of $614 million related to the settlement of the Ross enteral nutritional investigation. This charge increased selling, general and administration expenses by 15.4 percent over 2002. The increases in selling, general and administrative expense, excluding the charge for the investigation, were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products, including accelerated spending for the launch of Humira, due to its earlier than expected FDA approval, as well as spending on other marketed pharmaceutical products. The increase in selling, general and administration in 2001 reflects the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF in 2001. Increases in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the Pharmaceutical Products, International, and Hospital Products segments. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense decreased in 2003 and 2002 due to a lower level of borrowings and lower interest rates. (Income) From TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. Joint Venture Abbotts income from the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) joint venture was lower in 2003 reflecting decreased sales and a higher level of selling and marketing spending and, in 2001, reflecting the settlement of the U.S. governments investigation of TAPs marketing of Lupron, as discussed in Note 9. Other (Income) Expense, net Other (income) expense, net for 2002 and 2001 includes charges of $211 million and $99 million, respectively, as a result of other than temporary declines in the market values of certain equity securities. Taxes on Earnings The effective income tax rates were 26.3 percent in 2003, 24.0 percent in 2002 and 17.7 percent in 2001. The effective tax rate for 2003 includes the effect of the charge for the settlement of the Ross enteral nutritional investigation and the charges for acquired in process research and development. The effect of these substantially nondeductible charges for 2003 was to increase the effective tax rate by approximately 2.3 percentage points. The 2001 tax rate is lower than the 2003 and 2002 tax rates due primarily to the effect of the benefit of tax exemptions in several taxing jurisdictions in relation to Abbotts lower pretax income in 2001 compared to 2003 and 2002. This had the effect of decreasing the effective tax rate by 8.3 percentage points. The 2002 tax rate is lower than the 2001 tax rate, excluding the effects of the acquisitions of the pharmaceutical business of BASF and of Vysis, Inc. in 2001, due in part to the domestic dividend exclusion applicable to the increased earnings of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of 24.5 percent in 2004 due, in part, to the comparatively lower benefit from the domestic dividend exclusion compared to Abbotts total pretax income. Acquired in process research and development relating to pending 2004 business acquisitions, as discussed below, will be tax effected at discrete tax rates. Spin off of Abbotts Core Hospital Products Business In August 2003, Abbott announced a plan to create a separate publicly traded company for its existing core hospital products business. The new company, Hospira, Inc., will include the operations relating to the manufacture and sale of hospital products including specialty injectable pharmaceuticals, medication delivery systems and critical care devices and injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing. Hospira, which is expected to be spun off by Abbott in the first half of 2004 pending final approval of the distribution by Abbotts Board of Directors, will include most of Abbotts Hospital Products segment and 33 portions of Abbotts International segment. All of the shares of Hospiras common stock will be distributed to Abbott shareholders in a tax free distribution on a pro rata basis. Abbott has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the spin off qualifies as a tax free distribution. Hospira will borrow or assume approximately $750 million of debt, the proceeds of which will be retained by Abbott to pay down domestic commercial paper borrowings. Hospira has filed a preliminary Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which includes 2002 pro forma annual net sales of approximately $2.4 billion, pro forma annual earnings before income taxes of approximately $350 million and annual net cash flow from operating and investing activities of approximately $340 million. Subsequent to the spin off, the financial results of Hospira will be presented as discontinued operations in Abbotts financial statements. Business Combinations and Technology Acquisitions In 2003, Abbott acquired ZonePerfect Nutritional Company, a marketer of healthy and nutritious products for active people, for approximately $160 million in cash; Integrated Vascular Systems, Inc., a developer of a novel vessel closure technology, for approximately $65 million in cash; and Spinal Concepts Inc., a marketer of spinal fixation products used in the treatment of spinal disorders, diseases and injuries for approximately $166 million, in cash, plus additional milestone payments of up to $40 million if agreed upon targets are met. In 2003, Abbott also acquired the assets of JOMED N.V.s coronary and peripheral interventional business for approximately $68 million in cash. These acquisitions resulted in a charge of approximately $100 million for acquired in process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $222 million and non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $182 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product technology, will be amortized over 9 to 25 years (average of approximately 16 years). Had these acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. In 2002, Abbott acquired the cardiovascular stent business of Biocompatibles International plc and certain cardiovascular stent technology rights from Medtronic, Inc. In addition, Abbott acquired an additional 28.8 percent of the issued common shares of Hokuriku Seiyaku Co., Ltd., resulting in Abbott owning substantially all of the common shares of Hokuriku Seiyaku Co., Ltd. The aggregate cash purchase price ($586 million) of these strategic business and technology acquisitions resulted in a pretax charge for acquired in process research and development of approximately $108 million, intangible assets of approximately $145 million and non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $257 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product technology, are amortized over 4 to 13 years (average of approximately 8 years). Had these acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. On March 2, 2001, Abbott acquired, for cash, the pharmaceutical business of BASF, which included the global operations of Knoll Pharmaceuticals, for approximately $7.2 billion. This acquisition was financed primarily with short and long term debt and is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition cost has been allocated to intangible assets, $3.5 billion; goodwill, $2.4 billion; acquired in process research and development, $1.2 billion; and net tangible assets, $0.1 billion, based on an independent appraisal of fair values. Product rights for marketed products are amortized on a straight line basis over 10 to 16 years (average 13 years), and goodwill was amortized in 2001 on a straight line basis over 20 years. Acquired in process research and development was charged to expense in 2001. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of property and equipment of approximately $630 million, trade accounts receivable of approximately $402 million, and inventories of approximately $275 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable and other liabilities. Prior to the date of acquisition, Abbott began to plan for the integration and restructuring of the business. In 2001 and 2002, Abbott formally approved several restructuring plans and certain costs of implementing formally approved plans have been included as goodwill. Had this acquisition taken place on January 1, 2000, pro forma consolidated sales for 2001 would have been $16.7 billion, pro forma net income would have been $2.3 billion and pro forma diluted earnings per share would have been $1.46. 34 In 2001, Abbott acquired, for cash, all of the outstanding common stock of Vysis, Inc., a leading genomic disease management company. Of the cash acquisition cost of approximately $362 million, $162 million was allocated to developed technology, which is amortized over 15 years, and $143 million was charged against earnings in 2001 for acquired in process research and development. The remaining acquisition cost was allocated to net tangible assets and goodwill. Had this acquisition taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. In January 2004, Abbott announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire all of the capital stock of TheraSense, Inc., a leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self monitoring systems, for $1.2 billion in cash. The completion of the acquisition is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of TheraSense common stock, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2004. In addition, in January 2004, Abbott acquired, for approximately $392 million in cash, the shares of i STAT Corporation, a leading manufacturer of point of care diagnostic systems for blood analysis, which Abbott did not already own. In 2004, Abbott expects to record a charge of approximately $171 million for acquired in process research and development, the amount of which is subject to the final appraisal, and approximately $115 million for restructuring and integration costs in connection with these acquisitions. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities amounted to $3.7 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.6 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash from operating activities in 2003 was lower than 2002 due, in part, to the payment of the Ross enteral nutritional settlement, as discussed above. In 2003 and 2002, Abbott funded $200 million and $106 million, respectively, to its main domestic pension plan and funding to this plan in 2004 is expected to be between $250 million and $300 million. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan over the next three to five years to be between $200 million and $400 million annually. The acquisitions of TheraSense and i STAT in 2004 will be financed through a combination of operating cash flow, domestic commercial paper borrowings and long term debt. In addition, $1.650 billion of long term debt is due to be paid in July 2004 that Abbott will fund out of operating cash flow and domestic commercial paper borrowings. Abbott expects to retain approximately $750 million of proceeds from borrowings that will be assumed by Hospira as a result of the spin off. Abbott intends to use these proceeds to reduce domestic commercial paper borrowings. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2003, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard and Poors and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit of $3.0 billion, which support domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Abbott issued long term yen denominated notes in the amount of approximately $926 million that mature from 2007 through 2013. Proceeds from these notes were used to pay off short term yen denominated borrowings and to reduce domestic commercial paper borrowings. Under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September 2003, Abbott issued $500 million of long term debt in February 2004. Abbott may issue up to an additional $1.0 billion in the future in the form of debt under the registration statement. In June 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 25 million shares of Abbotts common stock. In 2000 and 2001, Abbott purchased 10.6 million shares from this authorization for $482 million. Common stock purchases were temporarily suspended in January 2001, following Abbotts 35 announced acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. In 2003, Abbott announced that it plans to purchase the remaining 14.4 million shares from time to time on the open market and purchased 2.7 million of its common shares at a cost of $98 million. As of December 31, 2003, an additional 11.7 million shares may be purchased in future periods under the September 2000 authorization by the Board of Directors. In the first quarter of 2004, Abbott again purchased its common stock on the open market under this authorization. Working Capital At December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, working capital was $2.7 billion, $2.1 billion, and $492 million, respectively. The increase in working capital in 2003 and 2002 versus 2001 was primarily due to operating cash flows used to decrease short term domestic commercial paper borrowings incurred as a result of the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF in 2001. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.2 billion in 2003, $1.3 billion in 2002, and $1.2 billion in 2001 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments and hospital equipment placed with customers. This level of capital expenditures is expected to be lower in 2004 following the spin off of Hospira. An increased proportion of the capital expenditures will be dedicated to the International and Pharmaceutical Products segments. Restructuring Plans (in millions of dollars) In 2002, as discussed in Note 10, Abbott announced restructuring plans to align Abbotts global manufacturing operations with its scientific focus and to achieve greater operating efficiencies in its Diagnostic Products and International segments. In 2002, Abbott recorded a pretax charge against earnings of $174, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, and employee severance charges. Approximately $83 is classified as Cost of products sold, $5 as Research and development, and $86 as Selling, general and administrative. The restructuring plans resulted in the elimination of approximately 2,100 net positions. Employee groups covered under the restructuring plans included manufacturing, research and development, and sales and administrative related functions. The accrued restructuring reserve balance at December 31, 2003 of approximately $23 relates primarily to employee severance obligations, which, by local laws must be paid over time. In 2001 and 2002, as discussed in Note 10, Abbott implemented restructuring plans related to the operations of the acquired pharmaceutical business of BASF and the closing of one of Abbotts manufacturing operations. In 2001, of the total $207 restructuring charges, $156 was recorded as goodwill associated with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Of the amount expensed, approximately $36 is classified as Cost of products sold, $2 as Research and development, and $13 as Selling, general and administrative. Employee related costs are primarily severance pay, relocation of former BASF employees and outplacement services. The restructuring plans resulted in the elimination of approximately 2,400 positions. Employee groups covered under the restructuring plans included manufacturing, research and development, and sales and administrative related functions. In 2002, a $59 restructuring charge was recorded as goodwill associated with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. The accrued restructuring reserve balance at December 31, 2003 of approximately $11 relates primarily to employee severance obligations, which, by local laws must be paid over time. 36 Contractual Obligations (in millions of dollars) Abbott has no material exposures to off balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, with other companies which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. In addition, Abbott periodically acquires small companies in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds. The following table summarizes Abbotts estimated contractual obligations: Payment Due By Period Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and Thereafter Long term debt, including current maturities $ 5,033 $ 1,657 $ 2,009 $ 950 $ 417 Operating lease obligations 381 77 141 102 61 Capitalized auto lease obligations 99 33 66 Purchase commitments (1) 2,402 2,295 66 27 14 Other long term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet (2) 697 248 103 346 Total $ 8,612 $ 4,062 $ 2,530 $ 1,182 $ 838 (1)Purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." This Interpretation requires the recognition of certain guarantees as liabilities at fair market value and is effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Adoption of the provisions of the Statement and Interpretation did not have a material effect on the financial statements of Abbott. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 and will not have a material effect on the financial statements of Abbott. Abbott accounted for the 2002 restructuring plans in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3 and, accordingly, charged to income in 2002 all appropriate exit costs for plans approved by management before December 31, 2002. Accounting for these restructuring plans under SFAS No. 146 would have resulted in some of the expenses that were recorded in 2002 being recorded in 2003. However, a significant amount of expenses would have been charged against income in 2002 under either EITF No. 94 3 or SFAS No. 146. 37 Legislative Issues On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Among the provisions of the Act is a provision granting a subsidy to sponsors of retirement medical plans with prescription drug coverage when the benefit is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare Part D benefit. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has not issued final rules specifying how sponsors should account for this subsidy. Abbott has not estimated the expected favorable impact of the legislation on its retiree medical obligations or costs, and therefore has not reflected any effect of the legislation in the financial statements. The final rules, when issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, could require companies, including Abbott, to retroactively change amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation. Abbott expects debate to continue at both the federal and state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. If additional legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing the rate of price increases, for medical products and services. International operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbotts operations are discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 38   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $3.250 billion and $2.450 billion, respectively, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt due in July 2004 and 2006. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, Abbott had $806 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average interest rate of 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively, and with an average remaining life of 29 days and 24 days, respectively. The fair market value of long term debt at December 31, 2003 and 2002, amounted to $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, and consisted primarily of fixed rate (average of 4.7% and 5.5%, respectively) debt with maturities through 2023. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair market value of current and long term investment securities amounted to $316 million and $283 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or market values. (A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in rates.) Market Price Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott maintains a portfolio of available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions. The market value of these investments was approximately $331 million and $175 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2003 by approximately $66 million. (A 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in share prices.) Non Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott maintains a portfolio of equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $50 million and $48 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked to market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Abbott held $3.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the next calendar year. In addition, certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, 39 generally within the next calendar year. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Abbott held $602 million and $857 million, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the next calendar year. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value (dollars in millions) Receive primarily U.S. Dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 1,887 1.19 $ (11.8 ) $ 1,148 0.99 $ (8.5 ) British Pound 799 0.59 (11.2 ) 511 0.65 (4.4 ) Japanese Yen 229 108.9 0.6 288 121.1 1.0 Canadian Dollar 240 0.76 (2.4 ) 251 0.64 0.6 All other currencies 432 N/A (5.5 ) 539 N/A (6.5 ) Total $ 3,587 $ (30.3 ) $ 2,737 $ (17.8 ) 40
