ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbotts products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales. Abbotts primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals, nutritional products and diagnostic testing products. Abbott also owns 50 percent of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) that Abbott accounts for on the equity method. Integration activities, regulatory and legal issues, the worldwide launch of HUMIRA and the Hospira spin off have impacted Abbotts sales, costs and financial position over the last three years. Subsequent to Abbotts 2001 acquisition of the Knoll pharmaceutical business, which significantly increased the scale of Abbotts pharmaceutical business, Abbott focused on reorganizing and growing its global pharmaceutical business. Abbott has established a global research and development organization and a global manufacturing and distribution organization to serve its domestic and international commercial pharmaceutical operations. Pharmaceutical research and development is focused on five therapeutic areas immunology, oncology, neuroscience, diabetes/metabolism, and viral diseases. U.S. commercial pharmaceutical operations are focused on primary care, specialty and hospital pharmaceuticals. In 2003, Abbott began the worldwide launch of HUMIRA, which achieved worldwide sales of $852 million in 2004. In 2004, Abbott separated its diagnostic segment into four separate divisions immunoassay/hematology, glucose testing, molecular, and point of care to better focus on commercial and scientific opportunities. In early 2004, Abbott acquired TheraSense for $1.2 billion, and began to integrate it with Abbotts glucose testing business. In late 2003, Abbott was informed by the FDA that it may distribute the immunoassay products in the U.S. that were impacted by regulatory restrictions imposed in 1999. Net sales and profits for this business declined over the restricted period, but stabilized in 2004. In 2004, Abbott diagnostics launched more than 80 new products. In the Ross segment in 2003, Abbott settled its portion of an industry wide investigation of the enteral nutritional business for $614 million. In 2004, Abbott completed the spin off of Hospira, Abbotts former hospital products business. Prior to the spin off, the hospital pharmaceutical and vascular device businesses, which Abbott retained, were transferred to the pharmaceutical business and Abbott Vascular Products segment, respectively. Annual sales of Hospira were approximately $2.4 billion. As part of the spin off, Hospira assumed $700 million of debt. The historical operating and cash flow results of Hospira are now presented as discontinued operations. Hospira is contractually obligated to purchase the international hospital assets and operations that were not included in the spin off. TAPs contribution to Abbotts earnings has declined over the last two years. A part of the decline is due to increased competition for Prevacid, TAPs largest selling product, and due to market contraction for prescription proton pump inhibitors. In 2004, TAP recorded additional litigation reserves of $125 million for an anticipated legal settlement. Abbotts short and long term debt totaled $6.8 billion at December 31, 2004, largely incurred to finance acquisitions. Operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have allowed Abbott to reduce debt and fund acquisitions over the last three years. At December 31, 2004, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard and Poors and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. 24 In 2005, Abbott will focus on several key initiatives. In the pharmaceutical business, Abbott expects worldwide sales of HUMIRA, its rheumatoid arthritis drug launched in 2003 and 2004, to exceed $1.3 billion in 2005. Abbott will also focus on appropriate market support for Synthroid, which became subject to generic U.S. competition in mid 2004. U.S. Synthroid sales in 2004 and 2003 were $637 million and $565 million, respectively, and are projected to exceed $400 million in 2005. In 2005, Abbott expects a response from the FDA to Abbotts regulatory submissions made in 2004 for Xinlay, for prostate cancer, Kaletra once daily dosing, Zemplar capsules, and additional HUMIRA indications, and TAP expects a response for its filing for Febuxostat. Abbott expects to submit a similar number of additional pharmaceutical regulatory filings in 2005. Pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to be focused in the five therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new HUMIRA indications. In the immunoassay business, attention will be focused on improving revenue growth by capitalizing on recent product launches, launching additional products, and commercial execution of the existing broad product portfolio. In addition, Abbott expects to place with customers additional ARCHITECT immunochemistry diagnostic instruments in 2005. With a greater focus on consumer marketing, Ross will maximize the strength of its core brands and expand its healthy living market presence. In the other business segments, Abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets. Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates Approximately 40 percent of Abbotts consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these allowances are in two of Abbotts domestic segments the Pharmaceutical Products segment and the Ross Products segment. Abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies, to state agencies which administer the federal Medicaid program and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate occurs from two to 24 months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2004 amounted to approximately $2.4 billion, or 25.6 percent, based on gross sales of approximately $9.3 billion subject to rebate. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales were approximately $1.8 billion in 2003 and $1.4 billion in 2002. A one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease 2004 net sales and operating earnings by approximately $93 million. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $233 million, $191 million and $164 million for cash discounts in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $163 million, $171 million and $157 million for returns in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbotts historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending accrual balances each quarter. In the Ross nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel. Management internally estimates the inventory in the retail channel that is not on the retail shelf. A third party continuously measures time on the retail shelf, which is a relatively significant portion of the time inventory is in the distribution channel. Except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data. In addition, 25 internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual. In the WIC business the state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable price, is reliably estimable. Estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott has the WIC business. External data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers the WIC program, participant data from some of the states, and internally administered market surveys. The USDA has been making its data available for many years. Internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data. At December 31, 2004, Ross had the exclusive WIC business in 12 states. Recent competitive and market conditions have resulted in a trend towards more WIC sales, and therefore a higher sales rebate provision. In the domestic pharmaceutical business, the most significant charges against gross sales are for Medicaid Rebates, Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates and Wholesaler Chargebacks. In order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances, management uses both internal and external estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time. External data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by Abbott. Management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data. To estimate the price rebate percentage, systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price. Abbotts systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant, and Abbott believes they are very reliable. Settlement of rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from 5 to 12 weeks for WIC, 31 to 35 weeks for Medicaid, 27 to 31 weeks for Pharmacy Benefit Managers and 2 to 8 weeks for Wholesaler Chargebacks. Average settlement times are 8 weeks for WIC, 33 weeks for Medicaid, 29 weeks for Pharmacy Benefit Managers and 6 weeks for Wholesaler Chargebacks. The following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals, which comprise approximately 82 percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2004. Information necessary to prepare this table for 2003 and 2002 is not available due to the spin off of Hospira that occurred in 2004. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (dollars in thousands) Pharmaceutical Products Ross Products WIC Rebates Medicaid Rebates Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at January 1, 2004 $ 113,362 $ 229,070 $ 145,195 $ 37,093 Provisions 671,817 596,330 279,681 419,486 Payments (687,132 ) (452,342 ) (271,078 ) (412,526 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 98,047 $ 373,058 $ 153,798 $ 44,053 In the analysis above, due to systems limitations, it is not practical and has not been necessary to break out current versus prior year activity. When applicable, Abbott analyzes current year activity to identify whether material changes in estimate in the current period relate to prior period sales. Changes in estimates for current and prior years rebate and chargeback accruals have not been material to operating income. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For Medicaid and other government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. Income Taxes Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items are often very 26 complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. As part of Abbotts calculation of the provision for taxes on earnings, Abbott records the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits. Each quarter, Abbott reviews its exposures in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." In the U.S., Abbotts federal income tax returns for years 1993 to 1995 are in the process of being settled at amounts that approximate recorded reserves; years 1996 to 2000 are settled, and the income tax returns for years after 2000 are open. As discussed in further detail in Legislative Issues, in February 2005, as a result of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, management concluded that it would remit a portion of its foreign earnings previously considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries. Except for dividends that will be remitted under the Act, Abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries. Pension and Post Employment Benefits Abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations and costs under these programs. With the assistance of outside actuaries, Abbott must develop long term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate, discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for decades, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Recent low interest rates have significantly increased unrecognized actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2004, the unrecognized actuarial losses for Abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were $1.495 billion and $588 million, respectively. Unrecognized actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits. Differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period. Footnote 5 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, Abbott recorded minimum pension liability adjustments of $120 million, $155 million and $343 million, respectively, because the accumulated benefit obligations for certain defined benefit plans exceeded the market value of the plans assets. This resulted in charges to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $76 million, $99 million and $203 million, net of taxes, in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The weighted average discount rate used at December 31, 2004 for determining the accumulated benefit obligations for defined benefit plans whose accumulated benefit obligations were in excess of plan assets was 5.7 percent. A one percentage point reduction in the discount rate at December 31, 2004 would result in an increase in the minimum pension liability adjustments and an increase in the charge to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $779 million and $507 million, respectively. Valuation of Intangible Assets Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott values and records. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field, and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value acquired intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles. Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group 27 level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs. At December 31, 2004, goodwill and intangibles amounted to $5.7 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to approximately $448 million in 2004. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2004. Litigation Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." Under SFAS No. 5, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period, as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. For its legal proceedings and environmental exposures, Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $150 million to $210 million. Abbott has recorded reserves at December 31, 2004 of approximately $155 million for these proceedings and exposures. These reserves represent managements best estimate of probable loss, except for one which is recorded at the minimum, as defined by SFAS No. 5. Stock Compensation Abbott currently measures compensation cost using the intrinsic value based method of accounting for stock options and replacement stock options granted to employees and discloses the impact of the fair value method in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Share Based Payment," which requires that fair value be recorded in the results of operations beginning no later than July 1, 2005. Since there is no market for trading employee stock options, there is no certainty that the result of the fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash. Fair value methods require several assumptions, the most significant of which are stock price volatility and the average life of an option. See Recently Issued Accounting Standards below for further discussion. 28 Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by segment for the last three years: Components of Change % Total % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2004 vs. 2003 13.9 1.6 9.1 3.2 2003 vs. 2002 13.1 1.3 7.8 4.0 2002 vs. 2001 9.8 0.9 9.5 (0.6 ) Total U.S. 2004 vs. 2003 12.8 3.8 9.0 2003 vs. 2002 11.6 1.6 10.0 2002 vs. 2001 8.6 0.9 7.7 Total International 2004 vs. 2003 15.3 (1.0 ) 8.9 7.4 2003 vs. 2002 15.1 0.9 5.0 9.2 2002 vs. 2001 11.5 0.9 12.1 (1.5 ) Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2004 vs. 2003 15.8 7.2 8.6 2003 vs. 2002 19.5 3.3 16.2 2002 vs. 2001 14.3 3.1 11.2 Diagnostic Products Segment 2004 vs. 2003 11.1 (1.2 ) 6.9 5.4 2003 vs. 2002 5.0 (1.8 ) 6.8 2002 vs. 2001 (1.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.6 ) (0.4 ) Ross Products Segment 2004 vs. 2003 8.9 (0.5 ) 9.4 2003 vs. 2002 2.3 (0.9 ) 3.2 2002 vs. 2001 (2.2 ) 2.2 International Segment 2004 vs. 2003 15.9 (1.0 ) 9.5 7.4 2003 vs. 2002 13.5 1.4 3.4 8.7 2002 vs. 2001 15.6 1.3 16.1 (1.8 ) 29 A comparison of the product group sales by segment is as follows. Percentage changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. 2004 Percent Change 2003 Percent Change 2002 Percent Change (dollars in millions) Pharmaceutical Products Primary Care 3,975 23 3,220 26 2,549 22 Specialty 2,069 33 1,561 26 1,242 6 Hospital Pharmaceuticals 838 (1 ) 847 5 805 19 Diagnostic Products Immunochemistry 2,141 2 2,094 3 2,030 (4 ) Diabetes Care 791 46 542 10 494 9 Ross Products Pediatric Nutritionals 1,146 5 1,093 9 1,004 (4 ) Adult Nutritionals 934 15 809 (3 ) 838 1 International Other Pharmaceuticals 3,184 21 2,629 15 2,287 31 Anti Infectives 804 5 766 10 696 (2 ) Hospital Pharmaceuticals 592 15 516 18 437 10 Pediatric Nutritionals 595 13 527 8 486 1 Adult Nutritionals 663 12 591 12 528 4 Sales of new products in 2004 are estimated to be approximately $1.8 billion, led by HUMIRA in the Pharmaceutical Products and International segments and incremental sales of approximately $300 million from the acquisitions of TheraSense, ZonePerfect and EAS. Sales in the Pharmaceutical Products segment of Mobic, TriCor and Flomax in 2004 and 2003 favorably impacted Primary Care Products sales, and increased sales of HUMIRA favorably impacted Specialty Products sales in 2004 and 2003. Increased sales of HUMIRA also favorably impacted Other Pharmaceuticals sales in the International Segment in 2004. Worldwide sales of HUMIRA totaled $852 million in 2004 and $280 million in 2003 and are forecasted to be more than $1.3 billion in 2005. Diagnostic Products and International segment products sales were favorably impacted in 2004 and 2003 by the effect of the relatively weaker U.S. dollar. Diabetes Care product sales for the Diagnostic Products segment were favorably impacted by the acquisition of TheraSense in the second quarter of 2004. In addition, Adult Nutritionals product sales for the Ross Products segment were favorably impacted by the acquisitions of ZonePerfect in the third quarter of 2003 and EAS in the fourth quarter of 2004. In Abbotts annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2003, Abbott disclosed that the FDA was studying conditions under which competitors could rely on Abbotts NDA to market a competitive product to Synthroid. In the second quarter 2004, the FDA granted approval for generic competition to Synthroid and generic competitors have entered the market. U.S. sales of Synthroid in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $637 million, $565 million and $489 million, respectively. In late 2004, clarithromycin became subject to generic competition in the United Kingdom and Germany. In May of 2005 the composition of matter patent on clarithromycin in the U.S. expires. In the U.S., Abbott markets clarithromycin in two forms, the immediate release and the extended release forms, both of which are covered by additional non composition of matter patents. There may be further generic competition for clarithromycin in the U.S. and other countries in 2005 depending on the results of legal proceedings related to the patents. U.S. sales of clarithromycin in 2004 were $458 million, and international sales were $725 million. Sevoflurane has been subject to generic competition in isolated markets outside of the U.S. and further generic competition in international markets is possible. 30 International sales of Sevoflurane were $484 million in 2004. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were $144 million in 2004, $241 million in 2003 and $157 million in 2002. The expiration of licenses or patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. Significant patent expirations and activities in the next three years are as follows. The Pharmaceutical Products segment markets TriCor in the U.S. under a license agreement and patents covering TriCor are being challenged by competitors. Abbott is vigorously defending the patents. U.S. sales of TriCor were $779 million in 2004. In 2004 Abbott received approval for a form of TriCor that has additional therapeutic benefits. This form is covered under non composition of matter patents which expire in 2017. The Pharmaceutical Products segment has an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim to co promote and distribute three of its products. The co promotion rights for all three products phase out over time, beginning in 2004 and ending in 2006, and distribution rights expire predominately in 2007 and partially in 2008. Margins are disproportionately lower for these products than for the other products in this segment. Related revenues recorded in 2004 were $1.6 billion, an increase of 39 percent over 2003. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 54.9 percent of net sales in 2004, 55.0 percent in 2003 and 55.4 percent in 2002. The gross profit margin in 2004 was impacted by the favorable mix effect of exchange on the gross profit margin and by unfavorable product mix, primarily increased sales of lower margin Boehringer Ingelheim products, as discussed above, in the Pharmaceutical Products segment. The gross profit margin for 2003 was impacted by a charge of $88 million for an impairment of assets and other expenses as a result of a lower sales forecast for Abbokinase; partially offset by favorable product mix, resulting mainly from increased sales in the Pharmaceutical Products segment. The gross profit margin for 2002 included the effects of the Lake County diagnostic FDA consent decree charge, restructuring charges and unfavorable product mix; partially offset by the absence of goodwill amortization in 2002. Gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements, higher project expenses for new products, higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth, and the effects of inflation and competitive pricing pressures. In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. There are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products. These rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the Ross and Pharmaceutical Products segments. In addition, pricing pressures unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins for the Ross Products segment in 2004, 2003 and 2002. The gross profit margins for the Pharmaceutical Products segment were unfavorably impacted in 2004 and 2002 by unfavorable product mix and favorably impacted in 2003 by favorable product mix. In addition, the gross profit margins in 2004 and 2003 for the Pharmaceutical Products segment were unfavorably impacted by increased sales of lower margin Boehringer Ingelheim products and higher other manufacturing costs. The gross profit margins in 2003 and 2002 for the Diagnostic Products segment were impacted by the effects of the FDA consent decree, as discussed below. Under terms of a 1999 consent decree with the U.S. government, Abbott was prohibited from manufacturing certain diagnostic products for sale in the U.S. until its Lake County, Ill. manufacturing facilities were found to be in substantial conformity with the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Quality System Regulation. In December of 2003, the FDA found the facilities to be in substantial conformity and Abbott began the process of manufacturing impacted products for sale in the U.S. In connection with the consent decree, Abbott recorded remediation costs and payments to the government, including a pretax charge of $129 million in 2002. 31  Research and development expense, excluding acquired in process research and development, was $1.7 billion in 2004, $1.6 billion in 2003 and $1.5 billion in 2002 and represented 8.6 percent of net sales in 2004 compared to 9.4 percent of net sales in 2003 and 9.7 percent of net sales in 2002. Research and development increased in 2004 and 2003, but not at the same rate as sales due, in part, to lower spending on Phase III clinical trials in 2004 and 2003 compared to 2002. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2.4 percent in 2004 compared to increases of 29.1 percent in 2003 and 6.7 percent in 2002. In 2003, Abbott recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses, a pretax charge of $614 million related to the settlement of the Ross enteral nutritional investigation. This 2003 charge reduced the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses by 15.0 percentage points for 2004 and increased selling, general and administration expenses by 16.5 percentage points over 2002. The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding the charge for the investigation, were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products, including spending for the launch of HUMIRA, as well as spending on other marketed pharmaceutical products. Increases in all three years also reflect inflation, the effect of acquisitions and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the Pharmaceutical Products and International segments. In 2004, Abbott reflected the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. 106 2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." The effect of this change reduced the post employment medical and dental plan net cost for 2004 by approximately $33 million. (Income) From TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. Joint Venture Abbotts income from the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) joint venture was lower in 2004 and 2003 due to decreased sales due to market contraction for prescription proton pump inhibitors, and in 2004 by approximately $40 million as a result of an agreement with plaintiffs to settle litigation. Other (Income) Expense, net Other (income) expense, net for 2002 includes a charge of $194 million as a result of other than temporary declines in the market values of certain equity securities. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased in 2004 due to a higher level of debt, partially offset by higher interest income. Net interest expense decreased in 2003 and 2002 due to a lower level of borrowings and lower interest rates. Taxes on Earnings The effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were 23.0 percent in 2004, 26.1 percent in 2003 and 23.3 percent in 2002. The effective tax rate for 2004 reflects adjustments of prior years tax requirements primarily as a result of resolutions of prior years tax audits. The 2004 effective tax rate also reflects the effect of non deductible acquired in process research and development. The effect of these items for 2004 was to decrease the effective tax rate by approximately 1.2 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2003 includes the effect of the charge for the settlement of the Ross enteral nutritional investigation and the charges for acquired in process research and development. The effect of these charges for 2003 was to increase the effective tax rate by approximately 2.4 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of around 24.0 percent in 2005, excluding the effects of adoption of the new stock compensation rules and for dividends that will be remitted under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, both as discussed below. 32 Spin off of Abbotts Core Hospital Products Business On April 12, 2004, Abbotts Board of Directors declared a special dividend distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Hospira, Inc. For every 10 Abbott common shares held at the close of business on April 22, 2004, Abbott shareholders received one share of Hospira common stock on April 30, 2004. All of the shares of Hospiras common stock were distributed to Abbott shareholders on a pro rata basis. Abbott has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the spin off qualifies as a tax free distribution to Abbott and its U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Cash, which is generally taxable to the recipient, was paid in lieu of fractional shares. Hospira included the operations relating to the manufacture and sale of hospital products including specialty injectable pharmaceuticals, medication delivery systems and critical care devices and injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing. Hospira included Abbotts Hospital Products segment, after that segments reorganization on January 1, 2004, and portions of Abbotts International segment. The income and cash flows of Hospira and the direct transaction costs of the spin off have been presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Statement of Cash Flows. Prior years balance sheets have not been adjusted to reflect the effect of the spin off. The legal transfer of certain operations and assets (net of liabilities) outside the United States is expected to occur in 2005 and 2006. Approximately half of these operations are expected to be transferred to Hospira in 2005 with the remaining operations transferring in the first half of 2006. These operations and assets are used in the conduct of Hospiras international business and Hospira is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets. These assets and liabilities have been presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004. The assets and liabilities held for sale consist primarily of inventories, trade accounts receivable, equipment and trade accounts payable, salaries and other accruals. In April 2004, Abbott borrowed and Hospira assumed $700 million of debt, the proceeds of which were retained by Abbott to reduce short term borrowings. Hospira is solely responsible for repayment of the principal and for payment of interest on this debt. Abbott has retained liabilities for taxes on income prior to the spin off, post employment medical and dental benefits for most of Hospiras U.S. retired employees and U.S. retirement eligible employees, certain potential liabilities, if any, related to alleged improper pricing practices in connection with federal, state and private reimbursement for certain drugs, and the defined benefit retirement plan liabilities and plan assets for most of Hospiras retired employees. In connection with the spin off, Abbotts defined benefit, medical and dental and employee stock option programs have been adjusted. Business Combinations and Technology Acquisitions In 2004, Abbott paid approximately $2.3 billion for strategic business and technology acquisitions, as follows. In the fourth quarter 2004, Abbott acquired EAS, a nutritional company with a portfolio of nationally recognized brands, for approximately $320 million in cash and Spine Next, a manufacturer of orthopedic spinal implant devices, for approximately $58 million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to $23 million upon achievement of future targets. These fourth quarter acquisitions resulted in a charge of $47 million for acquired in process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $152 million, non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $191 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $60 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily trade names, are amortized over 5 to 20 years (average of approximately 18 years). In the second quarter 2004, Abbott acquired TheraSense, Inc., a leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self monitoring systems, for approximately $1.2 billion in cash. In the second quarter 2004, Abbott also acquired certain other product technologies for approximately $352 million. These second quarter acquisitions resulted in a charge of $164 million for acquired in process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $912 million, non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $623 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $241 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product 33 technology, are amortized over 9 to 17 years (average of approximately 13 years). In the first quarter 2004, Abbott acquired i STAT Corporation, a manufacturer of point of care diagnostic products for blood analysis, for approximately $394 million in cash. This acquisition resulted in a charge of approximately $60 million for acquired in process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $263 million, non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $109 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $105 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product technology, are amortized over 7 to 18 years (average of approximately 17 years). In 2003, Abbott paid approximately $459 million for strategic business and technology acquisitions, as follows. Abbott acquired ZonePerfect Nutrition Company, a marketer of healthy and nutritious products for active people, for approximately $160 million in cash; Integrated Vascular Systems, Inc., a developer of a novel vessel closure technology, for approximately $65 million in cash; and Spinal Concepts Inc., a marketer of spinal fixation products used in the treatment of spinal disorders, diseases and injuries, for approximately $166 million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to $40 million if agreed upon targets are met. Abbott also acquired the assets of JOMED N.V.s coronary and peripheral interventional business for approximately $68 million in cash. These acquisitions resulted in a charge of approximately $100 million for acquired in process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $222 million and non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $182 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product technology, are amortized over 9 to 25 years (average of approximately 16 years). In 2002, Abbott acquired the cardiovascular stent business of Biocompatibles International plc and certain cardiovascular stent technology rights from Medtronic, Inc. In addition, Abbott acquired an additional 28.8 percent of the issued common shares of Hokuriku Seiyaku Co., Ltd., resulting in Abbott owning substantially all of the common shares of Hokuriku Seiyaku Co., Ltd. The aggregate cash purchase price ($586 million) of these acquisitions resulted in a charge for acquired in process research and development of approximately $108 million, intangible assets of approximately $145 million and non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $257 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product technology, are amortized over 4 to 13 years (average of approximately 8 years). Had the above acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to $4.3 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash from operating activities in 2003 was lower than 2002 due, in part, to the payment of the Ross enteral nutritional settlement, as discussed above. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, $482 million, $200 million and $106 million, respectively, was contributed to the main domestic defined benefit plan. In addition, Abbott transferred approximately $45 million to Hospira in 2004 in accordance with the employee benefit agreement governing the assumption by Hospira of certain defined benefit plan assets and liabilities. In January 2005, approximately $640 million was contributed to the main domestic defined benefit plan and $140 million was contributed to the post employment medical and dental benefit plans. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan in 2006 to 2010 to be between $200 million and $400 million annually. The increased contribution in 2005 is due, in part, to anticipation of investment of cash to be remitted under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2004, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard and Poors and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit of $3.0 billion, which support domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements. 34 In June 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 25 million shares of Abbotts common stock and Abbott purchased 13.3 million shares from this authorization from 2000 through 2003. In 2004, Abbott purchased the remaining 11.7 million of its common shares under this authorization at a cost of approximately $500 million. In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 50 million shares of Abbotts common stock from time to time. No purchases under this authorization were made in 2004. Under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September 2003, Abbott issued $1.5 billion of long term debt in 2004 that matures in 2009 through 2014 with interest rates ranging from 3.5 percent to 4.35 percent. Proceeds from this debt were used to fund the acquisition of TheraSense and to pay down domestic commercial paper borrowings. In connection with these borrowings, Abbott entered into interest rate hedge contracts totaling $1.5 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of the $1.5 billion of debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed rate debt due to changes in the long term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. Abbott retained $700 million of proceeds from borrowings that Hospira assumed as a result of the spin off and used these proceeds to reduce domestic commercial paper borrowings. In addition, Abbott retired long term debt of $1.65 billion in 2004 with proceeds from domestic commercial paper borrowings. Working Capital At December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, working capital was $3.9 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.3 billion in 2004 and $1.1 billion in 2003 and 2002 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments placed with customers. An increased proportion of the capital expenditures will be dedicated to domestic and international pharmaceutical operations. Contractual Obligations Abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, with other companies which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. In addition, Abbott periodically acquires small companies 35 in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds. The following table summarizes Abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. Payment Due By Period Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt, including current maturities and future interest payments $ 5,829 $ 371 $ 2,269 $ 1,549 $ 1,640 Operating lease obligations 366 100 131 84 51 Capitalized auto lease obligations 89 30 59 Purchase commitments (a) 1,707 1,571 121 11 4 Other long term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet Benefit plan obligations, including minimum pension liability adjustments of $577 1,913 201 198 1,514 Other 855 310 148 397 Total $ 10,759 $ 2,072 $ 3,091 $ 1,990 $ 3,606 (a)Purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Share Based Payment." The revised SFAS No. 123 requires that the fair value of stock options be recorded in the results of operations beginning no later than July 1, 2005. Stock compensation expense under the prior rules would have reduced reported diluted earnings per share by 12 cents in 2004. Upon adoption of the revised standard, prior awards are charged to expense under the prior rules, and awards after adoption are charged to expense under the revised rules. Abbott has not determined the effect of the new standard on its earnings, however, expense under the new standard could be somewhat higher. The effect of adopting the new rules on reported diluted earnings per share is dependent on the number of options granted in the future; the terms of those awards and their fair values, and therefore, the effect on diluted earnings per share could change. Abbott expects to adopt the revised rules on July 1, 2005, but has not determined whether it would adopt prospectively, or retrospectively to January 1, 2005. See footnote 11 to the consolidated financial statements for assumptions used by management in calculating the fair value of employee stock options. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs." This statement clarifies the accounting for the abnormal amount of idle facilities expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. This statement requires that those items be recognized as current period expense. In addition the statement requires that allocation of fixed overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. This statement is effective for inventory costs incurred after December 31, 2005. Adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on the financial statements of Abbott. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 was effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 and did not have a material effect on the financial statements of Abbott. Abbott accounted for the 2002 restructuring plans in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3 and, accordingly, charged to income in 2002 all appropriate exit costs for plans approved by management before December 31, 2002. Accounting for these restructuring plans under SFAS No. 146 would have resulted in some of the expenses that were 36 recorded in 2002 being recorded in 2003. However, a significant amount of expenses would have been charged against income in 2002 under either EITF No. 94 3 or SFAS No. 146. Legislative Issues On October 22, 2004, the President of the United States signed The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Among the provisions of the Act is a provision that allows for the exclusion from income of a portion of the remittances of earnings of foreign subsidiaries to U.S. shareholders through December 31, 2005. The portion of the earnings available for remittance are those earnings designated as reinvested indefinitely in foreign operations as disclosed in Abbotts 2002 financial statements. Abbott would have up to approximately $4.2 billion of such earnings available for remittance, with an estimated tax of up to $340 million if the entire amount were remitted under the current language of the legislation. The Act continues to be subject to interpretation and rulemaking, and the estimated expense could be affected by that activity. On January 13, 2005, the U.S. Treasury and IRS issued initial guidance covering the Act. Financial Accounting Staff Position 109 2 requires companies to recognize a tax liability for remittance of earnings under the Act in the period management concludes that it would remit those earnings. As of December 31, 2004, management had not decided to remit earnings under the Act. In February 2005, Abbott concluded that it would remit approximately $600 million in 2005 of foreign earnings previously reinvested indefinitely in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Abbott is continuing to evaluate whether it will remit all or a portion of the remaining $3.6 billion available for remittance under the Act, and expects to decide later in the year. The additional income tax expense required for the $600 million remittance would be up to approximately $60 million and will be recorded in the first quarter of 2005. Other provisions of the Act include a new deduction for qualified domestic production activities and elimination of the extraterritorial income exclusion (ETI). Financial Accounting Staff Position 109 1 requires that the deduction for production activities be recognized in the year reported on the income tax return. The deduction for production activities will be gradually phased in from 2005 to 2009, while the ETI will be gradually phased out in 2005 and 2006. Abbott expects the net effect on these two changes to approximately offset once the phase ins are completed, with 2005 neutral and with slightly higher expense for 2006 to 2009. Effective January 1, 2005, the Medicare formula for reimbursement to providers for physician administered drugs changed. Abbott has determined that the formula change is not expected to have a significant effect on its results of operations. Abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation. Abbott expects debate to continue in the U.S. at both the federal and the state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. Abbott believes that if further legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing access to health care products and services, or reducing prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services. International operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbotts operations are discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 37   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $3.1 billion and $3.25 billion, respectively, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt due July 2006 through March 2014. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, Abbott had $1.6 billion and $806 million, respectively, of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average annual interest rate of 2.2% and 1.1%, respectively, with an average remaining life of 38 days and 29 days, respectively. The fair market value of long term debt at December 31, 2004 and 2003, amounted to $5.0 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively, and consisted primarily of fixed rate (average of 4.3% and 4.7%, respectively) debt with maturities through 2023. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair market value of current and long term investment securities amounted to $854 million and $316 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or market values. (A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in rates.) Market Price Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott maintains a portfolio of available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions. The market value of these investments was approximately $96 million and $331 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2004 by approximately $19 million. (A 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in share prices.) Non Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott maintains a portfolio of equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $30 million and $50 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. No individual investment is in excess of $14 million. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked to market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Abbott held $3.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the next calendar year. In addition, certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, 38 generally within the next calendar year. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Abbott held $984 million and $602 million, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the next calendar year. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003: 2004 2003 Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) (dollars in millions) Receive primarily U.S. Dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 1,688 1.2843 $ (39.1 ) $ 1,887 1.19 $ (11.8 ) British Pound 1,112 0.542 (26.7 ) 799 0.59 (11.2 ) Japanese Yen 533 107.3 9.2 229 108.9 0.6 Canadian Dollar 301 0.785 (20.0 ) 240 0.76 (2.4 ) All other currencies 601 N/A (3.3 ) 432 N/A (5.5 ) Total $ 4,235 $ (79.9 ) $ 3,587 $ (30.3 ) 39
