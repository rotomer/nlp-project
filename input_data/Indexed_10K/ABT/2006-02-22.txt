ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbotts products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales. Abbotts primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals, nutritional products and diagnostic testing products. Abbott also owns 50 percent of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) that Abbott accounts for on the equity method. The worldwide launch of HUMIRA, the spin off of Hospira, integration and restructuring activities and the loss of patent protection for some products have impacted Abbotts sales, costs and financial position over the last three years. Subsequent to Abbotts 2001 acquisition of the Knoll pharmaceutical business, which significantly increased the scale of Abbotts pharmaceutical business, Abbott focused on reorganizing and growing its global pharmaceutical business. Abbott has established a global research and development organization and a global manufacturing and distribution organization to serve its domestic and international commercial pharmaceutical operations. Pharmaceutical research and development is focused on five therapeutic areas immunology, oncology, neuroscience, diabetes/metabolism, and viral diseases. U.S. commercial pharmaceutical operations are focused mainly on primary care and specialty pharmaceuticals. In 2003, Abbott began the worldwide launch of HUMIRA, which increased its worldwide sales to $1.4 billion in 2005 compared to $852 million in 2004. In 2005, Abbott and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) amended their agreement whereby Abbott distributed and promoted BI products. Effective January 1, 2006, Abbott will no longer distribute BI products but will receive residual commissions. Abbotts gross margins for BI products from the prior agreement in effect through December 31, 2005 were substantially lower than its average gross margin. 2005 sales of BI products were $2.3 billion. Increased generic competition resulted in U.S. sales of Synthroid declining 22 percent in 2005 while holding a 36 percent market share. In 2004, Abbott separated its diagnostic segment into four separate divisions immunoassay/hematology, diabetes care, molecular, and point of care to better focus on commercial and scientific opportunities. In early 2004, Abbott acquired TheraSense for $1.2 billion, and began to integrate it with Abbotts diabetes care business. In late 2003, Abbott was informed by the FDA that it may distribute the immunoassay products in the U.S. that were impacted by regulatory restrictions imposed in 1999. Net sales and profits for this business declined over the restricted period, but stabilized in 2004 and 2005. In 2005, Abbott diagnostics launched more than 50 new products. In the Ross segment in 2003, Abbott settled its portion of an industry wide investigation of the enteral nutritional business for $614 million. In 2004, Abbott completed the spin off of Hospira, Abbotts former hospital products business. Annual sales of Hospira were approximately $2.4 billion. As part of the spin off, Hospira assumed $700 million of debt. The historical operating and cash flow results of Hospira are presented as discontinued operations. Hospira is contractually obligated to purchase the international hospital assets and operations that were not included in the spin off. The legal transfer of certain remaining operations and assets (net of liabilities) outside the United States is expected to occur in the first half of 2006. In early 2006, Abbott reached agreement to acquire Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, subject to Boston Scientifics acquisition of Guidant. Guidants annual revenues from these businesses are approximately $1 billion. The purchase price would be $4.1 billion, plus contingent milestone payments of $500 million. 28 TAPs contribution to Abbotts earnings declined in 2004 and 2003. A part of the decline was due to increased competition for Prevacid, TAPs largest selling product, and due to market contraction for prescription proton pump inhibitors. In 2004, TAP recorded additional litigation reserves of $125 million for an anticipated legal settlement. Abbotts short and long term debt totaled $6.6 billion at December 31, 2005, largely incurred to finance acquisitions. Operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have allowed Abbott to reduce debt and fund acquisitions over the last three years. At December 31, 2005, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard and Poors and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. In 2006, Abbott will focus on several key initiatives. In the global pharmaceutical business, Abbott will launch newly approved indications for HUMIRA. Abbott will also focus on appropriate market support for Synthroid, which became subject to generic U.S. competition in mid 2004, and for sevoflurane, which became subject to generic competition in December 2005. In 2005, TAP received an approvable letter from the FDA for febuxostat. Contingent upon FDA approval, TAP plans to launch febuxostat in 2006. Pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to be focused in the five therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new HUMIRA indications. Abbott expects to submit additional pharmaceutical regulatory filings in 2006. In the immunoassay business, attention will be focused on improving revenue growth by capitalizing on recent product launches, including the U.S. launch of the blood screening system, PRISM, launching additional products, and commercial execution of the existing broad product portfolio. In the hematology business, attention will be focused on the continued launch of CELL DYN Sapphire and other analyzers. For diabetes care, Abbott will continue the launch of FreeStyle Connect and Abbott anticipates the approval of FreeStyle Navigator in 2006. Upon closure of the acquisition of Guidants vascular business, planning for its integration would be a key activity in the vascular business. Focus in this business will also be on the 2005 launch of Xact Carotid Stent and Emboshield Embolic Protection System and the projected approval of ZoMaxx, Abbotts drug eluting stent, in Europe. With a greater focus on consumer marketing, Ross will maximize the strength of its core brands and further develop its healthy living market presence. In the other business segments, Abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets. Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates Approximately 40 percent of Abbotts consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances are in two of Abbotts domestic segments the Pharmaceutical Products segment and the Ross Products segment. Abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies, to state agencies which administer the federal Medicaid program and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to 24 months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003 amounted to approximately $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, or 22.9 percent, 25.6 percent, and 22.7 percent, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $10.9 billion, $9.3 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales and operating earnings by approximately $109 million in 2005. Other 29 allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $284 million, $233 million and $191 million for cash discounts in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $162 million, $163 million and $171 million for returns in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbotts historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending accrual balances each quarter. In the Ross nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel. Management internally estimates the inventory in the retail channel that is not on the retail shelf. A third party continuously measures time on the retail shelf, which is a relatively significant portion of the time inventory is in the distribution channel. Except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data. In addition, internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual. In the WIC business, the state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable price, is reliably estimable. Estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott has the WIC business. External data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers the WIC program, participant data from some of the states, and internally administered market surveys. The USDA has been making its data available for many years. Internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data. At December 31, 2005, Ross had the exclusive WIC business in 11 states. In the domestic pharmaceutical business, the most significant charges against gross sales are for Medicaid Rebates, Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates and Wholesaler Chargebacks. In order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances, management uses both internal and external estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time. External data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by Abbott. Management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data. To estimate the price rebate percentage, systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price. Abbotts systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant, and Abbott believes they are reliable. 30 The following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals, which comprise approximately 80 percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2005. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (dollars in thousands) Pharmaceutical Products Ross Products WIC Rebates Medicaid Rebates Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at January 1, 2003 $ 65,979 $ 196,200 $ 115,539 $ 24,586 Provisions 527,803 358,173 244,037 338,316 Payments (480,420 ) (325,303 ) (214,381 ) (325,809 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 113,362 229,070 145,195 37,093 Provisions 671,817 596,330 279,681 419,486 Payments (687,132 ) (452,342 ) (271,078 ) (412,526 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 98,047 373,058 153,798 44,053 Provisions 641,189 663,043 253,499 450,901 Payments (644,460 ) (581,098 ) (273,166 ) (446,867 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 94,776 $ 455,003 $ 134,131 $ 48,087 Adjustments for prior years rebate accruals have not been material. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For Medicaid and other government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. Income Taxes Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items are often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. As part of Abbotts calculation of the provision for taxes on earnings, Abbott records the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits. Each quarter, Abbott reviews its exposures in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." In the U.S., Abbotts federal income tax returns through 2000 are settled, and the income tax returns for years after 2000 are open. Except for taxes on dividends that were remitted under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries. Pension and Post Employment Benefits Abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations and costs under these programs. With the assistance of outside actuaries, Abbott must develop long term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate, discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure liabilities as of December 31, 2005 was determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. Prior to December 31, 2005, the discount rate was determined by reference to a composite corporate AA bond index. The health care cost trend rate represents Abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for decades, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Recent low interest rates have significantly increased unrecognized actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 31 2005, the unrecognized actuarial losses for Abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were $1.5 billion and $698 million, respectively. Unrecognized actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits. Differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period. Footnote 4 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point. In 2005, Abbott reversed previously recorded minimum pension liability adjustments of $562 million because the assets of certain defined benefit plans were now in excess of the accumulated benefit obligations due primarily to plan contributions in 2005. This resulted in a credit to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $346 million, net of taxes. In 2004 and 2003, Abbott recorded minimum pension liability adjustments of $120 million and $155 million, respectively, because the accumulated benefit obligations for certain defined benefit plans exceeded the market value of the plans assets. This resulted in charges to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $76 million and $99 million, net of taxes, in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Valuation of Intangible Assets Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field, and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis using market participant assumptions. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value most of its acquired intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles. Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs. At December 31, 2005 goodwill and intangibles amounted to $5.2 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to approximately $490 million in 2005. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2005, 2004 or 2003. Litigation Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." Under SFAS No. 5, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period, as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. For its legal proceedings and environmental exposures, Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $15 million to $60 million. Reserves of approximately $35 million have been recorded at December 31, 2005 for these proceedings and exposures. These reserves represent managements best estimate of probable loss, as defined by SFAS No. 5. 32 Stock Compensation Through December 31, 2005, Abbott measured compensation cost using the intrinsic value based method of accounting for stock options and replacement stock options granted to employees and disclosed the impact of the fair value method in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. In 2006, Abbott will adopt SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment," which requires that fair value be recorded in the results of operations. Since there is no market for trading employee stock options, management must use a fair value method. There is no certainty that the results of a fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash. Fair value methods require management to make several assumptions, the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model, stock price volatility and the average life of an option. Abbott began preparing for adoption of the new standard in 2004. Abbott has readily available grant by grant historical activity for several years in its option administration system. Using this data, Abbott compared valuation results using the binomial method to the Black Scholes method Abbott had been using and found the results to be comparable. Abbott evaluated whether certain holders of stock options exercised their options differently than other holders and did not find any differentiating pattern among holders. Abbott studied its implied volatility and concluded that a combination of historical and implied volatility will be a better measure than historical volatility alone. Abbott also quantified the additional paid in capital amount available for use in determining tax effects of early exercise for measurement of tax expense. Abbott will use the modified prospective method of adoption. Under this method, prior years financial results will not include the impact of recording stock options using fair value. Footnote 10 quantifies the effect of application of fair value to 2005 and prior awards. Based upon the valuation of stock options granted in the 2006 annual grant, which comprise the majority of the grant activity for the year, Abbott estimates the impact of the 2006 change in stock compensation expense on diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.15, which includes $0.14 per diluted share for the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options. The 2006 expense for stock compensation is dependent on the number of options granted in the future, the terms of those awards and their fair value, and therefore, the effect on diluted earnings per share could change. 33 Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by segment for the last three years: Components of Change % Total % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2005 vs. 2004 13.5 0.1 12.1 1.3 2004 vs. 2003 13.9 1.6 9.1 3.2 2003 vs. 2002 13.1 1.3 7.8 4.0 Total U.S. 2005 vs. 2004 13.0 0.8 12.2 2004 vs. 2003 12.8 3.8 9.0 2003 vs. 2002 11.6 1.6 10.0 Total International 2005 vs. 2004 14.2 (0.7 ) 12.0 2.9 2004 vs. 2003 15.3 (1.0 ) 8.9 7.4 2003 vs. 2002 15.1 0.9 5.0 9.2 Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2005 vs. 2004 16.1 1.6 14.5 2004 vs. 2003 15.8 7.2 8.6 2003 vs. 2002 19.5 3.3 16.2 Diagnostic Products Segment 2005 vs. 2004 11.2 (0.7 ) 9.9 2.0 2004 vs. 2003 11.1 (1.2 ) 6.9 5.4 2003 vs. 2002 5.0 (1.8 ) 6.8 Ross Products Segment 2005 vs. 2004 8.5 (0.9 ) 9.4 2004 vs. 2003 8.9 (0.5 ) 9.4 2003 vs. 2002 2.3 (0.9 ) 3.2 International Segment 2005 vs. 2004 13.0 (0.3 ) 10.4 2.9 2004 vs. 2003 15.9 (1.0 ) 9.5 7.4 2003 vs. 2002 13.5 1.4 3.4 8.7 34 A comparison of the product group sales by segment is as follows. Percentage changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. 2005 Percent Change 2004 Percent Change 2003 Percent Change (dollars in millions) Pharmaceutical Products Primary Care $ 4,788 18 $ 4,041 22 $ 3,324 26 Specialty 2,908 18 2,460 28 1,915 23 Diagnostic Products Immunochemistry 2,187 2 2,141 2 2,094 3 Diabetes Care 1,067 35 791 46 542 10 Ross Products Pediatric Nutritionals 1,097 (4 ) 1,146 5 1,093 9 Adult Nutritionals 1,077 15 934 15 809 (3 ) International Other Pharmaceuticals 3,656 15 3,184 21 2,629 15 Anti Infectives 838 4 804 5 766 10 Hospital Pharmaceuticals 669 13 592 15 516 18 Pediatric Nutritionals 698 17 595 13 527 8 Adult Nutritionals 715 8 663 12 591 12 Sales in the Pharmaceutical Products segment of Mobic, TriCor, Omnicef and Flomax favorably impacted Primary Care Products sales, and increased sales of HUMIRA favorably impacted Specialty Products sales. U.S. sales of Synthroid, which is now subject to generic competition, were $498 million, $637 million, and $565 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Increased sales of HUMIRA and Kaletra also favorably impacted Other Pharmaceuticals sales in the International Segment in 2005 and 2004. Worldwide sales of HUMIRA totaled $1.4 billion in 2005, $852 million in 2004 and $280 million in 2003. Diagnostic Products and International segment products sales were favorably impacted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 by the effect of the relatively weaker U.S. dollar. Diabetes Care product sales for the Diagnostic Products segment were favorably impacted by the acquisition of TheraSense in the second quarter of 2004. In addition, Adult Nutritionals product sales for the Ross Products segment were favorably impacted by the acquisitions of ZonePerfect in the third quarter of 2003 and EAS in the fourth quarter of 2004. The decrease in sales for pediatric nutritionals in 2005 was primarily due to overall infant nutritionals non WIC category decline and competitive share loss. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were $177 million in 2005, $144 million in 2004 and $241 million in 2003. Sales of new products in 2005 are estimated to be approximately $1.6 billion, led by HUMIRA in the Pharmaceutical Products and International segments and incremental sales of approximately $260 million from the 2004 acquisitions of TheraSense and EAS. The expiration of licenses, patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. Significant ongoing generic activities, and significant patent and license expirations in the next three years are as follows. The U.S. composition of matter patent for Depakote expires in 2008. The Pharmaceutical Products segments sales of Depakote in 2005 were $1 billion. The Pharmaceutical Products segment has an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim to co promote and distribute three of its products. In 2005, Abbott and Boehringer Ingelheim amended the agreement. Effective January 1, 2006, Abbott no longer distributes or records sales for the Boehringer Ingelheim 35 products, but will continue to co promote one product, Micardis, through March 31, 2006, and will receive residual commissions on Boehringer Ingelheims sales of the three products. The amount of pretax income under the amended agreement will be the same as expected under the previous agreement. Net sales of Boehringer Ingelheim products in 2005 were approximately $2.3 billion. In the second quarter 2004, the FDA granted approval for generic competition to Synthroid and generic competitors have entered the market. In 2004 and 2005, clarithromycin became subject to generic competition in several European markets. International segment sales of clarithromycin in 2005 were $760 million. In the U.S., the Pharmaceutical Products segment markets clarithromycin in two forms, the immediate release and the extended release forms, both of which are covered by additional non composition of matter patents. In May 2005, the composition of matter patent on clarithromycin in the U.S. expired, and several immediate release generic products were launched by competitors. Manufacturers of the extended release forms of clarithromycin were enjoined from entering the U.S. market due to Abbotts non composition of matter patents. U.S. sales of clarithromycin in 2005 and 2004 were $306 million and $458 million, respectively. There may be further generic competition for clarithromycin in the U.S. and other countries in 2006 depending on the results of legal proceedings related to the patents. Upon the December 2005 expiration of a court order related to licenses for sevoflurane, Baxter is now permitted to market a competitive form of sevoflurane. In addition, sevoflurane has been subject to generic competition from other competitors in isolated markets outside of the U.S. and further generic competition in international markets is possible. Worldwide sales of sevoflurane in 2005 were $874 million. The composition of matter patent for Omnicef expires in May 2007. Abbott holds an additional non composition of matter patent that expires in 2011. The Pharmaceutical Products segment sales of Omnicef in 2005 were $495 million. In mid 2006, the Ross segments co promotion agreement for Synagis will terminate. U.S. co promotion revenues were $231 million in 2005. Abbott will continue to market Synagis, and will market its follow on product, Numax, in select international markets and will receive residual commissions on U.S. sales of Synagis. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 52.4 percent of net sales in 2005, 54.9 percent in 2004 and 55.0 percent in 2003. The decrease in the gross profit margin in 2005 was due to unfavorable product mix, primarily as a result of increased sales of Boehringer Ingelheim products that have lower margins than other products in the Pharmaceutical Products segment. Restructuring charges, discussed below, reduced the gross profit margin in 2005 by 0.8 percentage points. The gross profit margin in 2004 was impacted by the favorable mix effect of exchange on the gross profit margin and by unfavorable product mix, primarily increased sales of lower margin Boehringer Ingelheim products, as discussed above, in the Pharmaceutical Products segment. The gross profit margin for 2003 was impacted by a charge of $88 million for an impairment of assets and other expenses as a result of a lower sales forecast for Abbokinase; partially offset by favorable product mix, resulting mainly from increased sales in the Pharmaceutical Products segment. Gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements, higher project expenses for new products, higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth, and the effects of inflation and competitive pricing pressures. In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. There are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products. These rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the Ross and Pharmaceutical Products segments. In addition, pricing pressures unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins for the Ross Products segment in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The gross profit margins for the Pharmaceutical Products segment were unfavorably impacted in 2005 and 2004 by unfavorable product mix and favorably impacted in 2003 by favorable product mix. The unfavorable product mix in 2005 and 2004 was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin Boehringer Ingelheim products and higher other manufacturing costs. The gross profit margin in 2003 for the Diagnostic Products segment was impacted by the effects of a FDA consent decree. 36 Research and development expense, excluding acquired in process research and development, was $1.8 billion in 2005, $1.7 billion in 2004 and $1.6 billion in 2003 and represented increases of 7.3 percent in 2005, 4.5 percent in 2004 and 10.1 percent in 2003. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11.7 percent in 2005 compared to increases of 2.4 percent in 2004 and 29.1 percent in 2003. The restructuring charges discussed below and an increase in a bad debt reserve associated with an unfavorable court ruling increased the percent change from 2004 by 2.7 percentage points in 2005. In 2003, Abbott recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, a pretax charge of $614 million related to the settlement of the Ross enteral nutritional investigation. This 2003 charge reduced the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses by 15.0 percentage points for 2004 and increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 16.5 percentage points over 2002. The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding the restructuring charges and the charge for the investigation, were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products, including commercial activities related to sales force expansion and product launches, including Abbotts carotid stent and new HUMIRA indications. These increases also reflect the effects of the acquisitions of TheraSense and EAS in 2004. Increases in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the Pharmaceutical Products and International segments. Restructurings (dollars in millions) In 2005, Abbott management approved plans to realign its global manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial operations. In 2005, Abbott recorded pretax charges against earnings of approximately $256 reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $174 is classified as cost of products sold, $10 as research and development and $72 as selling, general and administrative. An additional $14 was subsequently recorded in 2005 relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. As a result of product re registration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries, manufacturing related realignments are expected to continue into 2007. The following summarizes the restructuring activity for the global pharmaceutical manufacturing operations restructuring: Employee Related and Other Asset Impairments Total 2005 restructuring charges $ 44.1 $ 52.7 $ 96.8 Payments and impairments (0.3 ) (52.7 ) (53.0 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2005 $ 43.8 $ $ 43.8 The following summarizes the restructuring activity for all other restructurings, which are individually not material: Employee Related and Other Asset Impairments Total 2005 restructuring charges $ 147.6 $ 11.1 $ 158.7 Payments and impairments (36.6 ) (11.1 ) (47.7 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2005 $ 111.0 $ $ 111.0 37 Abbott expects to incur up to an additional $150 in future periods for restructuring plans, primarily for accelerated depreciation and plant and equipment dispositions. (Income) from TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. Joint Venture Abbotts income from the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture was lower in 2005 and 2004 compared to 2003 due to decreased sales due to market contraction for prescription proton pump inhibitors, and in 2004 by approximately $40 million as a result of an agreement with plaintiffs to settle litigation. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased in 2005 and 2004 due to the impact of higher interest rates on debt levels, partially offset by higher interest income. Net interest expense decreased in 2003 due to a lower level of borrowings and lower interest rates. Taxes on Earnings The effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were 27.0 percent in 2005, 23.0 percent in 2004 and 26.1 percent in 2003. In 2005, Abbott remitted $4.3 billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and recorded additional tax expense of $245 million, which increased the effective tax rate by approximately 5.3 percentage points. This was partially offset by adjustments of prior years tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years accrual requirements, which decreased the effective tax rate by 2.3 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2004 reflects adjustments of prior years tax requirements primarily as a result of resolutions of prior years tax audits and the effect of non deductible acquired in process research and development. The effect of these items for 2004 was to decrease the effective tax rate by approximately 1.2 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2003 includes the effect of the charge for the settlement of the Ross enteral nutritional investigation and the charges for acquired in process research and development. The effect of these charges for 2003 was to increase the effective tax rate by approximately 2.4 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of between 23.5 percent and 24.0 percent in 2006. Spin off of Abbotts Core Hospital Products Business On April 12, 2004, Abbotts Board of Directors declared a special dividend distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Hospira, Inc., payable on April 30, 2004. Hospira included the operations relating to the manufacture and sale of hospital products including specialty injectable pharmaceuticals, medication delivery systems and critical care devices and injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing. Hospira included Abbotts Hospital Products segment, after that segments reorganization on January 1, 2004, and portions of Abbotts International segment. The income and cash flows of Hospira and the direct transaction costs of the spin off have been presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Statement of Cash Flows. Prior years balance sheets have not been adjusted to reflect the effect of the spin off. The legal transfer of certain remaining operations and assets (net of liabilities) outside the United States is expected to occur in the first half of 2006. These operations and assets are used in the conduct of Hospiras international business and Hospira is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets. These assets and liabilities have been presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The assets and liabilities held for sale consist primarily of inventories, trade accounts receivable, equipment and trade accounts payable, salaries and other accruals. Abbott has retained liabilities for taxes on income prior to the spin off, defined benefit, post employment medical and dental plan obligations and assets, as of the spin off, for most of Hospiras 38 U.S. retired employees and U.S. retirement eligible employees and certain potential liabilities, if any, related to alleged improper pricing practices prior to the spin off in connection with federal, state and private reimbursement for certain drugs. Business Combinations and Technology Acquisitions In 2005, Abbott acquired the remaining interest in a small medical products company that was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting and a less than 50 percent equity interest in a small medical products company. The aggregate cash purchase price was approximately $25 million. Acquisition accounting resulted in the recording of non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $69 million, intangible assets of approximately $22 million and a charge of approximately $17 million for acquired in process research and development. In 2005, Abbott acquired additional rights related to HUMIRA for approximately $270 million, which will be amortized over 13 years. In 2004, Abbott paid approximately $2.3 billion for strategic business and technology acquisitions, as follows. Abbott acquired TheraSense, Inc., a leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self monitoring systems, for approximately $1.2 billion in cash; i STAT Corporation, a manufacturer of point of care diagnostic products for blood analysis, for approximately $394 million in cash; EAS, a nutritional company with a portfolio of nationally recognized brands, for approximately $320 million in cash; and Spine Next, a manufacturer of orthopedic spinal implant devices, for approximately $58 million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to $23 million upon achievement of future targets. Abbott also acquired certain other product technologies for approximately $352 million. These acquisitions resulted in a charge of $271 million for acquired in process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $1.3 billion, non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $923 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $406 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily trade names, are amortized over 5 to 20 years (average of approximately 14 years). In 2003, Abbott paid approximately $459 million for strategic business and technology acquisitions, as follows. Abbott acquired ZonePerfect Nutrition Company, a marketer of healthy and nutritious products for active people, for approximately $160 million in cash; Integrated Vascular Systems, Inc., a developer of a novel vessel closure technology, for approximately $65 million in cash; and Spinal Concepts Inc., a marketer of spinal fixation products used in the treatment of spinal disorders, diseases and injuries, for approximately $166 million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to $40 million if agreed upon targets are met. Abbott also acquired the assets of JOMED N.V.s coronary and peripheral interventional business for approximately $68 million in cash. These acquisitions resulted in a charge of approximately $100 million for acquired in process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $222 million and non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $182 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product technology, are amortized over 9 to 25 years (average of approximately 16 years). Had the above acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. In early 2006, Abbott agreed to acquire Guidants interventional vascular and endovascular solutions businesses for $4.1 billion in connection with Boston Scientifics acquisition of Guidant. Abbott would also pay $250 million each upon government approvals to market Guidants drug eluting stent in the U.S. and in Japan. In addition, Abbott agreed to provide Boston Scientific a $900 million 4 percent loan and to acquire $1.4 billion of Boston Scientific common stock directly from Boston Scientific contingent upon the closing of the Guidant acquisition. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of 2006. 39 Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to $5.0 billion, $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, $641 million, $482 million and $200 million, respectively, was contributed to the main domestic defined benefit plan. In addition, Abbott transferred approximately $45 million to Hospira in 2004 in accordance with the employee benefit agreement governing the assumption by Hospira of certain defined benefit plan assets and liabilities. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan in 2006 to 2011 to be between $200 million and $400 million annually. The increased contribution in 2005 was due, in part, to the investment of cash remitted under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2005, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard and Poors and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit of $3.0 billion, which support domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements. Subsequent to the announced potential acquisition of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, Standard and Poors affirmed their current debt ratings for Abbott and maintained their current "stable" outlook. Moodys Investors Service indicated they would likely affirm their current debt ratings for Abbott and would likely change their current outlook from "stable" to "negative." In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 50 million shares of Abbotts common stock from time to time and no shares were purchased under this authorization in 2004. In 2005, Abbott purchased approximately 30 million of its common shares under this authorization at a cost of approximately $1.3 billion. In 2004 and 2003, Abbott purchased approximately 11.7 million and 2.7 million, respectively, of its common shares at a cost of approximately $500 million and $98 million, respectively, under a prior authorization. In 2005, Abbott borrowed $1.9 billion of long term debt that matures in May 2008 with variable interest rates above LIBOR. Proceeds from this debt were invested in short term investments. Abbott issued $1.5 billion of long term debt in 2004 that matures in 2009 through 2014 with interest rates ranging from 3.5 percent to 4.35 percent. Proceeds from this debt were used to fund the acquisition of TheraSense and to pay down domestic commercial paper borrowings. Abbott retained $700 million of proceeds from borrowings that Hospira assumed as a result of the spin off and used these proceeds to reduce domestic commercial paper borrowings. In addition, Abbott retired long term debt of $1.65 billion in 2004 with proceeds from domestic commercial paper borrowings. Working Capital Working capital was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2005, $3.9 billion at December 31, 2004 and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2003. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.2 billion in 2005, $1.3 billion in 2004 and $1.1 billion in 2003 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments placed with customers. 40 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005. Payment Due By Period Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt, including current maturities and future interest payments $ 7,237 $ 2,080 $ 3,036 $ 730 $ 1,391 Operating lease obligations 348 86 119 57 86 Capitalized auto lease obligations 106 35 71 Purchase commitments (a) 1,454 1,311 99 32 12 Other long term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet Benefit plan obligations 1,275 208 217 850 Other 1,305 393 208 704 Total $ 11,725 $ 3,512 $ 3,926 $ 1,244 $ 3,043 (a)Purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. Contingent Obligations Abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, with other companies which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. In addition, Abbott periodically acquires small companies in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds. As previously noted, in connection with the potential acquisition of certain Guidant businesses, Abbott has agreed to acquire up to $6.9 billion of assets, comprised of $4.1 billion for the businesses, up to $500 million in milestone payments, a $900 million loan to Boston Scientific, and $1.4 billion of Boston Scientific common stock. In connection with the spin off of Hospira, Abbott has retained liabilities for taxes on income prior to the spin off and certain potential liabilities, if any, related to alleged improper pricing practices in connection with federal, state and private reimbursement for certain drugs. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In 2006, Abbott must adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment," which requires that the fair value of stock options granted to employees be recorded in the results of operations. Abbott will use the modified prospective method of adoption. Under this method, prior years financial results will not include the impact of recording stock options using fair value. Footnote 10 quantifies the effect of application of fair value to 2005 and prior awards. Based upon the valuation of stock options granted in the 2006 annual grant, which comprise the majority of the grant activity for the year, Abbott estimates the impact of the 2006 change in stock compensation expense on diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.15, which includes $0.14 per diluted share for the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options. The 2006 expense for stock compensation is dependent on the number of options granted in the future, the terms of those awards and their fair value, and therefore, the effect on diluted earnings per share could change. 41 In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections." This statement generally requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principles. Under the prior rules, changes in accounting principles were generally recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. This statement does not change the previous requirements for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements, change in accounting estimate or justification of a change in accounting principle on the basis of preferability. This statement is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Adoption of the provisions of the statement is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of Abbott. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs." This statement clarifies the accounting for the abnormal amount of idle facilities expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. This statement requires that those items be recognized as current period expense. In addition the statement requires that allocation of fixed overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. This statement is effective for inventory costs incurred after December 31, 2005. Adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on the financial statements of Abbott. Legislative Issues Abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation. Abbott expects debate to continue in the U.S. at both the federal and the state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. Abbott believes that if further legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing access to health care products and services, or reducing prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services. International operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors on Form 10 K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbotts operations are discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 42   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $3.1 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt due July 2006 through March 2014. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. As of December 31, 2004, Abbott had $1.6 billion of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average annual interest rate of 2.2% with an average remaining life of 38 days. The fair market value of long term debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004 amounted to $6.4 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 4.2% and 4.3%, respectively) with maturities through 2023. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair market value of current and long term investment securities amounted to $80 million and $854 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or market values. (A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in rates.) Market Price Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott maintains a portfolio of available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions. The market value of these investments was approximately $99 million and $96 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2005 by approximately $20 million. (A 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in share prices.) Non Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott maintains a portfolio of equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $17 million and $30 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. No individual investment is in excess of $9 million. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked to market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Abbott held $3.9 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the following calendar year. In addition, certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next calendar year. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Abbott held $222 million and $984 million, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the following calendar year. 43 The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004: 2005 2004 Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) (dollars in millions) Receive primarily U.S. Dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 1,519 1.184 $ (1.4 ) $ 1,688 1.284 $ (39.1 ) British Pound 1,148 1.738 7.2 1,112 1.845 (26.7 ) Japanese Yen 513 113.4 (18.4 ) 533 107.3 9.2 Canadian Dollar 425 1.176 (2.1 ) 301 1.274 (20.0 ) All other currencies 487 N/A 601 N/A (3.3 ) Total $ 4,092 $ (14.7 ) $ 4,235 $ (79.9 ) 44
