ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbotts products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales. Abbotts primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals, nutritional products, vascular products and diagnostic testing products. Abbott also owns 50 percent of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. that Abbott accounts for on the equity method. The worldwide launch of HUMIRA, the acquisition of Guidants vascular business, the amendment of the Boehringer Ingelheim agreement, and the loss of patent protection for some pharmaceutical products have impacted Abbotts sales, costs and financial position over the last three years. Pharmaceutical research and development is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology, oncology, neuroscience, metabolism, and viral diseases. In 2003, Abbott began the worldwide launch of HUMIRA, which increased its worldwide sales to $2.0 billion in 2006 compared to $1.4 billion in 2005. Substantial research and development and selling support has been and continues to be dedicated to maximizing the worldwide potential of HUMIRA. In December 2006, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals which complements Abbotts existing franchise in the dyslipidemia market and strengthens the late stage and mid term pharmaceutical pipeline with opportunities in cholesterol management, asthma and inhaled insulin. In 2005, Abbott and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) amended their agreement whereby Abbott distributed and promoted BI products. Effective January 1, 2006, Abbott no longer distributed or recorded sales for distribution activities for the BI products. Abbotts gross margins for BI products from the prior agreement in effect through December 31, 2005 were substantially lower than its average gross margins. Sales of BI products were $150 million and $2.3 billion in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, increased generic competition resulted in worldwide sales of clarithromycin declining 23 percent in 2006. In 2005 and 2006, Abbotts nutritional products businesses were reorganized into a worldwide business to better leverage the opportunities available for strong nutritional brands. Significant efforts have been focused on capturing those opportunities, particularly in developing markets. In April 2006, Abbott acquired Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and began to integrate it with Abbotts vascular business. The acquisition significantly improved Abbotts competitive position in this business that is characterized by rapid innovation. In 2006, Abbott received European Union approval to market the XIENCE V drug eluting stent. Abbotts diagnostic segment is comprised of four separate divisions immunoassay/hematology, diabetes care, molecular, and point of care. In early 2004, Abbott acquired TheraSense for $1.2 billion, and began to integrate it with Abbotts diabetes care business. In January 2007, Abbott announced that it had agreed to sell its core laboratory diagnostics business, including Abbott Point of Care, to GE for $8.13 billion in cash. Abbott expects the sale to close in the first half of 2007. Abbotts Molecular Diagnostics and Diabetes Care businesses are not part of this transaction and will remain part of Abbott. Abbotts short and long term debt totaled $12.4 billion at December 31, 2006, largely incurred to finance recent acquisitions. Operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have allowed Abbott to fund acquisitions over the last three years. At December 31, 2006, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard and Poors Corporation and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. 27 In 2007, Abbott will focus on several key initiatives. In the pharmaceutical business, Abbott will continue the launch of newly approved indications for HUMIRA, and will also focus on the integration of Kos Pharmaceuticals into the Pharmaceutical Products segment. Pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to focus on the therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new HUMIRA indications. Abbott expects to submit additional pharmaceutical regulatory filings in 2007. In the vascular business, Abbott will continue the launch of the Xience V drug eluting stent in Europe, and will launch in the U.S. upon approval by the FDA. For diabetes care, Abbott anticipates the approval of FreeStyle Navigator. Effort will also be required for the sale and separation of Abbotts core laboratory and point of care diagnostics businesses. In the other business segments, Abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets. Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates Approximately 40 percent of Abbotts consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances are in the Pharmaceutical Products segment and the Nutritional Products segment. Abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies, to state agencies that administer the federal Medicaid and Medicare programs and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to 24 months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted to approximately $2.6 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, or 23.2 percent, 22.9 percent and 25.6 percent, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $11.0 billion, $10.9 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales and operating earnings by approximately $110 million in 2006. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $247 million, $284 million and $233 million for cash discounts in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $209 million, $162 million and $163 million for returns in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbotts historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel. Management internally estimates the inventory in the retail channel that is not on the retail shelf. A third party continuously measures time on the retail shelf, which is a relatively significant portion of the time inventory is in the distribution channel. Except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data. In addition, internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual. In the WIC business, the state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable price, is reliably estimable. Estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott has the WIC business. External data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the 28 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers the WIC program, participant data from some of the states, and internally administered market surveys. The USDA has been making its data available for many years. Internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data. At December 31, 2006, Abbott had the exclusive WIC business in 11 states. In the domestic pharmaceutical business, the most significant charges against gross sales are for Medicaid and Medicare Rebates, Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates and Wholesaler Chargebacks. In order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances, management uses both internal and external estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time. External data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by Abbott. Management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data. To estimate the price rebate percentage, systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price. Abbotts systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant, and Abbott believes they are reliable. The following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals, which comprise approximately 76 percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2006. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (dollars in thousands) Domestic Pharmaceutical Products Domestic Nutritionals WIC Rebates Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at January 1, 2004 $ 113,362 $ 229,070 $ 145,195 $ 37,093 Provisions 671,817 596,330 279,681 419,486 Payments (687,132 ) (452,342 ) (271,078 ) (412,526 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 98,047 373,058 153,798 44,053 Provisions 641,189 663,043 253,499 450,901 Payments (644,460 ) (581,098 ) (273,166 ) (446,867 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 94,776 455,003 134,131 48,087 Provisions 636,849 527,860 281,221 532,847 Payments (595,477 ) (533,632 ) (246,456 ) (513,905 ) Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 136,148 $ 449,231 $ 168,896 $ 67,029 Adjustments for prior years rebate accruals have not been material. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For Medicaid, Medicare and other government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. Income Taxes Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items are often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. As part of Abbotts calculation of the provision for taxes on earnings, Abbott records the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits. Each quarter, Abbott reviews its exposures in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In the U.S., Abbotts federal income tax returns through 2003 are settled, and the income tax returns for years after 2003 are open. Except for taxes on dividends that were remitted under the 29 American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries. On January 1, 2007, Abbott must adopt the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes which changes the measurement of tax contingencies. Under this Interpretation, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. This Interpretation will result in significantly more effort to assess tax uncertainties than was required under SFAS No. 5, and may result in initial recording of tax expense that exceeds the expected resolution of tax uncertainties. The adoption of this Interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on Abbotts January 1, 2007 balance sheet or the 2007 provision for income taxes. Pension and Post Employment Benefits Abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate, discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were determined based on high quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. Prior to December 31, 2005, the discount rate was determined by reference to a composite corporate AA bond index. The health care cost trend rate represents Abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for decades, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Recent low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2006, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for Abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were $1.4 billion and $537 million, respectively. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits. Differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period. Footnote 4 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point. On December 31, 2006, Abbott adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. The provisions of this statement require the immediate recognition of the deferrals on the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Adoption of this statement on December 31, 2006 resulted in a decrease in Abbotts shareholders equity of approximately $1.3 billion. Valuation of Intangible Assets Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles. Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or 30 when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs. At December 31, 2006 goodwill and intangibles amounted to $9.4 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $575 million in 2006. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2006, 2005 or 2004. At December 31, 2006 the valuations for the Guidant and Kos acquisitions have not been finalized. Litigation Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Under SFAS No. 5, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Except for one group of cases relating to pharmaceutical pricing for which Abbott is unable to estimate a loss, if any, Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $165 million to $295 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Reserves of approximately $200 million have been recorded at December 31, 2006 for these proceedings and exposures. These reserves represent managements best estimate of probable loss, as defined by SFAS No. 5. Stock Compensation Through December 31, 2005, Abbott measured compensation cost using the intrinsic value based method of accounting for stock options granted to employees and disclosed the impact of the fair value method in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2006, Abbott adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which requires that fair value be recorded in the results of operations. Since there is no market for trading employee stock options, management must use a fair value method. There is no certainty that the results of a fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash. Fair value methods require management to make several assumptions, the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model, stock price volatility and the average life of an option. Abbott has readily available grant by grant historical activity for several years in its option administration system that it uses in developing some of its assumptions. Abbott uses the Black Scholes method to value stock options. The results of the Black Scholes model are periodically compared to the binomial model and the results have been comparable. Abbott uses both historical volatility of its stock price and the implied volatility of currently traded options to develop the volatility assumptions. Abbott uses the historical grant activity, combined with expectations about future exercise activity, to develop the average life assumptions. Abbott has also used the historical grant data to evaluate whether certain holders of stock options exercised their options differently than other holders and has not found any differentiating pattern among holders. Abbott quantified the additional paid in capital amount available for use in determining tax effects of early exercise for measurement of tax expense. Abbott used the modified prospective method of adoption. Under this method, prior years financial results do not include the impact of recording stock options using fair value. Footnote 9 quantifies the effect in 2005 and 2004 had compensation cost been determined using the fair value method. 31 Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last three years: Total % Components of Change % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2006 vs. 2005 0.6 (a) 0.6 0.2 (0.2 ) 2005 vs. 2004 13.5 0.1 12.1 1.3 2004 vs. 2003 13.9 1.6 9.1 3.2 Total U.S. 2006 vs. 2005 (7.5 )(a) 2.4 (9.9 ) 2005 vs. 2004 13.0 0.8 12.2 2004 vs. 2003 12.8 3.8 9.0 Total International 2006 vs. 2005 10.9 (1.3 ) 12.7 (0.5 ) 2005 vs. 2004 14.2 (0.7 ) 12.0 2.9 2004 vs. 2003 15.3 (1.0 ) 8.9 7.4 Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2006 vs. 2005 (9.5 )(a) 1.8 (11.0 ) (0.3 ) 2005 vs. 2004 14.9 0.6 13.0 1.3 2004 vs. 2003 16.2 3.2 9.6 3.4 Diagnostic Products Segment 2006 vs. 2005 5.9 (1.7 ) 8.1 (0.5 ) 2005 vs. 2004 11.2 (0.7 ) 9.9 2.0 2004 vs. 2003 11.1 (1.2 ) 6.9 5.4 Nutritional Products Segment 2006 vs. 2005 9.6 (0.4 ) 9.7 0.3 2005 vs. 2004 9.7 (0.5 ) 9.4 0.8 2004 vs. 2003 10.2 (0.1 ) 8.9 1.4 Vascular Products Segment 2006 vs. 2005 327.7 (4.6 ) 333.2 (0.9 ) 2005 vs. 2004 14.7 (0.4 ) 14.5 0.6 2004 vs. 2003 19.3 (1.7 ) 21.0 (a) The Pharmaceutical Products segment had an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) to co promote and distribute three of its products in the U.S. In 2005, Abbott and BI amended the agreement and effective January 1, 2006, Abbott no longer distributed or recorded sales for distribution activities for the BI products. The increases in sales for 2006 excluding BI products were 11.6 percent for total net sales, 12.3 percent for total U.S. sales and 7.8 percent for Pharmaceutical Products segment sales. 32 A comparison of significant product group sales is as follows. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. 2006 Percent Change 2005 Percent Change 2004 Percent Change (dollars in millions) Pharmaceuticals U.S. Specialty $ 3,505 25 $ 2,799 16 $ 2,410 26 U.S. Primary Care 2,505 2 2,463 2,466 12 International Pharmaceuticals 5,157 8 4,776 14 4,202 18 Diagnostics Immunoassay 2,272 4 2,187 2 2,141 2 Diabetes Care 1,136 6 1,067 35 791 46 Nutritionals U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals 1,128 3 1,097 (4 ) 1,146 5 International Pediatric Nutritionals 899 29 698 17 598 13 U.S. Adult Nutritionals 1,097 2 1,077 15 934 15 International Adult Nutritionals 785 10 716 8 665 13 Increased sales volume of HUMIRA and increased volume and price for Kaletra and Depakote favorably impacted U.S. Specialty sales. Increased sales volume for TriCor and Omnicef favorably impacted U.S. Primary Care sales and were partially offset by lower U.S. sales of Biaxin due primarily to generic competition for the immediate release formulation. U.S. sales of Biaxin were $151 million, $306 million and $458 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Increased sales volume of HUMIRA favorably impacted International Pharmaceuticals sales, partially offset by decreased sales volume in 2006 due to generic competition for clarithromycin. Diabetes Care product sales growth in 2005 and 2004 was favorably impacted by the acquisition of TheraSense in the second quarter of 2004. The decrease in sales of U.S. pediatric nutritionals in 2005 was primarily due to overall infant nutritionals non WIC category decline and competitive share loss. International Pediatric Nutritionals sales increases were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries. U.S. Adult Nutritionals sales in 2005 and 2004 were favorably impacted by the acquisition of EAS in the fourth quarter of 2004. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were $199 million in 2006, $177 million in 2005 and $144 million in 2004. The expiration of licenses, patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. Significant ongoing generic activities, and significant patent and license expirations in the next three years are as follows. The U.S. composition of matter patent for Depakote expires in 2008. Abbott holds non composition of matter patents on the extended release form of Depakote. U.S. sales of Depakote in 2006 were $1.2 billion. In 2004, the FDA granted approval for generic competition to Synthroid and generic competitors have entered the market. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $470 million in 2006 and $498 million in 2005. Clarithromycin is now subject to generic competition in most European markets. European market sales of clarithromycin in 2006 and 2005 were $329 million and $416 million, respectively. In the U.S., clarithromycin is marketed in two forms, the immediate release and the extended release forms. In May 2005, the composition of matter patent on clarithromycin expired, and several immediate release generic products were launched by competitors. Abbott holds non composition of matter patents for the extended release form of clarithromycin. In December 2006, an extended release generic product was launched by a competitor. The U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois has denied Abbotts request for grant of a temporary restraining order against the competitor. There may 33 be further generic competition for clarithromycin in other countries in 2007 depending on the results of legal proceedings related to the patents. Upon the December 2005 expiration of a court order related to licenses for sevoflurane, Baxter is now permitted to market a competitive form of sevoflurane. In addition, sevoflurane has been subject to generic competition from other competitors in isolated markets outside of the U.S. and further generic competition in international markets is possible. Worldwide sales of sevoflurane in 2006 and 2005 were $799 million and $874 million, respectively. The composition of matter patent for Omnicef expires in May 2007. Abbott holds an additional non composition of matter patent for Omnicef. Sales of Omnicef in 2006 and 2005 were $637 million and $495 million, respectively. The Pharmaceutical Products segment markets all of the above products. The patent for Prevacid, which is licensed by TAP Pharmaceuticals (TAP), expires in 2009. Abbott records TAPs results on the equity method. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 56.3 percent of net sales in 2006, 52.4 percent in 2005 and 54.9 percent in 2004. The increase in the gross profit margin in 2006 was due to favorable product mix, primarily as a result of decreased sales of Boehringer Ingelheim products that have lower margins than for other products in the Pharmaceutical Products segment and the decrease in the gross profit margin in 2005 was due to unfavorable product mix, primarily as a result of increased sales of Boehringer Ingelheim products. Restructuring charges, discussed below, reduced the gross profit margins in 2006 and 2005 by 1.1 percentage points and 0.8 percentage points, respectively. The gross profit margin in 2004 was impacted by the favorable mix effect of exchange on the gross profit margin and by unfavorable product mix, primarily increased sales of lower margin Boehringer Ingelheim products in the Pharmaceutical Products segment. Gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements, higher project expenses for new products, higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth and the effects of inflation. In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. There are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products. These rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the Nutritional and Pharmaceutical Products segments. In addition, pricing pressures unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins for the Nutritional Products segment in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The gross profit margins for the Pharmaceutical Products segment were favorably impacted in 2006 and unfavorably impacted in 2005 and 2004 by product mix. The favorable product mix in 2006 was due to decreased sales of lower margin Boehringer Ingelheim products and the unfavorable product mix in 2005 and 2004 was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin Boehringer Ingelheim products and higher other manufacturing costs. Research and development expense, excluding acquired in process and collaborations research and development, was $2.3 billion in 2006, $1.8 billion in 2005 and $1.7 billion in 2004 and represented increases of 23.8 percent in 2006, 7.3 percent in 2005 and 4.5 percent in 2004. The effect of recording compensation expense relating to share based awards and additional costs associated with Abbotts decision to discontinue the commercial development of the ZoMaxx drug eluting stent increased research and development expenses by 6.3 percentage points over 2005. The remaining increase was due to the acquisition of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and increased spending to support pipeline programs, including follow on indications for HUMIRA, and other late stage clinical programs in pharmaceuticals, diabetes care and vascular. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15.5 percent in 2006 compared to increases of 11.7 percent in 2005 and 2.4 percent in 2004. 2006 includes the effect of recording compensation expense 34 relating to share based awards, a philanthropic contribution to the Abbott Fund and the acquisition of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses. These items increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 8.6 percentage points over 2005. The restructuring charges discussed below and an increase in a bad debt reserve associated with an unfavorable court ruling increased the percent change from 2004 by 2.7 percentage points in 2005. In 2003, Abbott recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, a pretax charge of $614 million related to a settlement. This 2003 charge reduced the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses by 15.0 percentage points for 2004. The remaining increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products, including continued spending for HUMIRA, as well as spending on other marketed pharmaceutical products. These increases also reflect the effects of the acquisitions of TheraSense and EAS in 2004. Increases in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the Pharmaceutical Products segment. Restructurings (dollars in millions) In 2006 and 2005, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2006 and 2005, Abbott recorded pretax charges against earnings of approximately $210 and $256, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $181 and $174, respectively, is classified as cost of products sold, $29 and $10, respectively, as research and development and $72, in 2005, as selling, general and administrative. An additional $70 and $14 were subsequently recorded in 2006 and 2005, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. As a result of product re registration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries, manufacturing related realignments are expected to continue into 2007. The following summarizes the activity for restructurings: Employee Related and Other Asset Impairments Total 2005 restructuring charges $ 191.7 $ 63.8 $ 255.5 Payments and impairments (36.9 ) (63.8 ) (100.7 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2005 154.8 154.8 2006 restructuring charges 117.7 92.6 210.3 Payments, impairments and other adjustments (79.2 ) (92.6 ) (171.8 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2006 $ 193.3 $ $ 193.3 Abbott expects to incur up to an additional $128 in future periods for restructuring plans, primarily for accelerated depreciation. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased in 2006 due primarily to higher borrowings as a result of the acquisition of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, and Abbotts investments in the common stock of Boston Scientific and a note receivable; partially offset by higher interest income. Other (income) expense, net The increase in Other (income) expense in 2006 is primarily due to fair value gain adjustments to certain derivative financial instruments related to the investment in Boston Scientific common stock. 35 Taxes on Earnings The effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were 24.6 percent in 2006, 27.0 percent in 2005 and 23.0 percent in 2004. Taxes on earnings in 2006 reflect the effect of the tax rates applied to acquired in process and collaborations research and development and the resolution of prior years income tax audits and the effect of discrete tax events. For 2006, the tax rates applied to acquired in process and collaborations research and development increased the effective tax rate by 6.6 percentage points and the effect of the income tax audit resolution and discrete tax events decreased the effective tax rate by 5.5 percentage points. In 2005, Abbott remitted $4.3 billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and recorded additional tax expense of $245 million, which increased the effective tax rate by approximately 5.3 percentage points. This was partially offset by adjustments of prior years tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years accrual requirements, which decreased the effective tax rate by 2.3 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2004 reflects adjustments of prior years tax requirements primarily as a result of resolutions of prior years tax audits and the effect of non deductible acquired in process research and development. The effect of these items for 2004 was to decrease the effective tax rate by approximately 1.2 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of approximately 22.5 percent in 2007. Spin off of Abbotts Core Hospital Products Business In 2004, Abbotts Board of Directors declared a special dividend distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Hospira, Inc., payable on April 30, 2004. Hospira included the operations relating to the manufacture and sale of hospital products including specialty injectable pharmaceuticals, medication delivery systems and critical care devices and injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing. Hospira included Abbotts Hospital Products segment, after that segments reorganization on January 1, 2004, and portions of the former International segment. The income and cash flows of Hospira and the direct transaction costs of the spin off have been presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Statement of Cash Flows. Abbott has retained liabilities for taxes on income prior to the spin off, defined benefit, post employment medical and dental plan obligations and assets, as of the spin off, for most of Hospiras U.S. retired employees and U.S. retirement eligible employees and certain potential liabilities, if any, related to alleged improper pricing practices prior to the spin off in connection with federal, state and private reimbursement for certain drugs. Business Combinations, Technology Acquisitions and Related Transactions In December 2006, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. for cash of approximately $3.8 billion, net of cash held by Kos Pharmaceuticals, to expand Abbotts presence in the lipid management market and to provide several on market and late stage pipeline products. Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and markets proprietary medications for the treatment of chronic cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory diseases. This business was acquired on December 13, 2006 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. The acquisition was financed primarily with short term debt. The preliminary allocation of the acquisition cost is shown in the table below (in millions of dollars). Goodwill, primarily non deductible $ 1,824 Acquired in process research and development 1,262 Acquired intangible assets, primarily product rights for marketed products 821 Acquired net tangible assets 97 Deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition (234 ) Total preliminary allocation of acquisition cost $ 3,770 36 Acquired intangible assets will be amortized over 1 to 15 years. Non deductible acquired in process research and development was charged to income in 2006. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of trade accounts receivable, inventories and property and equipment, net of assumed liabilities, primarily accrued salaries and wages and other liabilities. In order to expand Abbotts presence in the growing vascular market, Abbott acquired Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses for approximately $4.1 billion, in cash, in connection with Boston Scientifics acquisition of Guidant. These businesses were acquired on April 21, 2006 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. In addition, Abbott will also pay to Boston Scientific $250 million each upon government approvals to market the XIENCE V drug eluting stent in the U.S. and in Japan. Each $250 million payment will result in the recording of additional goodwill. The preliminary allocation of the acquisition cost is shown in the table below (in millions of dollars). The valuation of intellectual property, including intangible assets and acquired in process research and development, is substantially complete, but the valuations of the other assets and liabilities are preliminary. The allocation will be finalized when certain information regarding the other assets and liabilities is known. Goodwill, primarily deductible $ 1,688 Acquired intangible assets, primarily product rights for marketed products 1,195 Acquired in process research and development 665 Acquired net tangible assets 580 Total preliminary allocation of acquisition cost $ 4,128 Acquired intangible assets will be amortized over 3 to 15 years (average of approximately 10 years). Tax deductible acquired in process research and development was charged to income in 2006. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of property and equipment of approximately $530 million, trade accounts receivable of approximately $250 million and inventories of approximately $120 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, litigation reserves and other liabilities. In order to facilitate Boston Scientifics acquisition of Guidant, Abbott also acquired 64.6 million shares of Boston Scientific common stock directly from Boston Scientific and loaned $900 million to a wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific. Abbott is required to dispose of the shares by October 2008. Sales of the shares are limited to approximately 5.4 million shares per month until October 2007. The amount recorded upon the acquisition of the shares includes a discount to market, based on an appraisal, to reflect the value of the restrictions on sale. On the date of acquisition, half of the shares were recorded as available for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115 and the remainder under the cost method in accordance with APB No. 18. As of December 31, 2006, all of the shares are recorded as available for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115. The loan, which is due in April 2011, is guaranteed by Boston Scientific and bears a favorable effective interest rate of 4 percent, which is reflected in the valuation of the note receivable. In connection with the acquisition of the shares, Boston Scientific is entitled to certain after tax gains upon Abbotts sale of the shares. Abbott would retain any gains on the sale of the Boston Scientific shares up to a sales price of $23.83; Boston Scientific would receive any after tax gains on the sale of the shares for the portion of the sales price in excess of $23.83 but lower than $26.00; and Boston Scientific would receive one half of any after tax gain for the portion of the sales price in excess of $25.99. Based on an appraisal, Abbott recorded approximately $114 million for this gain sharing derivative financial instrument liability. In addition, Boston Scientific agreed to reimburse Abbott for certain borrowing costs on debt incurred to acquire the Boston Scientific shares. After Abbott incurs the first $10 million of interest cost on debt incurred to acquire the shares, Boston Scientific will reimburse Abbott for the next $60 million of interest cost. Reimbursement for the incremental interest cost will be in the form of additional common stock of Boston Scientific, payable 18 months after the acquisition. Abbott recorded 37 approximately $55 million for this interest derivative financial instrument asset. The effect of recording the shares, the loan to Boston Scientific and the derivative financial instruments at fair value on the date of acquisition resulted in the recording of additional goodwill of approximately $204 million. The financial assets and liability acquired from Boston Scientific were valued and recorded at acquisition as follows (in millions of dollars): Boston Scientific common stock $ 1,326 Note receivable 829 Derivative financial instruments, net (59 ) Total $ 2,096 In 2005, Abbott acquired the remaining interest in a small medical products company that was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting and a less than 50 percent equity interest in a small medical products company. The aggregate cash purchase price was approximately $25 million. Acquisition accounting resulted in the recording of non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $69 million, intangible assets of approximately $22 million and a charge of approximately $17 million for acquired in process research and development. In 2005, Abbott acquired additional rights related to HUMIRA for approximately $270 million, which are being amortized over 13 years. In 2004, Abbott acquired TheraSense, Inc., a leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self monitoring systems, for approximately $1.2 billion in cash; i STAT Corporation, a manufacturer of point of care diagnostic products for blood analysis, for approximately $394 million in cash; EAS, a nutritional company with a portfolio of nationally recognized brands, for approximately $320 million in cash; and Spine Next, a manufacturer of orthopedic spinal implant devices, for approximately $58 million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to $23 million upon achievement of future targets. Abbott also acquired certain other product technologies for approximately $352 million. These acquisitions resulted in a charge of $271 million for acquired in process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $1.3 billion, non tax deductible goodwill of approximately $923 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $406 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily trade names, are amortized over 5 to 20 years (average of approximately 14 years). Had the above acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated net sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. 38 Subsequent Event Announced Sales of Businesses On January 18, 2007, Abbott announced that it had agreed to sell its core laboratory diagnostics business, including Abbott Point of Care, to GE for $8.13 billion in cash. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2007 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities included in the sale is estimated to be approximately $2.6 billion and net sales for these businesses were approximately $2.7 billion in 2006. Abbott estimates tax expense of approximately $2.0 billion will be recorded on the gain. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to $5.3 billion, $5.0 billion and $4.3 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is due to higher net earnings adjusted for after tax non cash charges for acquired in process research and development and share based compensation and higher contributions to retirement benefit plans in 2005 compared to 2006; partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2006, including tax payments related to the 2005 remittances of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, $200 million, $641 million and $482 million, respectively, was contributed to the main domestic defined benefit plan. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of $200 million annually. The increased contribution in 2005 was due, in part, to the investment of cash remitted under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2006, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard & Poors Corporation and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit of $7.0 billion, including a $4 billion short term facility, that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements. Subsequent to the announced potential acquisition of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc., Standard and Poors affirmed its current debt ratings for Abbott and maintained its current stable outlook and Moodys Investors Service affirmed its current debt ratings for Abbott and affirmed its current negative outlook. In October 2006, the board of directors authorized the purchase of $2.5 billion of Abbotts common shares from time to time and no shares were purchased under this authorization in 2006. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, Abbott purchased approximately 17.3 million, 30.0 million and 11.7 million, respectively, of its common shares under prior authorizations at a cost of approximately $755 million, $1.3 billion and $500 million, respectively. Under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2006, Abbott issued $4.0 billion of long term debt in 2006 that matures in 2009 through 2016 with interest rates ranging from 5.375 percent to 5.875 percent. Proceeds from this debt were used to pay down domestic commercial paper borrowings that were incurred to partially fund the acquisition of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses. The acquisition of Kos Pharmaceuticals was financed primarily with commercial paper borrowings. In addition, commercial paper borrowings were used to repay $1.9 billion of long term debt in 2006. In 2005, Abbott borrowed $1.9 billion of long term debt that matures in May 2008 with variable interest rates above LIBOR. In 2006, $1.6 billion of this debt was paid prior to maturity. In 2004, Abbott issued $1.5 billion of long term debt that matures in 2009 through 2014 with interest rates ranging from 3.5 percent to 4.35 percent. 39 Working Capital At December 31, 2006 current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately $669 million as a result of increased short term borrowings used to acquire Kos Pharmaceuticals in December 2006. Working capital was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2004. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.3 billion in 2006, $1.2 billion in 2005 and $1.3 billion in 2004 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments placed with customers. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. Payment Due By Period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long term debt, including current maturities and future interest payments $ 9,148 $ 432 $ 2,775 $ 2,564 $ 3,377 Operating lease obligations 404 80 121 80 123 Capitalized auto lease obligations 86 28 58 Purchase commitments (a) 2,751 2,574 130 36 11 Other long term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet Benefit plan obligations 1,964 279 312 1,373 Other 1,141 558 207 376 Total $15,494 $3,114 $3,921 $3,199 $5,260 (a) Purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. Contingent Obligations Abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, with other companies which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. In addition, Abbott periodically acquires small companies or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds. In connection with the acquisition of the common shares of Boston Scientific, Boston Scientific is entitled to certain after tax gains, if any, upon Abbotts sales of the Boston Scientific shares. In addition, Abbott has retained liabilities for taxes on income prior to the spin off of Hospira and certain potential liabilities, if any, related to alleged improper pricing practices in connection with federal, state and private reimbursement for certain drugs. 40 Recently Issued Accounting Standards In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This Interpretation requires that a recorded tax benefit must be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by tax authorities based upon its technical merits. The amount of benefit recorded is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Upon adoption, any adjustment will be recorded directly to beginning retained earnings. The Interpretation is effective for Abbott beginning no later than January 1, 2007. Abbott has not yet adopted the provisions of this Interpretation. The adoption of this Interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on Abbotts January 1, 2007 balance sheet or the 2007 provision for income taxes. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. The new statement establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Adoption of the provisions of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of Abbott. Legislative Issues In August 2006, the President of the United States signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Among other things, the Act establishes new minimum funding requirements for plan years beginning in 2008. Abbott does not expect this Act to significantly impact future fundings of its domestic defined benefit pension plans. Abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. Abbott believes that if legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing access to health care products and services, or reducing prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors on Form 10 K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbotts operations are discussed in 1A, Risk Factors, to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 41 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management Investment in Boston Scientific Common Stock and Note Receivable At December 31, 2006, Abbott holds 64.6 million shares, or approximately $1.0 billion of Boston Scientific common stock and has a $900 million loan to a wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific. Abbotts cost basis in the shares is approximately $1.3 billion. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in Boston Scientifics share price would decrease the value of the Boston Scientific shares by approximately $205 million. Abbott is required to dispose of the shares by October 2008. Sales of Boston Scientifics shares are limited to approximately 5.4 million shares per month until October 2007. Abbott is also a creditor of Boston Scientific for the $900 million loan that is due in 2011 and, as such, is subject to credit risk. In addition, Abbott holds a derivative financial instrument liability relating to certain gain sharing aspects of the investment in Boston Scientific common stock and an interest derivative financial instrument asset relating to the loan. Other Market Price Sensitive Investments Abbott holds available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions. The market value of these investments, excluding Boston Scientific, was approximately $97 million and $99 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2006 by approximately $20 million. (A 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in share prices.) Non Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $33 million and $17 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. No individual investment is in excess of $13 million. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $1.5 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt due in 2009 through 2014. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. At December 31, 2006, Abbott had $5.0 billion of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average annual interest rate of 5.3% with an average remaining life of 38 days. The fair market value of long term debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 amounted to $7.1 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively) with maturities through 2023. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair market value of current and long term investment securities amounted to $941 million and $80 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or market values. (A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in rates.) Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third party trade payables and 42 receivables. The contracts are marked to market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Abbott held $5.6 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next twelve months. In addition, certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve months. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Abbott held $768 million and $222 million, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the following calendar year. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) (dollars in millions) Receive primarily U.S. Dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 2,644 1.301 $ (38.4 ) $ 1,519 1.184 $ (1.4 ) British Pound 1,910 1.928 (14.4 ) 1,148 1.738 7.2 Japanese Yen 898 115.5 (3.0 ) 513 113.4 (18.4 ) Canadian Dollar 332 1.115 6.4 425 1.176 (2.1 ) All other currencies 603 N/A (2.6 ) 487 N/A Total $ 6,387 $ (52.0 ) $ 4,092 $ (14.7 ) 43
