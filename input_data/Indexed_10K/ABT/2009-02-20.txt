ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Financial Review Abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbotts products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbotts primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals, nutritional products, diagnostic testing products and vascular products. Sales in international markets are approximately 50 percent of consolidated net sales. The worldwide launch of additional indications for HUMIRA, the conclusion of the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture, the acquisitions of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, followed by the launch of the Xience V drug eluting stent, the amendment ending the U.S. Synagis co promotion agreement, the loss of patent protection for some pharmaceutical products, and realized gains and unrealized losses on the Boston Scientific common stock have impacted Abbotts sales, costs and financial position over the last three years. Pharmaceutical research and development is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pain management and infectious diseases. In 2003, Abbott began the worldwide launch of HUMIRA for rheumatoid arthritis, followed by launches for five additional indications, which increased HUMIRAs worldwide sales to $4.5 billion in 2008 compared to $3.0 billion in 2007, and $2.0 billion in 2006. Abbott forecasts worldwide HUMIRA sales to increase more than 25 percent in 2009. Abbott is studying two additional indications for HUMIRA. Substantial research and development and selling support has been and continues to be dedicated to maximizing the worldwide potential of HUMIRA. In December 2006, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. which complemented Abbotts existing franchise in the dyslipidemia market and strengthened the pharmaceutical pipeline for cholesterol management. Abbotts Trilipix, a next generation product for management of triglycerides and the first product approved for use in combination with a statin was launched in 2008. Increased generic competition has resulted in U.S. sales of Omnicef declining from $637 million in 2006 to $25 million in 2008, and worldwide sales of clarithromycin declining from $816 million in 2006 to $651 million in 2008. Abbott has seen generic competition begin in the second half of 2008 for Depakote, which had U.S. sales of $1.3 billion in 2008. On December 31, 2006, the U.S. co promotion agreement for Synagis terminated. Revenues for co promotion of Synagis were $373 million in 2006. In 2007, Abbotts nutritional products businesses were reorganized into a worldwide business to better leverage the opportunities available for strong nutritional brands. Significant efforts have been focused on capturing those opportunities, particularly in developing markets where growth has been strong. In April 2006, Abbott acquired Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and began to integrate it with Abbotts vascular business. The acquisition significantly improved Abbotts competitive position in this business that is characterized by rapid innovation. In 2008, Abbott received FDA approval to market the Xience V drug eluting stent in the U.S. and in 2006 received European Union approval. Xience V became the market leading drug eluting stent in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2008. In April 2006, Abbott acquired 64.6 million shares of Boston Scientific in connection with Abbotts acquisition of the vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses of Guidant. In 2007, the net loss charged to expense for the investment was $153 million. At December 31, 2007, Abbott held 26.4 million shares of Boston Scientific common stock. In 2008, all of these shares were sold resulting in a small gain. Abbotts short and long term debt totaled $11.4 billion at December 31, 2008, largely incurred 26 to finance recent acquisitions. Operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have partially funded acquisitions over the last three years. At December 31, 2008, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard and Poors Corporation and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbotts access to short term financing has not been affected by the recent credit market conditions. In April 2008, Abbott and Takeda concluded their TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) joint venture, evenly splitting the value and assets of the joint venture in a tax free exchange. Abbott received TAPs Lupron business in exchange for Abbotts 50 percent ownership in TAP. Luprons U.S. results are now included in the Pharmaceutical Products segment beginning in May 2008. In 2009, Abbott will focus on several key initiatives. Abbott announced the agreement to acquire Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. (AMO), a new line of business, in January of 2009. The investment in AMO will be approximately $2.8 billion, including debt, and will be financed with operating cash flow and debt. AMOs sales are more than $1 billion per year. In the pharmaceutical business, Abbott will continue maximizing the market potential for HUMIRA and continue to leverage the product and pipeline opportunities of its lipid franchise. Pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to focus on the therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new HUMIRA indications, Trilipix/Crestor fixed dose combination, ABT 874 (a biologic for psoriasis and Crohns disease) and pain relief medication, as well as several Phase I and Phase II clinical programs in neuroscience, oncology and Hepatitis C. In the vascular business, Abbott will continue the launch of the Xience V drug eluting stent in the U.S. after the FDAs approval in 2008, and will focus on development of its next generation drug eluting stent and its bioabsorbable stent. For diabetes care, Abbott will build upon the 2008 launch of the FreeStyle Freedom Lite monitor in the U.S. In the other business segments, Abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets. Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates Approximately 47 percent of Abbotts consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances are in the Pharmaceutical Products segment and the Nutritional Products segment. Abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies, state agencies that administer the federal Medicaid program, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to 24 months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006 amounted to approximately $3.8 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, or 22.8 percent, 21.5 percent and 23.2 percent, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $16.8 billion, $15.0 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $168 million in 2008. Abbott considers a one percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $362 million, $325 million and $247 million for cash discounts in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and $439 million, $269 million and $209 million for returns in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably 27 estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbotts historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel. Management has access to several large customers inventory management data, and for other customers, utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf. These sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel. Except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data. In addition, internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual. In the WIC business, the state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable price, is reliably determinable. Estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott has the WIC business. External data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers the WIC program, participant data from some of the states, and internally administered market research. The USDA has been making its data available for many years. Internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data. At December 31, 2008, Abbott had the exclusive WIC business in 24 states. In the domestic pharmaceutical business, the most significant charges against gross sales are for Medicaid and Medicare Rebates, Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates and Wholesaler Chargebacks. In order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances, management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time. External data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by Abbott. Management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data. To estimate the price rebate percentage, systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price. Abbotts systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant, and Abbott believes they are reliable. The following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals, which comprise approximately 70 percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2008. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (dollars in millions) Domestic Pharmaceutical Products Domestic Nutritionals WIC Rebates Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at January 1, 2006 $ 95 $ 455 $ 134 $ 48 Provisions 637 528 281 533 Payments (596 ) (534 ) (246 ) (514 ) Business combination 36 51 20 Balance at December 31, 2006 136 485 220 87 Provisions 754 438 412 786 Payments (691 ) (503 ) (395 ) (781 ) Balance at December 31, 2007 199 420 237 92 Provisions 808 556 397 1,034 Payments (845 ) (681 ) (406 ) (980 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 162 $ 295 $ 228 $ 146 28 Historically, adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income. In 2007, adjustments were made to prior years rebate accruals. The Medicaid and Medicare rebate accrual was reduced by approximately $69 million and the WIC rebate accrual was increased by approximately $19 million. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For Medicaid, Medicare and other government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. Income Taxes Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items are often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. On January 1, 2007, Abbott adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," which changed the measurement of tax contingencies. Under this Interpretation, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of this Interpretation requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbotts federal income tax returns through 2005 are settled, and the income tax returns for years after 2005 are open. Abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries. Pension and Post Employment Benefits Abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for decades, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Negative asset returns due to recent poor market conditions and low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2008, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for Abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of $2.6 billion and $381 million, respectively. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits. Differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period. Footnote 5 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point. On December 31, 2006, Abbott adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158 "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans." The provisions of this statement require the recognition of the deferrals on the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Adoption of this statement on December 31, 2006 resulted in a decrease in Abbotts shareholders equity of approximately $1.3 billion. Valuation of Intangible Assets Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) "Business Combinations" on January 1, 2009 will result in acquired in process research and development assets 29 acquired in a business combination to be initially recorded as indefinite lived intangible assets. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs. At December 31, 2008, goodwill and intangibles amounted to $10.0 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $787 million in 2008. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2008, 2007 or 2006. Litigation Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with SFAS No. 5 "Accounting for Contingencies." Under SFAS No. 5, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Except for the cases discussed in footnote 8 for which Abbott is unable to estimate a loss, if any, Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $255 million to $495 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Reserves of approximately $325 million have been recorded at December 31, 2008 for these proceedings and exposures. These reserves represent managements best estimate of probable loss, as defined by SFAS No. 5. Stock Compensation Abbott records the fair value of stock options in its results of operations. Since there is no market for trading employee stock options, management must use a fair value method. There is no certainty that the results of a fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash. Fair value methods require management to make several assumptions, the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model, stock price volatility and the average life of an option. Abbott has readily available grant by grant historical activity for several years in its option administration system that it uses in developing some of its assumptions. Abbott uses the Black Scholes method to value stock options. Abbott uses both historical volatility of its stock price and the implied volatility of traded options to develop the volatility assumptions. Abbott uses the historical grant activity, combined with expectations about future exercise activity, to develop the average life assumptions. Abbott has also used the historical grant data to evaluate whether certain holders of stock options exercised their options differently than other holders and has not found any differentiating pattern among holders. 30  Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last three years: Components of Change % Total % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2008 vs. 2007 13.9 1.4 9.3 3.2 2007 vs. 2006 15.3 1.2 10.9 3.2 2006 vs. 2005 0.6 0.6 0.2 (0.2 ) Total U.S. 2008 vs. 2007 10.1 3.4 6.7 2007 vs. 2006 12.0 4.0 8.0 2006 vs. 2005 (7.5 ) 2.4 (9.9 ) Total International 2008 vs. 2007 17.8 (0.5 ) 12.0 6.3 2007 vs. 2006 18.8 (1.7 ) 14.0 6.5 2006 vs. 2005 10.9 (1.3 ) 12.7 (0.5 ) Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2008 vs. 2007 14.2 1.9 9.1 3.2 2007 vs. 2006 18.0 2.4 12.3 3.3 2006 vs. 2005 (9.5 ) 1.8 (11.0 ) (0.3 ) Nutritional Products Segment 2008 vs. 2007 12.2 3.4 6.9 1.9 2007 vs. 2006 1.7 1.4 (1.4 ) 1.7 2006 vs. 2005 9.6 (0.4 ) 9.7 0.3 Diagnostic Products Segment 2008 vs. 2007 13.2 1.3 6.8 5.1 2007 vs. 2006 11.1 (0.6 ) 7.0 4.7 2006 vs. 2005 5.7 (1.1 ) 7.4 (0.6 ) Vascular Products Segment 2008 vs. 2007 34.7 (4.6 ) 35.8 3.5 2007 vs. 2006 53.8 (4.7 ) 55.4 3.1 2006 vs. 2005 327.7 (4.6 ) 333.2 (0.9 ) Worldwide 2008 sales growth compared to 2007 reflects unit growth and the positive effect of the relatively weaker U.S. dollar. Worldwide 2007 sales compared to 2006 reflect the acquisitions of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses on April 21, 2006 and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006. In addition, the Pharmaceutical Products segment had an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) to co promote and distribute three of its products in the U.S. In 2005, Abbott and BI amended the agreement and effective January 1, 2006, Abbott no longer distributed or recorded sales for distribution activities for the BI products although Abbott recorded a small amount of co promotion revenue in 2006. The increases in sales for 2006 excluding BI products were 31 11.6 percent for total net sales, 12.3 percent for total U.S. sales and 7.8 percent for Pharmaceutical Products segment sales. Sales growth in 2007 for the Nutritional Products segment reflects the completion of the U.S. co promotion of Synagis in 2006. Excluding sales of Synagis in 2006, Nutritional Products segment sales increased 11.3 percent. A comparison of significant product group sales is as follows. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. 2008 Percent Change 2007 Percent Change 2006 Percent Change (dollars in millions) Pharmaceuticals U.S. Specialty $ 5,211 20 $ 4,349 24 $ 3,505 25 U.S. Primary Care 3,102 (1 ) 3,139 23 2,561 4 International Pharmaceuticals 7,399 23 6,002 16 5,157 8 Nutritionals U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals 1,268 3 1,233 9 1,128 3 International Pediatric Nutritionals 1,374 26 1,093 22 899 29 U.S. Adult Nutritionals 1,162 8 1,077 2 1,057 1 International Adult Nutritionals 1,070 13 947 15 824 11 Diagnostics Immunochemistry 2,843 13 2,517 11 2,272 4 Increased sales of HUMIRA and the addition of Lupron sales in 2008 accounted for the majority of the sales increase for U.S. Specialty products in 2008. Increased sales of HUMIRA and Depakote accounted for the majority of the sales increases for U.S. Specialty products in 2007 and 2006. U.S. sales of HUMIRA were $2.2 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. U.S. Primary Care sales in 2008 were impacted by a significant decrease in sales of Omnicef due to generic competition, partially offset by increased sales of Niaspan and the TriCor/Trilipix franchise. U.S. Primary Care sales in 2007 were favorably impacted by sales of Niaspan, a new product from the acquisition of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006. In addition, increased sales of TriCor in 2007 and 2006 favorably impacted U.S. Primary Care sales. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Omnicef in 2008 and 2007 and lower U.S. sales of Biaxin in all three years due primarily to the introduction of generic competition. U.S. sales of Omnicef were $25 million, $235 million and $637 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and U.S. sales of Biaxin were $14 million, $36 million and $151 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Increased sales volume of HUMIRA in all three years favorably impacted International Pharmaceuticals sales, partially offset by decreased sales volume in 2008 and 2006 due to generic competition for clarithromycin. International sales of HUMIRA were $2.3 billion, $1.4 billion and $868 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. International Pediatric Nutritionals sales increases were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries. International sales in 2008 and 2007 were also favorably impacted by the effect of the relatively weaker U.S. dollar. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were $111 million, $184 million and $199 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The expiration of licenses, patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. Significant ongoing generic activities and significant patent and license expirations in the next three years are as follows. The U.S. composition of matter patent for Depakote expired in 2008. Abbott has seen generic competition begin in the second half of 2008 for Depakote, which had U.S. sales of $1.3 billion in 2008. 32 Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 57.3 percent of net sales in 2008, 55.9 percent in 2007 and 56.3 percent in 2006. The increase in the gross profit margin in 2008 was due, in part, to favorable product mix and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The decrease in the gross profit margin in 2007 was due, in part, to the unfavorable impact in 2007 of the completion of the U.S. co promotion of Synagis in 2006 as well as generic competition for Omnicef and Biaxin sales in 2007. The increase in the gross profit margin in 2006 was due to favorable product mix, primarily as a result of decreased sales of Boehringer Ingelheim products that had lower margins than other products in the Pharmaceutical Products segment. Restructuring charges, discussed below, reduced the gross profit margins in 2008, 2007 and 2006 by 0.4 percentage points, 0.7 percentage points and 1.1 percentage points, respectively. Gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements, higher commodity costs, higher project expenses for new products, higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth and the effects of inflation. In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. There are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products. These rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the Nutritional and Pharmaceutical Products segments. Higher commodity costs unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins for the Nutritional Products segment in 2008 and 2007 and pricing pressures unfavorably impacted the gross profit margin in 2006. Research and development expense, excluding acquired in process and collaborations research and development, was $2.7 billion in 2008, $2.5 billion in 2007 and $2.3 billion in 2006 and represented increases of 7.3 percent in 2008, 11.1 percent in 2007 and 23.8 percent in 2006. The effect of recording compensation expense relating to share based awards in 2006 and additional costs associated with Abbotts decision to discontinue the commercial development of the ZoMaxx drug eluting stent increased research and development expenses by 6.3 percentage points over 2005. The increases in 2007 and 2006 were also affected by the acquisitions of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses in April 2006 and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006. These increases also reflect increased spending to support pipeline programs, including new indications for HUMIRA, and Trilipix, Trilipix/Crestor fixed dose combination, ABT 874 (a biologic for psoriasis and Crohns disease), pain relief medication and Xience V, as well as several Phase I and Phase II clinical programs in neuroscience, oncology and Hepatitis C. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13.9 percent in 2008 compared to increases of 16.7 percent in 2007 and 15.5 percent in 2006. The 2008 increase reflects the settlement of litigation relating to TriCor, which increased selling, general and administration expenses by 3.1 percentage points. The 2007 increase reflects the acquisitions of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. The 2006 increase reflects recording compensation expense relating to share based awards, a philanthropic contribution to the Abbott Fund and the acquisition of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses. These items increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 8.6 percentage points over 2005. The remaining increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products, including continued spending for HUMIRA and the continuing launch of Xience V, as well as spending on other marketed pharmaceutical products. Increases in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the Pharmaceutical Products segment. Conclusion of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. Joint Venture and Sale of Abbotts Spine Business On April 30, 2008, Abbott and Takeda concluded their TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) joint venture, evenly splitting the value and assets of the joint venture. Abbott exchanged its 50 percent equity 33 interest in TAP for the assets, liabilities and employees related to TAPs Lupron business. Subsequent to the conclusion of the joint venture, TAP was merged into two Takeda entities. The exchange of Abbotts investment in TAP for TAPs Lupron business resulted in a gain at closing of approximately $94 million. The Internal Revenue Service has issued a private letter ruling that the transaction qualifies as tax free for U.S. income tax purposes. Beginning on May 1, 2008, Abbott began recording U.S. Lupron net sales and costs in its operating results and no longer records income from the TAP joint venture. TAPs sales of Lupron were $182 million for the four months ended April 30, 2008 and $645 million and $662 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Abbott also receives payments based on specified development, approval and commercial events being achieved with respect to products retained by Takeda and payments from Takeda based on sales of products retained by Takeda, which are recorded by Abbott as Other (income) expense, net as earned. Such payments, which are subject to tax, are expected to approximate $1.4 billion over the five year period beginning on May 1, 2008. The exchange transaction was accounted for as a sale of Abbotts equity interest in TAP and as an acquisition of TAPs Lupron business under SFAS No. 141 "Business Combinations." The sale of Abbotts equity interest in TAP resulted in the recording of net assets related to the Lupron business, primarily cash, receivables, inventory and other assets, net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, offset by a credit to Abbotts investment in TAP in the amount of approximately $280 million. For the acquired Lupron business, Abbott recorded intangible assets, primarily Lupron product rights, of approximately $700 million, goodwill of approximately $350 million and deferred tax liabilities related primarily to the intangible assets of approximately $260 million. The intangible assets are being amortized over 15 years. Abbott has also agreed to remit cash to Takeda if certain research and development events are not achieved on the development assets retained by Takeda. These amounts were recorded as a liability at closing in the amount of approximately $1.1 billion. Related deferred tax assets of approximately $410 million were also recorded, resulting in an after tax liability of approximately $700 million. Of the $1.1 billion, Abbott made a tax deductible payment of $200 million in 2008 and Abbott will make a tax deductible payment of approximately $120 million in 2009. If the remaining payments are not required, the liability would be reduced and a gain would be recorded. The 50 percent owned joint venture was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Summarized financial information for TAP follows below. The results for 2008 include results through April 30. (dollars in millions) Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 853 $ 3,002 $ 3,363 Cost of sales 229 720 836 Income before taxes 356 1,564 1,524 Net income 238 996 952 In the fourth quarter of 2008, Abbott sold its spine business for approximately $360 million in cash, resulting in an after tax gain of approximately $147 million which is presented as Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes, in the accompanying statement of income. The operations and financial position of the spine business are not presented as discontinued operations because the effects would not be significant. Restructurings In 2008, Abbott management approved a plan to streamline global manufacturing operations, reduce overall costs, and improve efficiencies in Abbotts core diagnostic business. This plan will result in pretax charges of approximately $370 million over the next several years. These charges include employee related 34 costs of approximately $110 million, accelerated depreciation of approximately $75 million, and other related exit costs of approximately $185 million, mainly related to product transfers. In 2008, Abbott recorded a charge to Cost of products sold of approximately $129 million under the plan. Additional charges of approximately $16 million were recorded in 2008 relating to this restructuring, primarily for accelerated depreciation. The remainder of the charges will occur through 2011 as a result of product re registration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries and product transition timelines. The following summarizes the activity for this restructuring: (dollars in millions) 2008 2008 restructuring charge $ 129 Payments and other adjustments (19 ) Accrued balance at December 31 $ 110 In 2008, 2007 and 2006, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, Abbott recorded charges of approximately $36 million, $107 million and $210 million, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $94 million and $181 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, is classified as cost of products sold, $3 million and $29 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, as research and development and $36 million and $10 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, as selling, general and administrative. Fair value for the determination of the amount of asset impairments was determined primarily based on a discounted cash flow method. An additional $81 million, $90 million and $70 million were subsequently recorded in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. In addition, Abbott implemented facilities restructuring plans in 2007 related to the acquired operations of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc., which resulted in an increase to goodwill of approximately $52 million. Abbott expects to incur up to an additional $21 million in future periods for these restructuring plans, primarily for accelerated depreciation. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: (dollars in millions) Employee Related and Other Asset Impairments Total Accrued balance at January 1, 2006 $ 155 $ $ 155 2006 restructuring charges 117 93 210 Payments, impairments and other adjustments (79 ) (93 ) (172 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2006 193 193 2007 restructuring charges 121 38 159 Payments, impairments and other adjustments (120 ) (38 ) (158 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2007 194 194 2008 restructuring charges 36 36 Payments and other adjustments (125 ) (125 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2008 $ 105 $ $ 105 35  Interest expense and Interest (income) In 2008, interest expense decreased primarily as a result of lower interest rates and interest income increased primarily as the result of higher investment balances. Interest expense increased in 2007 and 2006 due primarily to higher borrowings as a result of the acquisitions of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Abbotts investment in the Boston Scientific common stock and note receivable. Other (income) expense, net As described above, Abbott recorded a gain of approximately $94 million in connection with the dissolution of the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture in 2008, which is included in Other (income) expense, net. Other (income) expense, net for 2008 also includes a gain of approximately $52 million on the sale of an equity investment accounted for as an available for sale investment. The remainder of Other (income) expense, net for 2008 relates primarily to contractual payments based on specified development, approval and commercial events being achieved with respect to products retained by Takeda and payments from Takeda based on sales of products retained by Takeda. Other (income) expense, net for 2007 includes a $190 million fair market value loss adjustment to Abbotts investment in Boston Scientific common stock and a realized gain of $37 million on the sales of Boston Scientific common stock. Other (income) expense, net for 2007 and 2006 includes fair value gain adjustments of $28 million and $91 million, respectively, to certain derivative financial instruments included with the investment in Boston Scientific common stock. Taxes on Earnings The income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 19.2 percent in 2008, 19.3 percent in 2007 and 24.6 percent in 2006. Taxes on earnings from continuing operations in 2006 reflect the effect of the tax rates applied to acquired in process research and development and the resolution of prior years income tax audits and the effect of other discrete tax items. For 2006, the tax rates applied to acquired in process and collaborations research and development increased the effective tax rate by 6.6 percentage points and the effect of the income tax audit resolution and other discrete tax items decreased the effective tax rate by 5.5 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of between 17.5 percent and 18.0 percent in 2009. Business Combinations, Technology Acquisitions and Related Transactions In December 2006, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. for cash of approximately $3.8 billion, net of cash held by Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc., to expand Abbotts presence in the lipid management market and to provide several on market and late stage pipeline products. Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. was a specialty pharmaceutical company that developed and marketed proprietary medications for the treatment of chronic cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory diseases. This business was acquired on December 13, 2006 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. The acquisition was financed primarily with short term debt. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in a charge of $1.3 billion for acquired in process research and development, intangible assets of $821 million, goodwill (primarily non deductible) of $1.6 billion and net liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition of $331 million. Acquired intangible assets are being amortized over 4 to 15 years. Non deductible acquired in process research and development was charged to income in 2006. In order to expand Abbotts presence in the growing vascular market, Abbott acquired Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses on April 21, 2006 for approximately $4.1 billion, in cash, in connection with Boston Scientifics acquisition of Guidant. In addition, Abbott agreed to pay to Boston Scientific $250 million each upon government approvals to market the Xience V 36 drug eluting stent in the U.S. and in Japan. In 2008, the FDA approved the marketing of Xience V and Abbott paid Boston Scientific $250 million, resulting in the recording of additional goodwill. Government approval in Japan is anticipated in late 2009 or early 2010 which will also result in the recording of additional goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in a charge of $665 million for acquired in process research and development, intangible assets of $1.2 billion, goodwill (primarily deductible) of $1.7 billion and tangible net assets of $580 million. Acquired intangible assets are being amortized over 4 to 15 years. Deductible acquired in process research and development was charged to income in 2006. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of property and equipment of approximately $530 million, trade accounts receivable of approximately $250 million and inventories of approximately $120 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, litigation reserves and other liabilities. Had the above acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated net sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. In order to facilitate Boston Scientifics acquisition of Guidant, Abbott also acquired 64.6 million shares of Boston Scientific common stock directly from Boston Scientific and loaned $900 million to a wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific. The common stock was valued at $1.3 billion and the note receivable was valued at $829 million at the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition of the shares, Boston Scientific was entitled to certain after tax gains upon Abbotts sale of the shares. In addition, Boston Scientific agreed to reimburse Abbott for certain borrowing costs on debt incurred to acquire the Boston Scientific shares. Abbott recorded a net derivative financial instruments liability of $59 million for the gain sharing derivative financial instrument liability and the interest derivative financial instrument asset. The effect of recording the shares, the loan to Boston Scientific and the derivative financial instruments at fair value on the date of acquisition resulted in the recording of additional goodwill of approximately $204 million. Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments, net were recorded in Other (income) expense, net. Subsequent Event Business Combination In January 2009, Abbott announced an agreement to acquire Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. (AMO), a marketer of ophthalmic surgical technology and devices, as well as eye care solutions, for approximately $2.8 billion, in cash and debt, to take advantage of increasing demand for vision care technologies due to population growth and demographic shifts. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2009. AMOs sales are more than $1 billion per year. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to $7.0 billion, $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash from operating activities of continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007 is higher due to higher operating earnings, decreased prepaid expenses and other assets, and increased trade accounts payable and other liabilities. Cash from operating activities of continuing operations in 2007 and 2006 compared to 2005 is higher due to higher net earnings adjusted for after tax non cash charges for acquired in process research and development in 2006 and share based compensation and higher contributions to retirement benefit plans in 2005 compared to 2007 and 2006; partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2006, including tax payments related to the 2005 remittances of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. Abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, $200 million was funded to the main domestic pension. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of $700 million in 2009 and $200 million annually, thereafter. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends. 37 Debt and Capital At December 31, 2008, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard & Poors Corporation and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit of $5.3 billion that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements of which a $2.3 billion facility expires in December 2009 and a $3.0 billion facility expires in 2012. Abbotts access to short term financing has not been affected by the recent credit market conditions. In 2006, the board of directors authorized the purchase of $2.5 billion of Abbotts common shares from time to time and no shares were purchased under this authorization in 2006. In 2008 and 2007, Abbott purchased approximately 19.0 million of its common shares in each period at a cost of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively under this authorization. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2008, no more purchases of common shares will be made from the 2006 authorization. In October 2008, the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of Abbotts common shares from time to time and 146,400 shares were purchased under this authorization in 2008 at a cost of approximately $8 million. Under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2006, Abbott issued $3.5 billion of long term debt in 2007 that matures in 2012 through 2037 with interest rates ranging from 5.15 percent to 6.15 percent. Proceeds from this debt were used to pay down short term borrowings that were incurred to partially fund the acquisition of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. Under the same registration statement, Abbott issued $4.0 billion of long term debt in 2006 that matures in 2009 through 2016 with interest rates ranging from 5.375 percent to 5.875 percent. Proceeds from this debt were used to pay down domestic commercial paper borrowings that were incurred to partially fund the acquisition of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses. In 2009, the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc., the funding of Abbotts main domestic pension plan and the payment of long term debt will be financed with operating cash flow and debt. Working Capital Working capital was $5.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately $669 million as a result of increased short term borrowings used to acquire Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. in December 2006. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.3 billion in 2008, $1.7 billion in 2007 and $1.3 billion in 2006 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments placed with customers. 38 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008: (dollars in millions) Payment Due By Period Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and Thereafter Long term debt, including current maturities and future interest payments $ 13,512 $ 1,467 $ 2,989 $ 1,896 $ 7,160 Operating lease obligations 416 74 122 88 132 Capitalized auto lease obligations 93 31 62 Purchase commitments (a) 4,627 4,328 258 32 9 Other long term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet Benefit plan obligations 3,048 714 777 1,557 Other 1,524 1,065 198 261 Total $ 23,220 $ 5,900 $ 5,210 $ 2,991 $ 9,119 (a)Purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. Contingent Obligations Abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, with other companies which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. In addition, Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. In connection with the acquisition of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, Abbott will pay to Boston Scientific $250 million upon government approval to market the Xience V drug eluting stent in Japan. Government approval is anticipated in late 2009 or early 2010. In addition, Abbott has retained liabilities for taxes on income prior to the spin off of Hospira and certain potential liabilities, if any, related to alleged improper pricing practices in connection with federal, state and private reimbursement for certain drugs. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007) "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 160 "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51." Abbott will adopt these standards on January 1, 2009. Statement No. 141 (revised 2007) will impact Abbott primarily in five areas: acquired in process research and development will be accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until approval or discontinuation rather than as expense; acquisition costs will be expensed rather than added to the cost of an acquisition; restructuring costs in connection with an acquisition will be expensed rather than added to the cost of an acquisition; the fair value of contingent consideration at the date of an acquisition will be included in the cost of an acquisition; and the fair value of contingent liabilities that are more likely than not of occurrence will be recorded at the date of an acquisition. The effect of these changes will be applicable to acquisitions on or after January 1, 2009. Adoption of Statement No. 160 will not have a material effect on Abbott. 39 Legislative Issues Abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. Abbott believes that if legislation is enacted, it could change access to health care products and services, or reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbotts operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 40  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Financial Instruments and Risk Management Investment in Boston Scientific Common Stock and Note Receivable At December 31, 2007, Abbott held 26.4 million shares, or approximately $300 million of Boston Scientific common stock. In 2008 all of these shares were sold resulting in a small gain. Abbott also has a $900 million loan, due in April 2011, to a wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and, as such, is subject to credit risk. Other Market Price Sensitive Investments Abbott holds available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions, excluding Boston Scientific. The market value of these investments was approximately $105 million and $193 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2008 by approximately $21 million. (A 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in share prices.) Non Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $42 million and $37 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. No individual investment is in excess of $13 million. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt due in 2009 through 2017. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. At December 31, 2008, Abbott had $1.0 billion of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average annual interest rate of 0.2% with an average remaining life of 11 days. The fair value of long term debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007 amounted to $10.5 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 5.2% and 5.0%, respectively) with maturities through 2037. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair value of current and long term investment securities amounted to $1.8 billion and $896 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or market values. (A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in rates.) Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked to market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Abbott held $8.3 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next twelve months. In addition, certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany 41 purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve months. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Abbott held $129 million and $281 million, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the following calendar year. Abbott has designated approximately $585 million of foreign denominated short term debt as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of this debt due to changes in exchange rates are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007: (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) Receive primarily U.S. Dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 3,963 1.286 $ 3 $ 2,630 1.464 $ (11 ) British Pound 1,208 1.553 (31 ) 1,030 2.041 Japanese Yen 1,788 99.6 54 939 113.9 (5 ) Canadian Dollar 163 1.240 3 426 0.995 (1 ) All other currencies 1,254 N/A 19 716 N/A (4 ) Total $ 8,376 $ 48 $ 5,741 $ (21 ) 42
