ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Financial Review Abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbotts products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbotts primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals, nutritional products, diagnostic testing products and vascular products. Sales in international markets are approximately 50 percent of consolidated net sales. The worldwide launch of additional indications for HUMIRA, the conclusion of the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture, the acquisitions of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc., Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, followed by the launch of the Xience V drug eluting stent, the loss of patent protection for some pharmaceutical products, the amendment ending the U.S. Synagis co promotion agreement, and realized gains and unrealized losses on the Boston Scientific common stock have impacted Abbotts sales, costs and financial position over the last three years. Pharmaceutical research and development is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pain management and infectious diseases. In 2003, Abbott began the worldwide launch of HUMIRA for rheumatoid arthritis, followed by launches for five additional indications, which increased HUMIRAs worldwide sales to $5.5 billion in 2009 compared to $4.5 billion in 2008, and $3.0 billion in 2007. Abbott forecasts worldwide HUMIRA sales to increase by approximately 20 percent in 2010. Abbott is studying additional indications for HUMIRA. Substantial research and development and selling support has been and continues to be dedicated to maximizing the worldwide potential of HUMIRA. In December 2006, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. which complemented Abbotts existing franchise in the dyslipidemia market and strengthened the pharmaceutical pipeline for cholesterol management. Abbotts Trilipix, a next generation product for management of triglycerides and the first product approved for use in combination with a statin was launched in 2008. Increased generic competition has resulted in worldwide Depakote sales declining from $1.6 billion in 2007 to $426 million in 2009, U.S. sales of Omnicef declining from $235 million in 2007 to $3 million in 2009 and worldwide sales of clarithromycin declining from $724 million in 2007 to $599 million in 2009. In 2007, Abbotts nutritional products businesses were reorganized into a worldwide business to better leverage the opportunities available for strong nutritional brands. Significant efforts have been focused on capturing those opportunities, particularly in developing markets where growth has been strong. In 2008, Abbott received FDA approval to market the Xience V drug eluting stent in the U.S. and in 2006 received European Union approval. Xience V became the market leading drug eluting stent in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2008. In June 2009, Xience PRIME, Abbotts next generation drug eluting stent, received CE Mark approval and was launched in Europe in August 2009. Abbott received approval to market Xience V in Japan in January 2010. In April 2006, Abbott acquired 64.6 million shares of Boston Scientific in connection with Abbotts acquisition of the vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses of Guidant. In 2007, the net loss charged to expense for the investment was $153 million. At December 31, 2007, Abbott held 26.4 million shares of Boston Scientific common stock. In 2008, all of these shares were sold resulting in a small gain. Abbotts short and long term debt totaled $16.5 billion at December 31, 2009, largely incurred to finance recent acquisitions. Operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have partially funded acquisitions over the last three years. At December 31, 2009, Abbotts long term debt 26 rating was AA by Standard and Poors Corporation and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbotts access to short term financing was not affected by the credit market conditions in 2008 and early 2009. In April 2008, Abbott and Takeda concluded their TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) joint venture, evenly splitting the value and assets of the joint venture in a tax free exchange. Abbott received TAPs Lupron business in exchange for Abbotts 50 percent ownership in TAP. Luprons U.S. results are included in the Pharmaceutical Products segment beginning in May 2008. Abbott also receives payments based on specified development, approval and commercial events being achieved with respect to products retained by Takeda and payments from Takeda based on sales of products retained by Takeda. In 2010, Abbott will focus on several key initiatives. In the pharmaceutical business, Abbott will continue to build its global presence, expand its presence in emerging markets and diversify its sources of growth with its previously announced acquisition of Solvays pharmaceuticals business, which closed on February 15, 2010. Abbott will also continue maximizing the market potential for HUMIRA and continue to leverage the product and pipeline opportunities of its lipid franchise, including Certriad, which is expected to receive approval in the first half of 2010. Pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to focus on the therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to compounds in early and mid stage development for oncology, immunology, Hepatitis C, neuroscience, and pain management. Such compounds include two oncology compounds in advanced clinical trials, ABT 874 (a biologic for psoriasis), three HCV compounds in human studies, and two compounds in Phase II clinical trials for Alzheimers disease. In the vascular business, Abbott launched the Xience V drug eluting stent in Japan after receiving approval in January 2010, and will also focus on marketing Xience PRIME in Europe and other markets as well as development of Xience PRIME in the U.S. and its bioabsorbable stent. In the other business segments, Abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets. Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates Approximately 50 percent of Abbotts consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances are in the Pharmaceutical Products segment and the Nutritional Products segment. Abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies, state agencies that administer the federal Medicaid program, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to 24 months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007 amounted to approximately $4.4 billion, $3.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, or 23.8 percent, 22.8 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $18.4 billion, $16.8 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $184 million in 2009. Abbott considers a one percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $414 million, $362 million and $325 million for cash discounts in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $456 million, $439 million and $269 million for returns in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably 27 estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbotts historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel. Management has access to several large customers inventory management data, and for other customers, utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf. These sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel. Except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data. In addition, internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual. In the WIC business, the state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable price, is reliably determinable. Estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott has the WIC business. External data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers the WIC program, participant data from some of the states, and internally administered market research. The USDA has been making its data available for many years. Internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data. At December 31, 2009, Abbott had the exclusive WIC business in 24 states. In the domestic pharmaceutical business, the most significant charges against gross sales are for Medicaid and Medicare Rebates, Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates and Wholesaler Chargebacks. In order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances, management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time. External data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by Abbott. Management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data. To estimate the price rebate percentage, systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price. Abbotts systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant, and Abbott believes they are reliable. The following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals, which comprise approximately 67 percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2009. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (dollars in millions) Domestic Pharmaceutical Products Domestic Nutritionals WIC Rebates Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at January 1, 2007 $ 136 $ 485 $ 220 $ 87 Provisions 754 438 412 786 Payments (691 ) (503 ) (395 ) (781 ) Balance at December 31, 2007 199 420 237 92 Provisions 808 556 397 1,034 Payments (845 ) (681 ) (406 ) (980 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 162 295 228 146 Provisions 747 563 505 1,134 Payments (756 ) (506 ) (494 ) (1,120 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 153 $ 352 $ 239 $ 160 Historically, adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income. In 2007, adjustments were made to prior years rebate accruals. The Medicaid and Medicare rebate accrual was 28 reduced by approximately $69 million and the WIC rebate accrual was increased by approximately $19 million. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For Medicaid, Medicare and other government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. Income Taxes Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items are often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. In accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbotts federal income tax returns through 2005 are settled, and the income tax returns for years after 2005 are open. Abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries. Pension and Post Employment Benefits Abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for decades, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Negative asset returns in 2008 due to poor market conditions and low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2009, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for Abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of $2.7 billion and $501 million, respectively. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits. Differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period. Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point. Valuation of Intangible Assets Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which relate to in process research and development acquired in a business 29 combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2009, goodwill and intangibles amounted to $13.2 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $879 million in 2009. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2009, 2008 or 2007. Litigation Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 450, "Contingencies." Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Except for the cases discussed in Note 8 for which Abbott is unable to estimate a loss, if any, Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $170 million to $310 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Reserves of approximately $215 million have been recorded at December 31, 2009 for these proceedings and exposures. These reserves represent managements best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, "Contingencies." Stock Compensation Abbott records the fair value of stock options in its results of operations. Since there is no market for trading employee stock options, management must use a fair value method. There is no certainty that the results of a fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash. Fair value methods require management to make several assumptions, the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model, stock price volatility and the average life of an option. Abbott has readily available grant by grant historical activity for several years in its option administration system that it uses in developing some of its assumptions. Abbott uses the Black Scholes method to value stock options. Abbott uses both historical volatility of its stock price and the implied volatility of traded options to develop the volatility assumptions. Abbott uses the historical grant activity, combined with expectations about future exercise activity, to develop the average life assumptions. Abbott has also used the historical grant data to evaluate whether certain holders of stock options exercised their options differently than other holders and has not found any differentiating pattern among holders. 30  Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last three years: Components of Change % Total % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2009 vs. 2008 4.2 (0.1 ) 8.3 (4.0 ) 2008 vs. 2007 13.9 1.4 9.3 3.2 2007 vs. 2006 15.3 1.2 10.9 3.2 Total U.S. 2009 vs. 2008 0.4 (0.3 ) 0.7 2008 vs. 2007 10.1 3.4 6.7 2007 vs. 2006 12.0 4.0 8.0 Total International 2009 vs. 2008 7.7 0.2 15.1 (7.6 ) 2008 vs. 2007 17.8 (0.5 ) 12.0 6.3 2007 vs. 2006 18.8 (1.7 ) 14.0 6.5 Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2009 vs. 2008 (1.3 ) (0.1 ) 3.0 (4.2 ) 2008 vs. 2007 14.2 1.9 9.1 3.2 2007 vs. 2006 18.0 2.4 12.3 3.3 Nutritional Products Segment 2009 vs. 2008 7.3 1.5 8.6 (2.8 ) 2008 vs. 2007 12.2 3.4 6.9 1.9 2007 vs. 2006 1.7 1.4 (1.4 ) 1.7 Diagnostic Products Segment 2009 vs. 2008 0.1 1.4 3.7 (5.0 ) 2008 vs. 2007 13.2 1.3 6.8 5.1 2007 vs. 2006 11.1 (0.6 ) 7.0 4.7 Vascular Products Segment 2009 vs. 2008 20.1 (2.9 ) 26.0 (3.0 ) 2008 vs. 2007 34.7 (4.6 ) 35.8 3.5 2007 vs. 2006 53.8 (4.7 ) 55.4 3.1 Worldwide sales growth in 2009 reflects unit growth and the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. on February 25, 2009, partially offset by the negative effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar. Worldwide, U.S. and Pharmaceutical Products segment sales also reflect decreased sales of Depakote due to generic competition. Excluding U.S. Depakote sales in 2009 and 2008, worldwide sales increased 7.7 percent, U.S. sales increased 7.6 percent and Pharmaceutical Products segment sales increased 4.3 percent. Worldwide 2008 sales growth reflects unit growth and the positive effect of the relatively weaker U.S. dollar. Worldwide 2007 sales growth reflects the acquisitions of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses on April 21, 2006 and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006. Sales growth in 2007 for the Nutritional Products segment reflects the completion 31 of the U.S. co promotion of Synagis in 2006. Excluding sales of Synagis in 2006, Nutritional Products segment sales increased 11.3 percent in 2007. A comparison of significant product group sales is as follows. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. 2009 Percent Change 2008 Percent Change 2007 Percent Change (dollars in millions) Pharmaceuticals U.S. Specialty $ 4,676 (10 ) $ 5,211 20 $ 4,349 24 U.S. Primary Care 3,043 (2 ) 3,102 (1 ) 3,139 23 International Pharmaceuticals 7,861 6 7,399 23 6,002 16 Nutritionals U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals 1,306 3 1,268 3 1,233 9 International Pediatric Nutritionals 1,543 12 1,374 26 1,093 22 U.S. Adult Nutritionals 1,269 9 1,162 8 1,077 2 International Adult Nutritionals 1,106 3 1,070 13 947 15 Diagnostics Immunochemistry 2,798 (2 ) 2,843 13 2,517 11 Decreased sales of Depakote due to generic competition impacted U.S. Specialty product sales in 2009 and 2008. This was partially offset by increased sales of HUMIRA and by the addition of Lupron sales from the conclusion of the TAP joint venture in April 2008. Increased sales of HUMIRA and Depakote impacted U.S. Specialty product sales in 2007. U.S. sales of HUMIRA were $2.5 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and U.S. sales of Depakote were $331 million, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. U.S. Primary Care sales in all three years were impacted by decreased sales of Omnicef, Synthroid and Biaxin due to generic competition. This was partially offset in 2009 and 2008 by increased sales of Niaspan and in 2008 by higher TriCor/Trilipix franchise sales. U.S. Primary Care sales in 2007 were favorably impacted by sales of TriCor and Niaspan, a new product from the acquisition of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006. Increased sales volume of HUMIRA in all three years favorably impacted International Pharmaceuticals sales, partially offset by decreased sales of clarithromycin in 2009 and 2008 due to generic competition. International sales of HUMIRA were $3.0 billion, $2.3 billion and $1.4 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased International Pharmaceutical sales in 2009 by 8.6 percent and the relatively weaker U.S. dollar increased International Pharmaceutical sales in 2008 and 2007 by 7.3 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively. International Pediatric Nutritionals sales increases were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries. International Adult Nutritionals sales and Immunochemistry sales in 2009 were negatively impacted by the effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were $120 million, $111 million and $184 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The expiration of licenses, patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. There are currently no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 57.1 percent of net sales in 2009, 57.3 percent in 2008 and 55.9 percent in 2007. The decrease in the gross profit margin in 2009 was due, in part, to the negative impact from lower sales of Depakote and the unfavorable effect of exchange on the gross profit margin ratio; partially offset by 32 improved margins in the vascular and diagnostics businesses. The increase in the gross profit margin in 2008 was due, in part, to favorable product mix and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The decrease in the gross profit margin in 2007 was due, in part, to the unfavorable impact in 2007 of the completion of the U.S. co promotion of Synagis in 2006 as well as generic competition for Omnicef and Biaxin sales in 2007. In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. There are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products. These rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the Nutritional and Pharmaceutical Products segments. Research and development expense was $2.744 billion in 2009, $2.689 billion in 2008 and $2.506 billion in 2007 and represented increases of 2.0 percent in 2009, 7.3 percent in 2008 and 11.1 percent in 2007. The increase in 2009 reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which reduced research and development expense in 2009. Excluding the effect of exchange, research and development expenses increased 3.4 percent in 2009. The increase in 2007 was affected by the acquisitions of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses in April 2006 and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006. These increases, excluding the effects of exchange, also reflect continued pipeline spending, including programs in vascular devices, immunology, neuroscience, oncology, Hepatitis C and pain management. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.4 percent in 2009 compared to increases of 13.9 percent in 2008 and 16.7 percent in 2007. The 2009 decrease reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which was offset by expenses relating to the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. and the settlement of litigation. Excluding the effects of the charges and exchange, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.9 percent in 2009. The 2008 increase reflects the settlement of litigation relating to TriCor, which increased selling, general and administration expenses by 3.1 percentage points. The 2007 increase reflects the acquisitions of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. The remaining increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products, including continued spending for HUMIRA and Xience V, and inflation. Conclusion of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. Joint Venture and Sale of Abbotts Spine Business On April 30, 2008, Abbott and Takeda concluded their TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) joint venture, evenly splitting the value and assets of the joint venture. Abbott exchanged its 50 percent equity interest in TAP for the assets, liabilities and employees related to TAPs Lupron business. Subsequent to the conclusion of the joint venture, TAP was merged into two Takeda entities. The exchange of Abbotts investment in TAP for TAPs Lupron business resulted in a gain at closing of approximately $94 million. The Internal Revenue Service has issued a private letter ruling that the transaction qualifies as tax free for U.S. income tax purposes. Beginning on May 1, 2008, Abbott began recording U.S. Lupron net sales and costs in its operating results and no longer records income from the TAP joint venture. TAPs sales of Lupron were $182 million for the four months ended April 30, 2008 and $645 million in 2007. Abbott also receives payments based on specified development, approval and commercial events being achieved with respect to products retained by Takeda and payments from Takeda based on sales of products retained by Takeda, which are recorded by Abbott as Other (income) expense, net as earned. The exchange transaction was accounted for as a sale of Abbotts equity interest in TAP and as an acquisition of TAPs Lupron business. The sale of Abbotts equity interest in TAP resulted in the recording of net assets related to the Lupron business, primarily cash, receivables, inventory and other assets, net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, offset by a credit to Abbotts investment in TAP in the amount of approximately $280 million. 33 For the acquired Lupron business, Abbott recorded intangible assets, primarily Lupron product rights, of approximately $700 million, goodwill of approximately $350 million and deferred tax liabilities related primarily to the intangible assets of approximately $260 million. The intangible assets are being amortized over 15 years. Abbott has also agreed to remit cash to Takeda if certain research and development events are not achieved on the development assets retained by Takeda. These amounts were recorded as a liability at closing in the amount of approximately $1.1 billion. Related deferred tax assets of approximately $410 million were also recorded. Of the $1.1 billion, Abbott made tax deductible payments of $83 million and $200 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and Abbott will make a tax deductible payment of approximately $36 million in 2010. In 2009, events occurred resulting in the remaining payments not being required and the remaining liability in the amount of $797 million was derecognized and recorded as income in Other (income) expense, net. The 50 percent owned joint venture was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Summarized financial information for TAP follows below. The results for 2008 include results through April 30. (dollars in millions) Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Net sales $ 853 $ 3,002 Cost of sales 229 720 Income before taxes 356 1,564 Net income 238 996 In the fourth quarter of 2008, Abbott sold its spine business for approximately $360 million in cash, resulting in an after tax gain of approximately $147 million which is presented as Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes, in the accompanying statement of income. The operations and financial position of the spine business are not presented as discontinued operations because the effects would not be significant. Restructurings In 2008, Abbott management approved a plan to streamline global manufacturing operations, reduce overall costs, and improve efficiencies in Abbotts core diagnostic business. In 2008, Abbott recorded a charge to Cost of products sold of approximately $129 million under the plan. Additional charges of approximately $54 million and $16 million were recorded in 2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to this restructuring, primarily for accelerated depreciation and product transfer costs. Additional charges will be incurred through 2011 as a result of product re registration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries and product transition timelines. The following summarizes the activity for this restructuring: (dollars in millions) 2008 restructuring charge $ 129 Payments and other adjustments (19 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2008 110 Payments and other adjustments (12 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2009 $ 98 In 2009 and prior years, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, Abbott recorded charges of approximately $114 million, $36 million and $107 million, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $94 million in 2007 is classified as cost of products sold, $3 million in 2007 as research and development 34 and $114 million, $36 million and $10 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as selling, general and administrative. Fair value for the determination of the amount of asset impairments was determined primarily based on a discounted cash flow method. An additional $47 million, $81 million and $90 million were subsequently recorded in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. In addition, Abbott implemented facilities restructuring plans in 2007 related to the acquired operations of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. which resulted in an increase to goodwill of approximately $52 million. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: (dollars in millions) Accrued balance at January 1, 2007 $ 193 2007 restructuring charges 159 Payments, impairments and other adjustments (158 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2007 194 2008 restructuring charges 36 Payments, impairments and other adjustments (125 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2008 105 2009 restructuring charges 114 Payments and other adjustments (74 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2009 $ 145 Interest expense and Interest (income) In 2009 and 2008, interest expense decreased primarily as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by increased debt levels in 2009 related to the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. Interest expense increased in 2007 due primarily to higher borrowings as a result of the acquisitions of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Abbotts investment in the Boston Scientific common stock and note receivable. Interest income decreased in 2009 due to lower interest rates and increased in 2008 and 2007 due to higher investment balances. Other (income) expense, net Other (income) expense, net, for 2009 includes the derecognition of a contingent liability of $797 million associated with the conclusion of the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture as discussed above, a $287 million gain from the settlement reached between Abbott and Medtronic, Inc. resolving all outstanding intellectual property litigation between the two parties and income from the recording of certain investments at fair value in connection with business acquisitions. Other (income) expense, net, for 2009 and 2008 also includes ongoing contractual payments from Takeda associated with the conclusion of the TAP joint venture and a gain in 2008 on the sale of an equity investment accounted for as an available for sale investment. In addition, Abbott recorded a gain of approximately $94 million in connection with the dissolution of the TAP joint venture in 2008. Other (income) expense, net for 2007 includes a $190 million fair market value loss adjustment to Abbotts investment in Boston Scientific common stock and a realized gain of $37 million on the sales of Boston Scientific common stock. Taxes on Earnings The income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 20.1 percent in 2009, 19.2 percent in 2008 and 19.3 percent in 2007. The tax rate in 2009 was effected by a higher tax rate applied to the derecognition of a contingent liability associated with the conclusion of the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture and the Medtronic intellectual property litigation settlement. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of between 16 percent and 16.5 percent in 2010. 35 Business Combinations, Technology Acquisitions and Related Transactions On January 1, 2009, Abbott adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations," as codified in FASB ASC No. 805, "Business Combinations." Under ASC No. 805, acquired in process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until approval or discontinuation rather than as expense, acquisition costs in connection with an acquisition are expensed rather than added to the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of contingent consideration at the date of an acquisition is added to the cost of the acquisition. In February 2009, Abbott acquired the outstanding shares of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. (AMO) for approximately $1.4 billion in cash, net of cash held by AMO. Prior to the acquisition, Abbott held a small investment in AMO. Abbott acquired AMO to take advantage of increasing demand for vision care technologies due to population growth and demographic shifts and AMOs premier position in its field. Abbott acquired control of this business on February 25, 2009 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. The acquisition was financed with long term debt. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition is shown in the table below: (dollars in billions) Goodwill, non deductible $ 1.7 Acquired intangible assets, non deductible 0.9 Acquired in process research and development, non deductible 0.2 Acquired net tangible assets 0.4 Acquired debt (1.5 ) Deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition (0.3 ) Total allocation of fair value $ 1.4 Acquired intangible assets consist of established customer relationships, developed technology and trade names and will be amortized over 2 to 30 years (average of 15 years). Acquired in process research and development will be accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of trade accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment and other assets, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, accrued compensation and other liabilities. Abbott incurred approximately $89 million of acquisition related expenses in 2009 which are classified as Selling, general and administrative expense. In addition, subsequent to the acquisition, Abbott repaid substantially all of the acquired debt of AMO. In October 2009, Abbott acquired 100 percent of Visiogen, Inc. for $400 million, in cash, providing Abbott with a next generation accommodating intraocular lens (IOL) technology to address presbyopia for cataract patients. The preliminary allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non deductible acquired in process research and development of approximately $195 million which will be accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, non deductible definite lived intangible assets of approximately $33 million, goodwill of approximately $260 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $89 million. Acquired intangible assets consist of developed technology and will be amortized over 12 years. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation is completed. In October 2009, Abbott acquired Evalve, Inc. for $320 million, in cash, plus an additional payment of $90 million to be made upon completion of certain regulatory milestones. Abbott acquired Evalve to obtain a presence in the growing area of percutaneous treatment for structural heart disease. Including a previous investment in Evalve, Abbott has acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Evalve. In connection with the acquisition, the carrying amount of this investment was revalued to fair value resulting in recording $28 million of income, which is reported as Other (income) expense, net. The preliminary allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non deductible definite lived intangible assets of approximately $145 million, non deductible acquired in process research and development of 36 approximately $228 million which will be accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, goodwill of approximately $158 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $136 million. Acquired intangible assets consist of developed technology and will be amortized over 12 years. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation is completed. In January 2009, Abbott acquired Ibis Biosciences, Inc. (Ibis) for $175 million, in cash, to expand Abbotts position in molecular diagnostics for infectious disease. Including a $40 million investment in Ibis in 2008, Abbott has acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Ibis. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition has been allocated to goodwill and amortizable intangible assets, and acquired in process research and development that will be accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The investment in Ibis in 2008 resulted in a charge to acquired in process research and development. In connection with the acquisition, the carrying amount of this investment was revalued to fair value resulting in recording $33 million of income, which is reported as Other (income) expense, net. Had the above acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated net sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. In December 2009, Abbott acquired the global rights to a novel biologic for the treatment of chronic pain for $170 million, in cash, resulting in a charge to acquired in process research and development. In September 2009, Abbott announced an agreement to acquire Solvays pharmaceuticals business for EUR 4.5 billion (approximately $6.2 billion), in cash, plus additional payments of up to EUR 300 million if certain sales milestones are met. This acquisition will provide Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and a significant presence in key global emerging markets and will add approximately $500 million to Abbotts research and development spending. The transaction closed on February 15, 2010. Sales for the acquired business are forecast to be approximately $2.9 billion in 2010. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation is completed. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to $7.3 billion, $7.0 billion and $5.2 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash from operating activities of continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007 is higher due to higher operating earnings, decreased prepaid expenses and other assets, and increased trade accounts payable and other liabilities. Abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. Abbott funded $700 million in 2009, and $200 million annually in 2008 and 2007 to the main domestic pension plan. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of $200 million annually. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2009, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard & Poors Corporation and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit of $6.3 billion that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements of which a $3.3 billion facility expires in October 2010 and a $3.0 billion facility expires in 2012. Related compensating balances, which are subject to withdrawal by Abbott at its option, and commitment fees are not material. Abbotts access to short term financing was not affected by the credit market conditions in 2008 and early 2009. In October 2008, the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of Abbotts common shares from time to time. Under this authorization, 14.5 million shares were purchased in 2009 at a cost of approximately $800 million and 146,400 shares were purchased in 2008 at a cost of approximately 37 $8 million. In 2008 and 2007, Abbott purchased approximately 19.0 million of its common shares in each period at a cost of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, under a prior authorization. Under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2009, Abbott issued $3.0 billion of long term debt in the first quarter of 2009 that matures in 2019 and 2039 with interest rates of 5.125 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. Proceeds from this debt were used to fund the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. and to repay debt of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. In addition, Abbott repaid $1 billion of long term notes that were due in 2009 using short term borrowings. Under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2006, Abbott issued $3.5 billion of long term debt in 2007 that matures in 2012 through 2037 with interest rates ranging from 5.15 percent to 6.15 percent. Proceeds from this debt were used to pay down short term borrowings that were incurred to partially fund the acquisition of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. The acquisition of Solvays pharmaceuticals business on February 15, 2010 was funded with current cash and short term investments. The judgment entered by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Abbott in its litigation with New York University and Centocor, Inc. requires Abbott to secure the judgment in the event that its appeal to the Federal Circuit court is unsuccessful in overturning the district courts decision. Abbott expects to deposit approximately $1.8 billion with an escrow agent during the first quarter of 2010 and will consider these assets to be restricted. Working Capital Working capital was $10.3 billion at December 31, 2009, $5.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in working capital in 2009 was due, primarily, to increased levels of cash and investments and the derecognition of a contingent liability associated with the conclusion of the TAP joint venture; partially offset by increased debt levels. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.1 billion in 2009, $1.3 billion in 2008 and $1.7 billion in 2007 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments placed with customers. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: (dollars in millions) Payment Due By Period Total 2010 20112012 20132014 2015 and Thereafter Long term debt, including current maturities and future interest payments $ 18,008 $ 816 $ 4,162 $ 1,743 $ 11,287 Operating lease obligations 484 99 152 101 132 Capitalized auto lease obligations 84 28 56 Purchase commitments (a) 3,307 3,118 159 23 7 Other long term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet Benefit plan obligations 2,981 479 420 2,082 Other 2,165 1,417 229 519 Total $ 27,029 $ 4,061 $ 6,425 $ 2,516 $ 14,027 (a)Purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. 38 Contingent Obligations Abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, with other companies which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. In addition, Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. In connection with the acquisition of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, Abbott paid $250 million to Boston Scientific in January 2010 upon government approval to market the Xience V drug eluting stent in Japan. In addition, Abbott has retained liabilities for taxes on income prior to the spin off of Hospira and certain potential liabilities, if any, related to alleged improper pricing practices in connection with federal, state and private reimbursement for certain drugs. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)," as codified in FASB ASC No. 810, "Consolidation." FASB ASC No. 810 provides consolidation guidance relating to variable interest entities. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. Adoption of these provisions is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of Abbott. Legislative Issues Abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. Abbott believes that if legislation is enacted, it could change access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbotts operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 39   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Financial Instruments and Risk Management Investment in Boston Scientific Note Receivable At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Abbott has a $900 million loan to a wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific which is payable to Abbott in April 2011 and, as such, is subject to credit risk. Other Market Price Sensitive Investments Abbott holds available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions. The market value of these investments was approximately $75 million and $105 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2009 by approximately $15 million. (A 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in share prices.) Non Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $78 million and $42 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No individual investment is in excess of $18 million. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $5.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt due in 2011 through 2019. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. At December 31, 2009, Abbott had $2.9 billion of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average annual interest rate of 0.1% with an average remaining life of 22 days. The fair value of long term debt at December 31, 2009 and 2008 amounted to $12.3 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 5.3% and 5.2%, respectively) with maturities through 2039. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of current and long term investment securities amounted to $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or market values. (A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in rates.) Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked to market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Abbott held $7.5 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next twelve months. In addition, certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency 40 exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve months. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Abbott held $2.0 billion and $129 million, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the following calendar year. Abbott has designated foreign denominated short term debt of approximately $575 million and approximately $585 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of this debt due to changes in exchange rates are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008: (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) Contract Amount Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) Receive primarily U.S. Dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 4,045 1.482 $ (20 ) $ 3,963 1.286 $ 3 British Pound 1,246 1.658 (2 ) 1,208 1.553 (31 ) Japanese Yen 2,057 89.8 (46 ) 1,788 99.6 54 Canadian Dollar 448 1.064 (4 ) 163 1.240 3 All other currencies 1,714 N/A (11 ) 1,254 N/A 19 Total $ 9,510 $ (83 ) $ 8,376 $ 48 41  (This page has been left blank intentionally.) 42
