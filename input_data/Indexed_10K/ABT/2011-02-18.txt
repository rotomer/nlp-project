ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Financial Review Abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbotts products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbotts primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals, nutritional products, diagnostic testing products and vascular products. Sales in international markets are approximately 55 percent of consolidated net sales. Continued robust growth of HUMIRA after the worldwide launch of additional indications, the acquisitions of Solvays pharmaceuticals business (Solvay Pharmaceuticals), Piramal Healthcare Limiteds Healthcare Solutions business, and Advanced Medical Optics, Inc., the launch of the Xience V drug eluting stent, the conclusion of the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture, the loss of patent protection for some pharmaceutical products, and the challenging economic environment in many countries around the world have impacted Abbotts sales, costs and financial position over the last three years. Pharmaceutical research and development is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pain management, hepatitis C (HCV), chronic kidney disease and womens health. In 2003, Abbott began the worldwide launch of HUMIRA for rheumatoid arthritis, followed by launches for five additional indications, which increased HUMIRAs worldwide sales to $6.5 billion in 2010 compared to $5.5 billion in 2009, and $4.5 billion in 2008. Abbott forecasts growth in the low teens for worldwide HUMIRA sales in 2011. Abbott is studying additional indications for HUMIRA. Substantial research and development and selling support has been and continues to be dedicated to maximizing the worldwide potential of HUMIRA. Increased generic competition has resulted in U.S. Depakote sales declining from $1.3 billion in 2008 to $161 million in 2010. Austerity measures implemented by several European countries reduced healthcare spending and affected pharmaceutical pricing in the second half of 2010 and that impact is expected to continue for all of 2011. In February 2010, Abbott acquired Solvay Pharmaceuticals which provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expanded Abbotts presence in key global emerging markets. The acquisition added approximately $3.1 billion to Abbotts 2010 total sales, primarily outside the U.S. In 2010, Abbott recorded approximately $710 million of expense related to the integration of the Solvay business and a restructuring plan announced in September to streamline operations, improve efficiencies and reduce costs primarily in certain Solvay sites and functions. The restructuring plan is further described below. In September 2010 Abbott completed the acquisition of Piramals Healthcare Solutions business, propelling Abbott to market leadership in the Indian pharmaceutical market and further accelerating the companys growth in emerging markets. In 2007, Abbotts nutritional products businesses were reorganized into a worldwide business to better leverage the opportunities available for strong nutritional brands. Significant efforts have been focused on capturing those opportunities, particularly in developing markets where growth has been strong. In 2008, Abbott received FDA approval to market the Xience V drug eluting stent in the U.S. and in 2006 received European Union approval. Xience V became the market leading drug eluting stent in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2008. In June 2009, Xience PRIME, Abbotts next generation drug eluting stent, received CE Mark approval and was launched in Europe in August 2009. Abbott received approval to market Xience V in Japan in January 2010 and Xience V became the market leading drug eluting stent in Japan in the second quarter of 2010. In 2010, the U.S. government passed health care reform legislation which included an increase in Medicaid rebate rates and the extension of the rebate to drugs provided through Medicaid managed care 28 Table of Contents organizations beginning in 2010. The legislation also imposes annual fees to be paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical device companies beginning in 2011 and 2013, respectively, as well as additional rebates related to the Medicare Part D "donut hole" beginning in 2011. In addition to a one time charge of approximately $60 million to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy, the legislation negatively impacted Abbotts performance by more than $200 million in 2010 and that is expected to increase to more than $400 million in 2011. Abbotts short and long term debt totaled $18.9 billion at December 31, 2010, largely incurred to finance acquisitions. Operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have partially funded acquisitions over the last three years. At December 31, 2010, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard and Poors Corporation and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. In April 2008, Abbott and Takeda concluded their TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) joint venture, evenly splitting the value and assets of the joint venture in a tax free exchange. Abbott received TAPs Lupron business in exchange for Abbotts 50 percent ownership in TAP. Luprons U.S. results are included in the Pharmaceutical Products segment beginning in May 2008. Abbott also receives payments based on specified development, approval and commercial events being achieved with respect to products retained by Takeda and payments from Takeda based on sales of products retained by Takeda. In 2011, Abbott will focus on several key initiatives. In the pharmaceutical business, Abbott will continue to build its global presence, expand its presence in emerging markets and diversify its sources of growth with the Solvay Pharmaceuticals and Piramal Healthcare Solutions acquisitions. Abbott will also continue maximizing the market potential for HUMIRA. Pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to focus a significant portion of expenditures on compounds for immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pain management, HCV, chronic kidney disease and womens health. Such compounds include one Phase III compound for multiple sclerosis, one Phase III compound and three Phase II compounds in oncology, three Phase II compounds targeting HCV, three Phase II compounds targeting Alzheimers disease or cognitive disorders of schizophrenia, two Phase II compounds targeting chronic kidney disease, and one Phase II compound each in womens health and pain management. In the vascular business, Abbott will continue to focus on marketing Xience PRIME in Europe and other markets, obtaining regulatory review of Xience Nano, Xience PRIME, and the MitraClip device in the U.S. and a limited European roll out as well as further clinical development of ABSORB, its bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) device. In the other business segments, Abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets. Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates Approximately 50 percent of Abbotts consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances are in the Pharmaceutical Products segment and the Nutritional Products segment. Abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies, state agencies that administer the federal Medicaid program, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to 24 months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks 29 Table of Contents charged against gross sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounted to approximately $4.9 billion, $4.4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, or 23.1 percent, 23.8 percent and 22.8 percent, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $21.1 billion, $18.4 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $211 million in 2010. Abbott considers a one percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $415 million, $414 million and $362 million for cash discounts in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $537 million, $456 million and $439 million for returns in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbotts historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel. Management has access to several large customers inventory management data, and for other customers, utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf. These sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel. Except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data. In addition, internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual. In the WIC business, the state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable price, is reliably determinable. Estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott has the WIC business. External data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers the WIC program, participant data from some of the states, and internally administered market research. The USDA has been making its data available for many years. Internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data. At December 31, 2010, Abbott had the exclusive WIC business in 23 states. In the domestic pharmaceutical business, the most significant charges against gross sales are for Medicaid and Medicare Rebates, Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates and Wholesaler Chargebacks. In order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances, management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time. External data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by Abbott. Management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data. To estimate the price rebate percentage, systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price. Abbotts systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant, and Abbott believes they are reliable. The following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals, which comprise approximately 69 percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2010. Remaining rebate 30 Table of Contents provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (dollars in millions) Domestic Pharmaceutical Products Domestic Nutritionals WIC Rebates Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at January 1, 2008 $ 199 $ 420 $ 237 $ 92 Provisions 808 556 397 1,034 Payments (845 ) (681 ) (406 ) (980 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 162 295 228 146 Provisions 747 563 505 1,134 Payments (756 ) (506 ) (494 ) (1,120 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 153 352 239 160 Provisions 616 899 841 1,162 Payments (640 ) (617 ) (670 ) (1,163 ) Balance at December 31, 2010 $ 129 $ 634 $ 410 $ 159 Historically, adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For Medicaid, Medicare and other government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. Income Taxes Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items are often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. In accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbotts federal income tax returns through 2005 are settled, and the income tax returns for years after 2005 are open. Abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries. Pension and Post Employment Benefits Abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for decades, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Negative asset returns in 2008 due to poor market conditions and low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2010, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for Abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of $2.9 billion and $307 million, respectively. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits. Differences between the expected long term return on plan 31 Table of Contents assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period. Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point. Valuation of Intangible Assets Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which relate to in process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2010, goodwill and intangibles amounted to $15.9 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $1.4 billion in 2010. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2010, 2009 or 2008. Litigation Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 450, "Contingencies." Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $75 million to $115 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Reserves of approximately $95 million have been recorded at December 31, 2010 for these proceedings and exposures. These reserves represent managements best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, "Contingencies." Stock Compensation Abbott records the fair value of stock options in its results of operations. Since there is no market for trading employee stock options, management must use a fair value method. There is no certainty that the results of a fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash. Fair value methods require management to make several assumptions, the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model, stock price volatility and the average life of an option. Abbott has readily available grant by grant historical activity for several years in its option administration system that it uses in developing some of its assumptions. Abbott uses the Black Scholes model to value stock options. Abbott uses both historical volatility of its stock price and the implied volatility of traded options to develop the volatility assumptions. Abbott uses the historical grant activity, combined with expectations about future exercise activity, to develop the average life assumptions. Abbott has also used the historical grant data to evaluate whether certain holders of stock options exercised their options differently than other holders and has not found any differentiating pattern among holders. 32  Table of Contents Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last three years: Components of Change % Total % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2010 vs. 2009 14.3 (0.1 ) 13.2 1.2 2009 vs. 2008 4.2 (0.1 ) 8.3 (4.0 ) 2008 vs. 2007 13.9 1.4 9.3 3.2 Total U.S. 2010 vs. 2009 6.8 0.7 6.1 2009 vs. 2008 0.4 (0.3 ) 0.7 2008 vs. 2007 10.1 3.4 6.7 Total International 2010 vs. 2009 20.7 (0.8 ) 19.3 2.2 2009 vs. 2008 7.7 0.2 15.1 (7.6 ) 2008 vs. 2007 17.8 (0.5 ) 12.0 6.3 Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2010 vs. 2009 20.7 0.2 19.5 1.0 2009 vs. 2008 (1.3 ) (0.1 ) 3.0 (4.2 ) 2008 vs. 2007 14.2 1.9 9.1 3.2 Nutritional Products Segment 2010 vs. 2009 4.7 1.7 1.2 1.8 2009 vs. 2008 7.3 1.5 8.6 (2.8 ) 2008 vs. 2007 12.2 3.4 6.9 1.9 Diagnostic Products Segment 2010 vs. 2009 6.0 0.1 4.3 1.6 2009 vs. 2008 0.1 1.4 3.7 (5.0 ) 2008 vs. 2007 13.2 1.3 6.8 5.1 Vascular Products Segment 2010 vs. 2009 18.6 (4.7 ) 22.3 1.0 2009 vs. 2008 20.1 (2.9 ) 26.0 (3.0 ) 2008 vs. 2007 34.7 (4.6 ) 35.8 3.5 Worldwide sales growth in 2010 reflects the acquisition of Solvays pharmaceuticals business on February 15, 2010, unit growth and the positive effect of the relatively weaker U.S. dollar. Worldwide sales growth in 2009 reflects unit growth and the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. on February 25, 2009, partially offset by the negative effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar. Worldwide, U.S. and Pharmaceutical Products segment sales also reflect decreased sales of Depakote due to generic competition in 2009. Excluding U.S. Depakote sales, worldwide sales increased 7.7 percent, U.S. sales increased 7.6 percent and Pharmaceutical Products segment sales increased 4.3 percent from 2008 to 2009. 33 Table of Contents Worldwide 2008 sales growth reflects unit growth and the positive effect of the relatively weaker U.S. dollar. A comparison of significant product group sales is as follows. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. 2010 Percent Change 2009 Percent Change 2008 Percent Change (dollars in millions) Pharmaceuticals U.S. Specialty $ 4,596 (2 ) $ 4,676 (10 ) $ 5,211 20 U.S. Primary Care 3,010 (1 ) 3,043 (2 ) 3,102 (1 ) International Pharmaceuticals 8,287 5 7,861 6 7,399 23 Nutritionals U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals 1,208 (7 ) 1,306 3 1,268 3 International Pediatric Nutritionals 1,676 9 1,543 12 1,374 26 U.S. Adult Nutritionals 1,345 6 1,269 9 1,162 8 International Adult Nutritionals 1,268 15 1,106 3 1,070 13 Diagnostics Immunochemistry 2,904 4 2,798 (2 ) 2,843 13 Decreased sales of Depakote due to generic competition impacted U.S. Specialty product sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008 and lower sales of Zemplar, Kaletra and Lupron affected U.S. Specialty product sales in 2010. These were partially offset by increased sales of HUMIRA in all three years and the addition of Lupron sales from the conclusion of the TAP joint venture in April 2008 which increased U.S. Specialty product sales in 2009 and 2008. U.S. sales of HUMIRA were $2.8 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and U.S. sales of Depakote were $161 million, $331 million and $1.3 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. U.S. Primary Care sales were impacted by the discontinuation of Azmacort and generic competition for Cardizem LA in 2010, by decreased sales of Synthroid in 2009 and 2008 and by decreased sales of Omnicef and Biaxin in 2008 due to generic competition. These were partially offset in all three years by increased sales of Niaspan and in 2010 and 2008 by higher TriCor/Trilipix franchise sales. Increased sales volume of HUMIRA in 2010, 2009 and 2008 favorably impacted International Pharmaceuticals sales, partially offset by decreased sales of clarithromycin. International sales of HUMIRA were $3.7 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.3 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The relatively weaker dollar increased International Pharmaceutical sales in 2010 and 2008 by 1.9 percent and 7.3 percent, respectively. The relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased International Pharmaceutical sales in 2009 by 8.6 percent. International Pediatric Nutritionals sales increases were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries. U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals sales in 2010 were affected by the voluntary recall of certain Similac brand powder infant formulas in September 2010. International Adult Nutritionals sales and Immunochemistry sales in 2010 and 2008 were positively impacted by the effect of the relatively weaker U.S. dollar and were negatively impacted in 2009 by the effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were approximately $58 million, $120 million and $111 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The expiration of licenses, patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. There are currently no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years. Under a license agreement for TriCor 145 mg, generic competition could begin as early as March 2011 but is not expected until July 2012. Under an agreement relating to Abbotts niacin products 34 Table of Contents and acquired with the Kos Pharmaceuticals acquisition, Niaspan may become subject to generic competition in September 2013. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 58.3 percent of net sales in 2010, 57.1 percent in 2009 and 57.3 percent in 2008. The increase in the gross profit margin in 2010 was due, in part, to improved margins in the pharmaceutical, vascular, diabetes and diagnostics businesses and the favorable effect of exchange on the gross profit margin ratio. The decrease in the gross profit margin in 2009 was due, in part, to the negative impact from lower sales of Depakote and the unfavorable effect of exchange on the gross profit margin ratio; partially offset by improved margins in the vascular and diagnostics businesses. The increase in the gross profit margin in 2008 was due, in part, to favorable product mix and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. There are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products. These rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the Nutritional and Pharmaceutical Products segments. Research and development expense was $3.724 billion in 2010, $2.744 billion in 2009 and $2.689 billion in 2008 and represented increases of 35.7 percent in 2010, 2.0 percent in 2009 and 7.3 percent in 2008. Excluding charges related to the Solvay restructurings announced in September 2010, research and development expenses in 2010 increased 29.4 percent. This increase, exclusive of the effects of the restructuring charges, reflects the acquisitions of Solvays pharmaceuticals business in February 2010 and Facet Biotech in April 2010. The increase in 2009 reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which reduced research and development expense in 2009. Excluding the effect of exchange, research and development expenses increased 3.4 percent in 2009. The increases in 2010, 2009 and 2008 also reflect continued pipeline spending, including programs in vascular devices, biologics, neuroscience, oncology and hepatitis C. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 23.4 percent in 2010, decreased 0.4 percent in 2009 and increased 13.9 percent in 2008. Excluding charges related to the Solvay restructuring and integration charges, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased 18.2 percent. This increase, exclusive of the effects of the restructuring and integration charges, reflects the acquisitions of Solvays pharmaceuticals business in 2010 and Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. in 2009 and higher provisions for litigation in 2010. The 2009 decrease reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which was offset by expenses relating to the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. and the settlement of litigation. Excluding the effects of the charges and exchange, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.9 percent in 2009. The 2008 increase reflects the settlement of litigation relating to TriCor, which increased selling, general and administration expenses by 3.1 percentage points. The remaining increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products, including continued spending for HUMIRA and Xience V, and inflation. Conclusion of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. Joint Venture and Sale of Abbotts Spine Business On April 30, 2008, Abbott and Takeda concluded their TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. (TAP) joint venture, evenly splitting the value and assets of the joint venture. Abbott exchanged its 50 percent equity interest in TAP for the assets, liabilities and employees related to TAPs Lupron business. Subsequent to the conclusion of the joint venture, TAP was merged into two Takeda entities. The exchange of Abbotts investment in TAP for TAPs Lupron business resulted in a gain at closing of approximately $94 million. The Internal Revenue Service has issued a private letter ruling that the transaction qualifies as tax free for U.S. income tax purposes. 35  Table of Contents Beginning on May 1, 2008, Abbott began recording U.S. Lupron net sales and costs in its operating results and no longer records income from the TAP joint venture. TAPs sales of Lupron were $182 million for the four months ended April 30, 2008. Abbott also receives payments based on specified development, approval and commercial events being achieved with respect to products retained by Takeda and payments from Takeda based on sales of products retained by Takeda, which are recorded by Abbott as Other (income) expense, net when the specified event is achieved or as the applicable sales are made. The exchange transaction was accounted for as a sale of Abbotts equity interest in TAP and as an acquisition of TAPs Lupron business. The sale of Abbotts equity interest in TAP resulted in the recording of net assets related to the Lupron business, primarily cash, receivables, inventory and other assets, net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, offset by a credit to Abbotts investment in TAP in the amount of approximately $280 million. For the acquired Lupron business, Abbott recorded intangible assets, primarily Lupron product rights, of approximately $700 million, goodwill of approximately $350 million and deferred tax liabilities related primarily to the intangible assets of approximately $260 million. The intangible assets are being amortized over 15 years. Abbott agreed to remit cash to Takeda if certain research and development events were not achieved on the development assets retained by Takeda. These amounts were recorded as a liability at closing in the amount of approximately $1.1 billion. Related deferred tax assets of approximately $410 million were also recorded. Of the $1.1 billion, Abbott made tax deductible payments of $36 million, $83 million and $200 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008. In 2009 events occurred resulting in the remaining payments not being required and the remaining liability in the amount of $797 million was derecognized and recorded as income in Other (income) expense, net. In 2008, Abbott sold its spine business for approximately $360 million in cash, resulting in an after tax gain of approximately $147 million which is presented as Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes, in the accompanying statement of income. The operations and financial position of the spine business are not presented as discontinued operations because the effects would not be significant. Restructurings In 2010, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan primarily related to the acquisition of Solvays pharmaceuticals business. This plan streamlines operations, improves efficiencies and reduces costs in certain Solvay sites and functions as well as in certain Abbott and Solvay commercial organizations in various countries. Action plans have been identified and most are expected to be implemented within the next two years. This plan will result in pretax charges of approximately $810 million to $970 million over the life of the plan. These charges include employee related costs of approximately $650 million, accelerated depreciation and asset write downs of approximately $105 million, and other related exit costs of up to approximately $215 million, mainly related to discontinuation of certain research and development programs and product transfers. Under this plan, Abbott recorded charges to Cost of products sold, Research and development and Selling, general and administrative of approximately $99 million, $152 million and $272 million, respectively. Additional charges of $12 million were subsequently recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation. The following summarizes the activity for this restructuring: (dollars in millions) 2010 restructuring charge $ 523 Payments, impairments and other adjustments (113 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2010 $ 410 In 2010 and prior years, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, Abbott recorded charges of approximately $56 million, $114 million and $36 million, respectively, reflecting the impairment of 36 Table of Contents manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $56 million in 2010 is classified as Cost of products sold and $114 million and $36 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, are classified as Selling, general and administrative. An additional $13 million, $47 million and $81 million were subsequently recorded in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: (dollars in millions) Accrued balance at January 1, 2008 $ 194 2008 restructuring charges 36 Payments, impairments and other adjustments (125 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2008 105 2009 restructuring charges 114 Payments, impairments and other adjustments (74 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2009 145 2010 restructuring charges 56 Payments and other adjustments (124 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2010 $ 77 In 2008, Abbott management approved a plan to streamline global manufacturing operations, reduce overall costs, and improve efficiencies in Abbotts core diagnostic business. In 2008, Abbott recorded a charge to Cost of products sold of approximately $129 million under the plan. Additional charges of approximately $60 million, $54 million and $16 million were recorded in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to this restructuring, primarily for accelerated depreciation and product transfer costs. Additional charges will be incurred through 2011 as a result of product re registration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries and product transition timelines. The following summarizes the activity for this restructuring: (dollars in millions) 2008 restructuring charge $ 129 Payments and other adjustments (19 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2008 110 Payments and other adjustments (12 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2009 98 Payments and other adjustments (10 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2010 $ 88 Interest expense and Interest (income) In 2010, interest expense increased due primarily to increased debt levels. In 2009 and 2008, interest expense decreased primarily as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by increased debt levels in 2009 related to the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. Interest income decreased in 2010 due to lower investment balances, decreased in 2009 due to lower interest rates and increased in 2008 due to higher interest rates. Other (income) expense, net Other (income) expense, net, for 2009 includes the derecognition of a contingent liability of $797 million associated with the conclusion of the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture as discussed above, a $287 million gain from the settlement reached between Abbott and Medtronic, Inc. resolving all outstanding intellectual property litigation between the two parties and income from the recording of certain investments at fair value in connection with business acquisitions. Other (income) 37 Table of Contents expense, net, for 2010, 2009 and 2008 also includes ongoing contractual payments from Takeda associated with the conclusion of the TAP joint venture and a gain in 2008 on the sale of an equity investment accounted for as an available for sale investment. In addition, Abbott recorded a gain of approximately $94 million in connection with the dissolution of the TAP joint venture in 2008. Taxes on Earnings The income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 19.0 percent in 2010, 20.1 percent in 2009 and 19.2 percent in 2008. As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act which were signed into law in 2010, Abbott recorded a charge of approximately $60 million in 2010 to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy. The tax rate in 2009 was affected by a higher tax rate applied to the derecognition of a contingent liability associated with the conclusion of the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture and the Medtronic intellectual property litigation settlement. In October 2010, Puerto Rico enacted legislation that assesses a tax beginning in 2011 on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. This excise tax will be recorded in Cost of products sold although the tax is expected to be creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. Research and Development Programs Abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical and nutritional products in development. The significant areas of therapeutic focus include the following: Pharmaceutical Products Immunology Projects are ongoing to identify new mechanisms with the potential to treat an array of immune mediated diseases. Projects include early stage work in oral DMARD therapies and a number of biologic candidates. Phase III trials are ongoing for additional indications of HUMIRA including ulcerative colitis in Japan, ankylosing spondylitits in China, pediatric Crohns disease in the U.S. and the European Union (EU), uvetis in the U.S., EU and Japan, and peripheral and axial spondyloarthritis in the U.S. and EU. Global regulatory applications for ulcerative colitis were submitted in early 2011. Neuroscience/Pain Abbott is focused on the development of compounds that target receptors in the brain that help regulate mood, memory and other neurological functions to address conditions such as Alzheimers disease, schizophrenia, pain, Parkinsons disease and multiple sclerosis (MS). This includes three compounds directed toward the treatment of Alzheimers disease. ABT 126 and ABT 288 are completing Phase II studies in early 2011 and ABT 384 will complete its Phase II study later in 2011. Daclizumab, a next generation antibody, entered Phase III clinical trials for relapsing remitting MS in the second quarter of 2010. Oncology Abbott is focused on the development of targeted treatments that inhibit tumor growth and improve response to common cancer therapies. Abbott has new molecular entities in development for more than a dozen types of cancer including: ABT 869, a multi targeted kinase inhibitor, for which a Phase III trial for liver cancer was initiated in 2010 and Phase II studies for other cancer types are ongoing. ABT 263, a Bcl 2 family protein antagonist, currently in Phase II development for chronic lymphoid leukemia. ABT 888, a PARP inhibitor, is completing Phase II in early 2011. 38 Table of Contents Elotuzamab under a collaboration agreement acquired as part of the Facet Biotech acquisition in 2010. Abbott expects to begin Phase III development of elotuzamab for the treatment of multiple myeloma with its partner in 2011. Hepatitis C Abbotts antiviral program is focused on developing treatments for hepatitis C (HCV) and includes a partnership with Enanta Pharmaceuticals to discover protease inhibitors as well as internal programs focused on additional viral targets. In 2010, Abbott initiated Phase II clinical trials to evaluate three of Abbotts HCV antiviral agents, including the investigational protease inhibitor ABT 450, part of the Enanta collaboration. Polymerase inhibitors ABT 333 and ABT 072 as well as ABT 267, a NS5A inhibitor, are currently being developed exclusively by Abbott. Womens Health In 2010, Abbott entered into a collaboration agreement with Neurocrine to develop and commercialize elagolix, an oral gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, for the treatment of endometriosis related pain and fibroids. A Phase II study in endometriosis was recently completed. Chronic Kidney Disease In 2010, Abbott entered into an agreement with Reata Pharmaceuticals for ex U.S. rights, excluding certain Asian markets, to bardoxolone, an investigational treatment for chronic kidney disease (CKD). A Phase IIb study was recently completed and a global Phase III trial is targeted to begin in 2011. In addition, new formulations of Abbotts existing pharmaceutical products, including Lupron 6 month depot and AndroGel 1.62%, are currently under FDA review. Work is also continuing on numerous early stage programs, including the biologic acquired from Pangenetics for chronic pain in late 2009, a cMet antibody for cancer in partnership with Pierre Fabre SA, and other programs across all of Abbotts therapeutic areas of focus. Vascular Ongoing projects in the pipeline include: Xience Nano, a version of Xience V for small vessels, currently under regulatory review in the U.S. Xience PRIME, the next generation drug eluting stent (DES) based on Xience V attributes. Ongoing clinical trials for Xience PRIME in the U.S. are evaluating a range of stent sizes, including small vessel and long lengths. ABSORB, a bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) device for the treatment of coronary artery disease that is gradually resorbed into the vessel wall. In 2010 Abbott released four year data from its ABSORB clinical trial, which showed efficacy and safety results consistent with the three year data. In early 2010, Abbott also initiated the ABSORB EXTEND clinical trial which will enroll up to 1,000 patients with more complex coronary artery disease. In 2011 after receiving CE Mark approval for ABSORB, Abbott announced its plans to initiate a randomized, controlled clinical trial later in 2011 to further study the device in an expanded population in Europe. A global trial, including the U.S. and other geographies, is planned for later this year. MitraClip device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation In September 2010, Abbott announced additional data from the EVEREST II (Endovascular Valve Edge to Edge REpair STudy) trial on the safety and clinical benefits of the MitraClip system. Abbotts MitraClip system which is on the market in Europe is currently under review for approval by the FDA. Coronary and endovascular core product projects, including new coronary and endovascular guide wires, and the Herculink Elite stent for renal indication in the U.S., are at various stages of development and or undergoing regulatory approvals. Medical Optics Abbott is expanding its proprietary laser platforms into new vision correction applications, including cataract surgery, and is developing new diagnostic instruments and treatments to improve visual outcomes. Synchrony, a next generation intraocular lens (IOL) designed to mimic the eyes 39 Table of Contents natural ability to change focus and deliver improved vision at all distances for patients following cataract surgery, is currently under FDA review. Abbott is also developing new products for patients undergoing cataract surgery, including new intraocular lenses that address astigmatism, a new insertion system to facilitate micro incision surgery and an ophthalmic viscoelastic for the U.S. market. Molecular Diagnostics Numerous new molecular diagnostic products, including oncology and infectious disease assays as well as improved instrument systems, are currently under development. An assay to aid in the management of HCV infected patients undergoing antiviral therapy is currently under U.S. regulatory review. Additional assays to detect the presence of HIV virus, tuberculosis, and CMV viral load and a test to detect hepatitis B drug resistance in patients are under regulatory review for CE Mark approval. Core Laboratory Diagnostics Abbott is researching dozens of novel biomarkers focusing on areas such as diabetes, infectious disease, and neuroscience disorders and also has several next generation instrument systems for hematology, immunochemistry and blood screening in development. Diabetes Care Abbott is developing new products for diabetes patients including the next generation Freestyle glucose monitoring system with new features supporting the insulin using patient. This new system is currently under regulatory review for CE Mark approval and a filing for FDA approval is expected to be submitted in 2011. Nutrition Abbott is focusing its R&D spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: immunity, cognition, lean body mass, inflammation, metabolism and tolerance. Numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development and are expected to be launched in 2011. Given the diversity of Abbotts business, its intention to remain a broad based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project (compound or device) over the next year relative to Abbotts total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbotts overall market position. There were no delays in Abbotts 2010 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations. While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical and medical device projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbotts ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. However, Abbott plans to continue to manage our portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately 9.5 percent to 10 percent of sales each year. Business Combinations, Technology Acquisitions and Related Transactions On January 1, 2009, Abbott adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations," as codified in FASB ASC No. 805, "Business Combinations." Under ASC No. 805, acquired in process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until approval or discontinuation rather than as expense. In addition, acquisition costs in connection with an acquisition are expensed rather than added to the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of contingent consideration at the date of an acquisition is added to the cost of the acquisition. On September 8, 2010, Abbott acquired Piramal Healthcare Limiteds Healthcare Solutions business, a leader in the Indian branded generics market, for $2.2 billion, in cash, plus additional payments of $400 million annually in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Abbott recorded a $1.6 billion liability for the present 40 Table of Contents value of the additional payments at the acquisition date. The acquisition was financed with current cash. The preliminary allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in the recording of $2.7 billion of deductible acquired intangible assets and $1.0 billion of deductible goodwill. Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of trade names, customer relationships and associated rights and will be amortized over an average of 19 years. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation is completed. In February 2010, Abbott acquired Solvays pharmaceuticals business (Solvay Pharmaceuticals) for approximately $6.1 billion, in cash, plus additional payments of up to EUR 100 million per year if certain sales milestones are met in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Contingent consideration of approximately $290 million was recorded based on a preliminary valuation. The acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals provides Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expands Abbotts presence in key global emerging markets. Abbott acquired control of this business on February 15, 2010 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. Net sales for the acquired operations for 2010 were approximately $3.1 billion. Pretax loss of the acquired operations, including acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses, for 2010 was approximately $395 million. The acquisition was funded with current cash and short term investments. The preliminary allocation of the fair value of the acquisition is shown in the table below (in billions of dollars). The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation is completed. Goodwill, non deductible $ 2.2 Acquired intangible assets, non deductible 4.1 Acquired in process research and development, non deductible 0.5 Acquired net tangible assets 0.7 Deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition (1.1 ) Total preliminary allocation of fair value $ 6.4 Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of product rights for currently marketed products and are amortized over 2 to 14 years (average of 11 years). Acquired in process research and development is accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of trade accounts receivable of approximately $675 million, inventory of approximately $390 million, property and equipment of approximately $725 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, accrued compensation and other liabilities. The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Abbott as if the acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals had taken place on January 1, 2010 and January 1, 2009. The pro forma information includes adjustments for amortization of intangible assets and fair value adjustments to acquisition date inventory as well as acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses. The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations as they would have been had the transaction been effected on the assumed date. (in billions of dollars, except per share amounts) 2010 2009 Net sales $ 35.8 $ 34.2 Net earnings 4.6 5.2 Diluted earnings per common share 2.96 3.36 In March 2010, Abbott acquired STARLIMS Technologies for approximately $100 million, in cash, net of cash held by STARLIMS, providing Abbott with leading products and expertise to build its position in laboratory informatics. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition has been allocated to goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation is completed. 41  Table of Contents In April 2010, Abbott acquired the outstanding shares of Facet Biotech Corporation for approximately $430 million, in cash, net of cash held by Facet. The acquisition enhances Abbotts early and mid stage pharmaceutical pipeline, including a biologic for multiple sclerosis and compounds that complement Abbotts oncology program. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition has been allocated to acquired in process research and development that is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation. In February 2009, Abbott acquired the outstanding shares of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. (AMO) for approximately $1.4 billion in cash, net of cash held by AMO. Prior to the acquisition, Abbott held a small investment in AMO. Abbott acquired AMO to take advantage of increasing demand for vision care technologies due to population growth and demographic shifts and AMOs premier position in its field. Abbott acquired control of this business on February 25, 2009 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. The acquisition was financed with long term debt. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition is shown in the table below: (dollars in billions) Goodwill, non deductible $ 1.7 Acquired intangible assets, non deductible 0.9 Acquired in process research and development, non deductible 0.2 Acquired net tangible assets 0.4 Acquired debt (1.5 ) Deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition (0.3 ) Total allocation of fair value $ 1.4 Acquired intangible assets consist of established customer relationships, developed technology and trade names and are amortized over 2 to 30 years (average of 15 years). Acquired in process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of trade accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment and other assets, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, accrued compensation and other liabilities. In addition, subsequent to the acquisition, Abbott repaid substantially all of the acquired debt of AMO. In October 2009, Abbott acquired 100 percent of Visiogen, Inc. for $400 million, in cash, providing Abbott with a next generation accommodating intraocular lens (IOL) technology to address presbyopia for cataract patients. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non deductible acquired in process research and development of approximately $200 million which is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, non deductible definite lived intangible assets of approximately $24 million and goodwill of approximately $200 million. In October 2009, Abbott acquired Evalve, Inc. for $320 million, in cash, plus an additional payment of $90 million to be made upon completion of certain regulatory milestones. Abbott acquired Evalve to obtain a presence in the growing area of non surgical treatment for structural heart disease. Including a previous investment in Evalve, Abbott has acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Evalve. In connection with the acquisition, the carrying amount of this investment was revalued to fair value resulting in recording $28 million of income, which is reported as Other (income) expense, net. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non deductible definite lived intangible assets of approximately $140 million, non deductible acquired in process research and development of approximately $220 million which is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, goodwill of approximately $100 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $110 million. Acquired intangible assets consist of developed technology and will be amortized over 11 years. In January 2009, Abbott acquired Ibis Biosciences, Inc. (Ibis) for $175 million, in cash, to expand Abbotts position in molecular diagnostics for infectious disease. Including a $40 million investment in Ibis 42 Table of Contents in 2008, Abbott has acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Ibis. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition has been allocated to goodwill and amortizable intangible assets, and acquired in process research and development which is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The investment in Ibis in 2008 resulted in a charge to acquired in process research and development. In connection with the acquisition, the carrying amount of this investment was revalued to fair value resulting in recording $33 million of income, which is reported as Other (income) expense, net. Except for the acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, had the above acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated net sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. In 2010, Abbott entered into an agreement to acquire licensing rights outside the U.S., excluding certain Asian markets, to a product in development for the treatment of chronic kidney disease resulting in a charge to acquired in process research and development of $238 million. In addition, Abbott acquired an equity interest of approximately $62 million. In 2011, Abbott expects to acquire an additional equity interest and make milestone and other payments related to the license agreement totaling approximately $300 million. In 2010, Abbott also entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize a product for the treatment of endometriosis resulting in a charge to acquired in process research and development of $75 million. Additional payments of approximately $500 million could be required for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. In 2009, Abbott acquired the global rights to a novel biologic for the treatment of chronic pain for $170 million, in cash, resulting in a charge to acquired in process research and development. Goodwill At December 31, 2010, goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled $15.9 billion. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. The results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value except for the Medical Optics unit. While the fair value of the Medical Optics business exceeds its carrying value, extended economic pressure particularly in the LASIK surgery business and longer regulatory approval timelines for products currently under development could result in a valuation in the future where the fair value of the Medical Optics unit has declined below its carrying value, thereby triggering the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill and measure for impairment. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to $8.7 billion, $7.3 billion and $7.0 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. $2.0 billion of long term debt to be paid in March and May of 2011 will be funded out of operating cash flow and borrowings. Abbott funded $525 million in 2010, $862 million in 2009 and $285 million in 2008 to defined pension plans. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of $200 million annually. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2010, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard & Poors Corporation and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit of $6.7 billion that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements of which a $3.0 billion facility 43 Table of Contents expires in October 2012 and a $3.7 billion facility expires in 2013. Related compensating balances, which are subject to withdrawal by Abbott at its option, and commitment fees are not material. In October 2008, the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of Abbotts common shares from time to time. Under this authorization, 14.8 million shares were purchased in 2010 at a cost of approximately $800 million, 14.5 million shares were purchased in 2009 at a cost of approximately $800 million and 146,400 shares were purchased in 2008 at a cost of approximately $8 million. In 2008, Abbott also purchased approximately 19.0 million of its common shares at a cost of approximately $1.1 billion under a prior authorization. Under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2009, Abbott issued $3.0 billion of long term debt in the second quarter of 2010 that matures in 2015, 2020 and 2040 with interest rates of 2.7 percent, 4.125 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively. Proceeds from this debt were used to pay down short term borrowings. Under the February 2009 registration statement, Abbott issued $3.0 billion of long term debt in the first quarter of 2009 that matures in 2019 and 2039 with interest rates of 5.125 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. Proceeds from this debt were used to fund the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. and to repay debt of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. In addition, Abbott repaid $1 billion of long term notes that were due in 2009 using short term borrowings. In connection with the judgment entered by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Abbott in its litigation with New York University and Centocor, Inc., Abbott executed a collaterized escrow agreement in February 2010 with a financial institution to secure the judgment in the event that Abbotts appeal to the federal circuit court is unsuccessful in overturning the district courts decision. Abbott has deposited approximately $1.87 billion with the escrow agent and considers these assets to be restricted. The assets are invested in U.S. Treasury bills and money market funds per the terms of the agreement. Working Capital Working capital was $5.1 billion at December 31, 2010, $10.3 billion at December 31, 2009 and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2008. The decrease in working capital in 2010 was due primarily to cash and investments used to acquire Solvays pharmaceuticals business and Piramal Healthcare Limiteds Healthcare Solutions business. The increase in working capital in 2009 was due primarily to increased levels of cash and investments and the derecognition of a contingent liability associated with the conclusion of the TAP joint venture; partially offset by increased debt levels. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.0 billion in 2010, $1.1 billion in 2009 and $1.3 billion in 2008 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments placed with customers. 44 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010: (dollars in millions) Payment Due By Period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 and Thereafter Long term debt, including current maturities and future interest payments $ 22,549 $ 2,757 $ 2,519 $ 2,358 $ 14,915 Operating lease obligations 637 129 200 128 180 Capitalized auto lease obligations 90 30 60 Purchase commitments (a) 2,737 2,668 68 1 Other long term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet Benefit plan obligations 2,807 480 413 1,914 Other 4,333 3,143 777 413 Total (b) $ 33,153 $ 5,584 $ 6,470 $ 3,677 $ 17,422 (a)Purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. (b)Unrecognized tax benefits totaling $2.5 billion are excluded from the table above as Abbott is unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities on such items. Contingent Obligations Abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, with other companies which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. In addition, Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. Legislative Issues In the first quarter 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to herein as "health care reform legislation") were signed into law in the U.S. Health care reform legislation included an increase in the basic Medicaid rebate rate from 15.1 percent to 23.1 percent and extended the rebate to drugs provided through Medicaid managed care organizations. These Medicaid rebate changes will continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margin of the Pharmaceutical Products segment in future quarters. Beginning in 2013, health care reform legislation will eliminate the federal income tax deduction for prescription drug expenses of retirees for which Abbott receives reimbursement under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program. As a result, Abbott recorded a charge of approximately $60 million in the first quarter 2010 to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities. In 2011, Abbott will begin recording the annual fee imposed by health care reform legislation on companies that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. The amount of the annual fee will be based on the ratio of certain of Abbotts sales as compared to the total such sales of all 45 Table of Contents covered entities multiplied by a fixed dollar amount specified in the legislation by year. In 2011, additional rebates will be incurred related to the Medicare Part D coverage gap "donut hole." Beginning in 2013, Abbott will record the 2.3 percent excise tax imposed by health care reform legislation on the sale of certain medical devices in the U.S. Abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbotts operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 46 Table of Contents  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Financial Instruments and Risk Management Market Price Sensitive Investments Abbott holds available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions. The market value of these investments was approximately $75 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2010 by approximately $15 million. (A 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in share prices.) Non Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $165 million and $78 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Except for one equity investment recorded at $62 million, no other individual investment is in excess of $18 million. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $7.3 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt due in 2011 through 2020. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. At December 31, 2010, Abbott had $2.6 billion of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average annual interest rate of 0.27% with an average remaining life of 24 days. The fair value of long term debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009 amounted to $15.7 billion and $12.3 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 5.2% and 5.3%, respectively) with maturities through 2040. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of current and long term investment securities amounted to approximately $2.1 billion. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or market values. (A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in rates.) Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked to market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Abbott held $10.8 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next twelve months. In addition, certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the 47 Table of Contents products are sold, generally within the next twelve months. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Abbott held $1.3 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the following calendar year. Abbott has designated foreign denominated short term debt of approximately $650 million and approximately $575 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of this debt due to changes in exchange rates are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
