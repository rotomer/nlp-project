ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbotts products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbotts primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals, nutritional products, diagnostic testing products and vascular products. Sales in international markets are approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales. In 2011, Abbott announced a plan to separate into two publicly traded companies, one in diversified medical products and the other in research based pharmaceuticals. To accomplish the separation, Abbott plans to create a new company for its research based pharmaceuticals business which will include Abbotts Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment. The transaction is expected to take the form of a tax free distribution to Abbott shareholders of the stock of the newly created research based pharmaceutical company and is expected to be completed by the end of 2012. Subsequent to the separation, the historical results of the research based pharmaceuticals business will be presented as discontinued operations. Continued robust growth of HUMIRA in a broad range of indications, the acquisitions of Solvays pharmaceuticals business (Solvay Pharmaceuticals) and Piramal Healthcare Limiteds Healthcare Solutions business, continued growth and market penetration by the Xience drug eluting stent franchise, the loss of patent protection for some pharmaceutical products, an ongoing government investigation of Abbotts sales and marketing activities related to Depakote, and the challenging economic environment in many countries around the world have impacted Abbotts sales, costs and financial position over the last three years. Pharmaceutical research and development is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pain management, hepatitis C (HCV), chronic kidney disease and womens health. During the last three years, Abbott acquired the rights to various in process pharmaceutical research and development projects including the development of second generation oral antioxidant inflammation modulators and a product for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. In 2003, Abbott began the worldwide launch of HUMIRA for rheumatoid arthritis, followed by launches for five additional indications, which increased HUMIRAs worldwide sales to $7.9 billion in 2011 compared to $6.5 billion in 2010, and $5.5 billion in 2009. Abbott forecasts low double digit growth for worldwide HUMIRA sales in 2012. Abbott is studying additional indications for HUMIRA. Substantial research and development and selling support has been and continues to be dedicated to maximizing the worldwide potential of HUMIRA. Abbott expects generic competition for TriCor to begin in the second half of 2012. Austerity measures implemented by several European countries reduced healthcare spending and affected pharmaceutical pricing in 2010 and 2011. The 2010 healthcare reform legislation in the U.S. resulted in rebate changes beginning in 2010 and the payment of an annual fee beginning in 2011, which negatively affected Abbotts pharmaceutical business. The impact of the austerity measures and the U.S. healthcare reform legislation is expected to continue. In February 2010, Abbott acquired Solvay Pharmaceuticals which provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expanded Abbotts presence in key global emerging markets. The acquisition added approximately $3.1 billion to Abbotts 2010 total sales, primarily outside the U.S. In September 2010, Abbott completed the acquisition of Piramals Healthcare Solutions business, propelling Abbott to market leadership in the Indian pharmaceutical market and further accelerating the companys growth in emerging markets. In 2011 and 2010, Abbott recorded approximately $345 million and $710 million, respectively, of expense related to the integration of the Solvay business and 28 Table of Contents a restructuring plan announced in September 2010 to streamline operations, improve efficiencies and reduce costs primarily in certain Solvay sites and functions. The restructuring plan is further described below. In 2011, Abbott recorded a litigation charge of $1.5 billion related to ongoing settlement discussions in the U.S. governments investigation related to Depakote. In Abbotts worldwide nutritional products business, favorable economic development in emerging markets and an aging population in developed markets have provided significant opportunities to leverage strong nutritional brands and introduce innovative products. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Abbotts Xience V product became the market leading drug eluting stent in the U.S. In June 2009, Xience PRIME, Abbotts next generation drug eluting stent, received CE Mark approval and was launched in Europe in August 2009. Abbott received approval to market Xience V in Japan in January 2010 and Xience V became the market leading drug eluting stent in Japan in the second quarter of 2010. With the U.S. launches of Xience nano and Xience PRIME in May and November 2011, respectively, and continued strong performance in Japan, China, and other international markets, Xience, which includes Xience V, PRIME and nano, ended 2011 as the market leading drug eluting stent globally. At the same time the third party distributor of the Promus product began transitioning away from the product and that distribution agreement will end in 2012. In 2010, the U.S. government passed health care reform legislation which included an increase in Medicaid rebate rates and the extension of the rebate to drugs provided through Medicaid managed care organizations beginning in 2010. The legislation also imposed annual fees which pharmaceutical manufacturers began paying in 2011 and medical device companies will begin paying in 2013, as well as additional rebates related to the Medicare Part D "donut hole" beginning in 2011. In addition to a 2010 one time charge of approximately $60 million to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy, the legislations negative impact on Abbotts performance grew from more than $200 million in 2010 to approximately $400 million in 2011 and is expected to remain at approximately $400 million in 2012. Abbotts short and long term debt totaled $15.4 billion at December 31, 2011, largely incurred to finance acquisitions. Operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have partially funded acquisitions over the last three years. At December 31, 2011, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard and Poors Corporation and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. In 2012, Abbott will focus on several key initiatives. In the proprietary pharmaceutical business, Abbott will continue maximizing the market potential for HUMIRA and other products, including AndroGel, as well as continuing to build its global presence. Pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to focus a significant portion of expenditures on compounds for immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pain management, HCV, chronic kidney disease and womens health. Current research and development projects are described in the Research and Development Programs section. In the established pharmaceutical business which includes international sales of branded generic products, Abbott will continue to focus on obtaining additional product approvals across numerous countries and expanding its presence in emerging markets. In the vascular business, Abbott will continue to focus on marketing products in the Xience franchise, obtaining regulatory review of the MitraClip device in the U.S., and increasing international MitraClip sales as well as further clinical development of ABSORB, its bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) device and a further roll out of ABSORB in CE Mark countries. In Abbotts other segments, Abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets. Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates Approximately 54 percent of Abbotts consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. 29 Table of Contents Most of these rebates and allowances are in the Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment and the Nutritional Products segment. Abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies, state agencies that administer the federal Medicaid program, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to 24 months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to approximately $5.5 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, or 22.2 percent, 23.1 percent and 23.8 percent, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $24.8 billion, $21.1 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $248 million in 2011. Abbott considers a one percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $409 million, $415 million and $414 million for cash discounts in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $490 million, $537 million and $456 million for returns in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbotts historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel. Management has access to several large customers inventory management data, and for other customers, utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf. These sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel. Except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data. In addition, internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual. In the WIC business, the state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable price, is reliably determinable. Estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott has the WIC business. External data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers the WIC program, participant data from some of the states, and internally administered market research. The USDA has been making its data available for many years. Internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data. At December 31, 2011, Abbott had the exclusive WIC business in 23 states. In the domestic proprietary pharmaceutical business, the most significant charges against gross sales are for Medicaid and Medicare Rebates, Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates and Wholesaler Chargebacks. In order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances, management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time. External data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by Abbott. Management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data. To estimate the price rebate percentage, systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price. Abbotts systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant, and Abbott believes they are reliable. 30 Table of Contents The following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals, which comprise approximately 68 percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2011. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (dollars in millions) Domestic Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products Domestic Nutritionals WIC Rebates Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Pharmacy Benefit Manager Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at January 1, 2009 $ 162 $ 295 $ 228 $ 146 Provisions 747 563 505 1,134 Payments (756 ) (506 ) (494 ) (1,120 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 153 352 239 160 Provisions 616 899 841 1,162 Payments (640 ) (617 ) (670 ) (1,163 ) Balance at December 31, 2010 129 634 410 159 Provisions 575 985 831 1,361 Payments (568 ) (899 ) (735 ) (1,349 ) Balance at December 31, 2011 $ 136 $ 720 $ 506 $ 171 Historically, adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For Medicaid, Medicare and other government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. Income Taxes Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items are often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. In accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbotts federal income tax returns through 2008 are settled except for one item, and the income tax returns for years after 2008 are open. Abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries. Pension and Post Employment Benefits Abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbotts expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for decades, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Low asset returns due to poor market conditions and low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2011, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for Abbotts defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of $3.8 billion and $237 million, respectively. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service 31 Table of Contents attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits. Differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period. Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point. Valuation of Intangible Assets Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which relate to in process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2011, goodwill and intangibles amounted to $15.7 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $1.6 billion in 2011. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2011, 2010 or 2009. In 2011, Abbott recorded impairment charges of $174 million for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects. Litigation Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 450, "Contingencies." Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $1.59 billion to $1.63 billion for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Reserves of approximately $1.6 billion have been recorded at December 31, 2011 for these proceedings and exposures. These reserves represent managements best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, "Contingencies." 32  Table of Contents Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last three years: Components of Change % Total % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2011 vs. 2010 10.5 1.2 6.5 2.8 2010 vs. 2009 14.3 (0.1 ) 13.2 1.2 2009 vs. 2008 4.2 (0.1 ) 8.3 (4.0 ) Total U.S. 2011 vs. 2010 5.4 4.4 1.0 2010 vs. 2009 6.8 0.7 6.1 2009 vs. 2008 0.4 (0.3 ) 0.7 Total International 2011 vs. 2010 14.3 (1.2 ) 10.6 4.9 2010 vs. 2009 20.7 (0.8 ) 19.3 2.2 2009 vs. 2008 7.7 0.2 15.1 (7.6 ) Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2011 vs. 2010 11.0 3.5 5.2 2.3 2010 vs. 2009 13.2 0.3 12.3 0.6 2009 vs. 2008 0.2 (0.2 ) 4.0 (3.6 ) Established Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2011 vs. 2010 19.8 (1.7 ) 17.2 4.3 2010 vs. 2009 53.7 (0.3 ) 51.1 2.9 2009 vs. 2008 (7.6 ) 0.4 (1.1 ) (6.9 ) Nutritional Products Segment 2011 vs. 2010 8.6 3.0 3.6 2.0 2010 vs. 2009 4.7 1.7 1.2 1.8 2009 vs. 2008 7.3 1.5 8.6 (2.8 ) Diagnostic Products Segment 2011 vs. 2010 8.8 (1.1 ) 6.5 3.4 2010 vs. 2009 6.0 0.1 4.3 1.6 2009 vs. 2008 0.1 1.4 3.7 (5.0 ) Vascular Products Segment 2011 vs. 2010 4.4 (4.3 ) 5.5 3.2 2010 vs. 2009 18.6 (4.7 ) 22.3 1.0 2009 vs. 2008 20.1 (2.9 ) 26.0 (3.0 ) In 2011 and 2010, Total Net, Total U.S., Total International, Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment and Established Pharmaceutical Products segment sales reflect the acquisition of Solvays pharmaceuticals business on February 15, 2010 and unit growth, while the relatively weaker U.S. dollar favorably impacted international sales across all segments. Total Net, Total International and Established 33 Table of Contents Pharmaceutical Products segment sales growth in 2011 also reflects the acquisition of Piramal Healthcare Limiteds Healthcare Solution business in September 2010. Total Net Sales growth in 2009 reflects unit growth and the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. on February 25, 2009, partially offset by the negative effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar. Total Net, Total U.S. and Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment sales in 2009 also reflect decreased sales of Depakote due to generic competition. Excluding U.S. Depakote sales, Total Net sales increased 7.7 percent, Total U.S. sales increased 7.6 percent and Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment sales increased 7.8 percent from 2008 to 2009. A comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. 2011 Percent Change 2010 Percent Change 2009 Percent Change (dollars in millions) Proprietary Pharmaceuticals Total U.S. Proprietary sales $ 9,455 8 $ 8,744 12 $ 7,794 (8 ) HUMIRA 3,427 19 2,872 14 2,520 12 TRILIPIX/TriCor 1,372 1 1,355 1 1,337 Niaspan 976 5 927 8 855 9 AndroGel 874 35 649 n/m Lupron 540 12 483 (11 ) 540 43 Synthroid 522 16 451 9 415 (5 ) Kaletra 326 (10 ) 363 (19 ) 447 (13 ) Total International Proprietary sales 7,567 15 6,587 15 5,751 14 HUMIRA 4,505 23 3,676 24 2,969 31 Kaletra 844 (5 ) 892 (3 ) 920 (4 ) Lupron 270 2 265 2 260 (5 ) Total Established Pharmaceuticals 5,413 20 4,519 54 2,941 (8 ) Clarithromycin 542 4 521 (11 ) 587 (8 ) TriCor and Lipanthyl (fenofibrate) 320 29 248 n/m 22 5 Creon 296 58 187 n/m Serc 233 30 180 n/m Duphaston 223 64 136 n/m Synthroid 116 12 104 20 87 (3 ) Nutritionals U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals 1,268 5 1,208 (7 ) 1,306 3 International Pediatric Nutritionals 1,926 15 1,676 9 1,543 12 U.S. Adult Nutritionals 1,368 2 1,345 6 1,269 9 International Adult Nutritionals 1,427 13 1,268 15 1,106 3 Diagnostics Immunochemistry 3,150 8 2,904 4 2,798 (2 ) Vascular Products Coronary Stents 2,078 4 2,007 24 1,618 35 n/m Percent change is not meaningful The increases in U.S. Proprietary product sales in 2011 and 2010 are primarily due to increased sales of HUMIRA and the acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals in February 2010, partially offset by decreased 34 Table of Contents sales of Depakote and Zemplar. U.S. Proprietary product sales in 2009 were impacted by decreased sales of Depakote due to generic competition, partially offset by increased sales of HUMIRA and the addition of Lupron sales from the conclusion of the TAP joint venture in April 2008. U.S. sales of Depakote were $148 million, $161 million and $331 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Worldwide sales of Kaletra in all three years were negatively affected by market competition. International Proprietary product sales in all three years were favorably impacted by increased sales of HUMIRA. The increases in Established Pharmaceutical sales in 2011 and 2010 are primarily due to the acquisitions of Solvay Pharmaceuticals and Piramal and growth in emerging markets. U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals sales in 2011 and 2010 were affected by the voluntary recall of certain Similac brand powder infant formulas in September 2010 and the subsequent recovery in market share in 2011. International Pediatric and Adult Nutritionals sales increases over the three years were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries. International Proprietary Pharmaceuticals, International Adult Nutritionals and Immunochemistry sales in 2011 and 2010 were positively impacted by the effect of the relatively weaker U.S. dollar and were negatively impacted in 2009 by the effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbotts revenue recognition policies as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were approximately $58 million and $120 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, while there were no significant sales in 2011. The expiration of licenses, patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. There are currently no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years. Under a license agreement for TriCor 145 mg, generic competition is not expected before July 2012. Under a license agreement for Trilipix 45 mg and 135 mg, generic competition may begin in January 2014 except that under certain circumstances the license may commence as early as July 2013. Under an agreement relating to Abbotts niacin products and acquired with the Kos Pharmaceuticals acquisition, Niaspan may become subject to generic competition in September 2013. AndroGel 1% sales are expected to be impacted by generic competition in 2015. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 60.0 percent of net sales in 2011, 58.3 percent in 2010 and 57.1 percent in 2009. The increase in the gross profit margin in 2011 was due, in part, to improved margins in the established pharmaceutical, diagnostics and diabetes businesses and was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of exchange on the profit margin ratio. The increase in the gross profit margin in 2010 was due, in part, to improved margins in the established pharmaceutical, vascular, diabetes, diagnostics and nutritional businesses and the favorable effect of exchange on the gross profit margin ratio. The decrease in the gross profit margin in 2009 was due, in part, to the negative impact from lower sales of Depakote and the unfavorable effect of exchange on the gross profit margin ratio; partially offset by improved margins in the vascular and diagnostics businesses. In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. There are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products. These rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the Nutritional, Proprietary Pharmaceutical and Established Pharmaceutical Products segments. Research and development expense was $4.129 billion in 2011, $3.724 billion in 2010 and $2.744 billion in 2009 and represented increases of 10.9 percent in 2011, 35.7 percent in 2010 and 2.0 percent in 2009. Excluding charges related to the Solvay restructurings announced in September 2010, research and development expense increased 29.4 percent in 2010 and 6.2 percent in 2011. The 2010 increase, exclusive of the effects of the restructuring charges, reflects the acquisitions of Solvays pharmaceuticals business in February 2010 and Facet Biotech in April 2010. The increase in 2009 reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which reduced research and development expense in 2009. Excluding 35 Table of Contents the effect of exchange, research and development expenses increased 3.4 percent in 2009. The increases in 2011, 2010 and 2009 also reflect continued pipeline spending, including programs in vascular devices, biologics, neuroscience, oncology and hepatitis C. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products. $2.8 billion of Abbotts 2011 research and development expenses related to Abbotts pharmaceutical products, of which $2.2 billion was directly allocated to the Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment. In 2011, research and development expenditures totaled $403 million for the Vascular Products segment, $325 million for the Diagnostics Products segment, $251 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment and $165 million for the Nutritional Products segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22.9 percent in 2011, increased 23.4 percent in 2010 and decreased 0.4 percent in 2009. The U.S. Department of Justice through the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia is investigating Abbotts sales and marketing activities for Depakote. In 2011, Abbott recorded a litigation charge of $1.5 billion related to ongoing settlement discussions in this investigation. Excluding the litigation charge and Solvay related restructuring and integration costs, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.7 percent in 2011. Excluding charges related to Solvay restructuring and integration projects, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased 18.2 percent. This increase, exclusive of the effects of the restructuring and integration charges, reflects the acquisitions of Solvays pharmaceuticals business in 2010 and Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. in 2009 and higher provisions for litigation in 2010. The 2009 decrease reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which was offset by expenses relating to the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. and the settlement of litigation. Excluding the effects of the charges and exchange, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.9 percent in 2009. The remaining increases in selling, general and administrative expenses over the three year period were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products, including continued spending for HUMIRA, inflation, and in 2010, the impact of the pharmaceutical fee imposed by U.S. healthcare reform legislation. Restructurings In 2011 and prior years, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, Abbott recorded charges of approximately $194 million, $56 million and $114 million, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $76 million in 2011 is classified as Cost of products sold, $69 million as Research and development and $49 million as Selling, general and administrative. Approximately $56 million in 2010 is classified as Cost of products sold and $114 million in 2009 as Selling, general and administrative. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: (dollars in millions) Accrued balance at January 1, 2009 $ 105 2009 restructuring charges 114 Payments, impairments and other adjustments (74 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2009 145 2010 restructuring charges 56 Payments, impairments and other adjustments (124 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2010 77 2011 restructuring charges 194 Payments and other adjustments (94 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2011 $ 177 36  Table of Contents An additional $25 million, $13 million and $47 million were recorded in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. In 2010, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan primarily related to the acquisition of Solvays pharmaceuticals business. This plan streamlines operations, improves efficiencies and reduces costs in certain Solvay sites and functions as well as in certain Abbott and Solvay commercial organizations in various countries. Under this plan, Abbott recorded charges to Cost of products sold, Research and development and Selling, general and administrative of approximately $99 million, $152 million and $272 million, respectively. The following summarizes the activity for this restructuring: (dollars in millions) 2010 restructuring charge $ 523 Payments, impairments and other adjustments (113 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2010 410 Payments and other adjustments (302 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2011 $ 108 An additional $102 million and $12 million were recorded in 2011 and 2010, respectively, relating to this restructuring, primarily for additional employee severance and accelerated depreciation. In 2011 and 2008, Abbott management approved plans to streamline global manufacturing operations, reduce overall costs, and improve efficiencies in Abbotts core diagnostic business. In 2011 a charge of $28 million was recorded in Cost of products sold. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: (dollars in millions) Accrued balance at January 1, 2009 $ 110 Payments and other adjustments (12 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2009 98 Payments and other adjustments (10 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2010 88 2011 restructuring charge 28 Payments and other adjustments (37 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2011 $ 79 In addition, charges of approximately $42 million, $60 million and $54 million were recorded in 2011, 2010 and 2009, primarily for accelerated depreciation and product transfer costs. Additional charges will be incurred through 2012 as a result of product re registration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries and product transition timelines. Interest expense and Interest (income) In 2011, interest expense decreased due to lower debt levels and interest income decreased as a result of lower rates. In 2010, interest expense increased due primarily to increased debt levels. In 2009, interest expense decreased primarily as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by increased debt levels related to the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. Interest income decreased in 2010 due to lower investment balances and decreased in 2009 due to lower interest rates. Change in Accounting Principle and Other (income) expense, net Prior to January 1, 2011, the accounts of foreign subsidiaries were consolidated based on a fiscal year ended November 30 due to the time needed to consolidate these subsidiaries. Effective January 1, 2011, the one month lag in the consolidation of the accounts of foreign subsidiaries was eliminated and the 37 Table of Contents year end of foreign subsidiaries was changed to December 31. Abbott believes that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the one month reporting lag is preferable because it will result in more contemporaneous reporting of the results of foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with applicable accounting literature, a change in subsidiaries year end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. The cumulative effect of the change was an increase in retained earnings of $289 million as of January 1, 2009 and a corresponding decrease in other long term liabilities. The impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods after January 1, 2009, and thus, those results have not been revised. A charge of $137 million was recorded to Other (income) expense, net in 2011 to recognize the cumulative immaterial impacts to 2009 and 2010. Had the financial statements been revised, net sales, operating earnings and net earnings in 2009 would have increased by $211 million, $36 million and $38 million, respectively, and net sales, operating earnings and net earnings in 2010 would have decreased by $21 million, $195 million and $175 million, respectively. Other (income) expense, net, for 2011 includes $56 million of fair value adjustments and accretion in the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Solvays pharmaceutical business. Other (income) expense, net, for 2009 includes the derecognition of a contingent liability of $797 million associated with the conclusion of the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture. The contingent liability was established at the conclusion of the joint venture as Abbott agreed to remit cash to Takeda if certain research and development events were not achieved on the development assets retained by Takeda. In 2009, the research and development events were achieved and the contingent liability was derecognized. In addition, Other (income) expense, net for 2009 includes a $287 million gain from the settlement reached between Abbott and Medtronic, Inc. resolving all outstanding intellectual property litigation between the two parties and income from the recording of certain investments at fair value in connection with business acquisitions. Other (income) expense, net, for 2011, 2010 and 2009 also includes ongoing contractual payments from Takeda associated with the conclusion of the TAP joint venture. Taxes on Earnings The income tax rates on earnings were 9.0 percent in 2011, 19.0 percent in 2010 and 20.1 percent in 2009. Taxes on earnings in 2011 reflect the effect of the tax rate applied to a litigation reserve and the recognition of $580 million of tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years, which also decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $1.3 billion. Exclusive of these discrete items, the effective rates are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to the benefit of lower foreign tax rates and tax exemptions that reduced the tax rates by 22.9, 19.4, and 16.4 percentage points in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The tax rate reductions are primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland and Singapore where Abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules, tax rulings, grants, and exemptions. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate. As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act which were signed into law in 2010, Abbott recorded a charge of approximately $60 million in 2010 to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy. The tax rate in 2009 was affected by a higher tax rate applied to the derecognition of a contingent liability associated with the conclusion of the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture and the Medtronic intellectual property litigation settlement. In October 2010, Puerto Rico enacted legislation that assesses a tax beginning in 2011 on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. This excise tax is recorded in Cost of products sold although the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. 38 Table of Contents Research and Development Programs Abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical and nutritional products in development. Research and Development Process In the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals segment, the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases: Phase I involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers to assess tolerability and potential dosing. Phase II tests the molecules efficacy against the disease in a small group of patients. Phase III tests a molecule that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria. The clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit a New Drug Application (NDA), a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or similar government agencies outside the U.S. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 12 years and can be even longer. There is a significant amount of uncertainty inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products and there is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication. In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, proprietary pharmaceutical research and development projects also may include Phase IV trials, sometimes called post marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. In the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, the research and development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segments existing products to provide Improved Therapeutic Benefits (ITBs) to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity. Depending upon the product, the phases of development may include: Drug product development Phase I bioequivalence studies to compare a future Established Pharmaceuticals brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Phase II studies to test the efficacy of an ITB in a small group of patients. Phase III studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use. The specific requirements (e.g. scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations and new indications. In addition to the development of new ITBs, development projects may also include Phase IV studies similar to the post marketing studies described above for proprietary pharmaceuticals. 39 Table of Contents In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include: Discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area, platform, or unmet clinical need, Concept/Feasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated, testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility, and Development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses. As with pharmaceutical products, the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions. In the U.S., the FDA classifies diagnostic products into classes (I, II, or III) and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval. While the Diagnostics segment has products in all three classes, the vast majority of its products are categorized as Class I or Class II. Submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for Class I products. Class II devices typically require pre market notification to the FDA through a regulatory filing known as a 510(k) submission. Most Class III products are subject to the FDAs Pre Marketing Approval (PMA) requirements. Other Class III products, such as those used to screen blood, require the submission and approval of a BLA. In the EU, diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process, which is governed by the European In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive, depends upon the category. Certain product categories require review and approval by an independent company, known as a Notified Body, before the manufacturer can affix a CE mark to the product to show compliance with the Directive. Other products only require a self certification process. In the Vascular segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design, completion of clinical trials to test the products safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre determined specifications. Similar to the diagnostic products discussed above, in the U.S., vascular products are classified as Class I, II, or III. Most of Abbotts vascular products are classified as Class II devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process or Class III devices that are subject to the PMA process. In the EU, vascular products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which is governed by the European Medical Device Directive, varies by class. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the Directive. Some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self certify its ability to apply the CE mark to the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions. After approval and commercial launch of some vascular products, post market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority. In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants, athletes) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and or region, if claims regarding a products efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. Most 40 Table of Contents other product development, such as a product form change from liquid to powder, generally does not necessitate clinical studies. In the U.S., the FDA requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDAs confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutrition products, notification or pre approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products. Areas of Focus Abbotts significant areas of therapeutic focus include the following: Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products Immunology Projects are ongoing to identify new mechanisms with the potential to treat an array of immune mediated diseases. Projects include early stage work in oral DMARD therapies and a number of biologic candidates. ABT 122 and ABT 981 are both dual variable domain immunoglobulins in Phase I clinical trials with potential to be disease modifying anti arthritic drugs. Additional indications of HUMIRA have registration submissions under review, including ankylosing spondylitis in China where the registration filing was submitted in September 2011 and pediatric Crohns disease where the European Union (EU) registration was submitted in October 2011 and the U.S. submission is expected in mid 2012. Global regulatory applications for ulcerative colitis were submitted in early 2011. Phase III trials are ongoing for ulcerative colitis in Japan, uveitis in the U.S., EU and Japan, peripheral and axial spondyloarthritis in the U.S. and EU, and hidradenitis suppurativa in the U.S. and EU. Approval for juvenile idiopathic arthritis was obtained in July 2011 for Japan. Neuroscience/Pain Abbott is focused on the development of compounds that target receptors in the brain that help regulate neurological functions to address conditions such as Alzheimers disease, schizophrenia, pain, Parkinsons disease and multiple sclerosis (MS). These efforts include four compounds directed toward the treatment of Alzheimers disease. Abbott expects ABT 126 to start Phase IIb studies in the first half of 2012, ABT 354 to enter Phase IIa in late 2012 or early 2013, ABT 363 to complete Phase I in late 2012, and ABT 957 to start Phase I in the first half of 2012. Daclizumab, a next generation antibody, is in ongoing Phase III clinical trials for relapsing remitting MS. ABT 652 is under development for the treatment of multiple pain indications with Phase IIb clinical trials expected to start in June 2012. Duopa is completing its U.S. Phase III program for Parkinsons disease and a registration is expected to be submitted in the second half of 2012. Oncology Abbott is focused on the development of targeted treatments that inhibit tumor growth and improve response to common cancer therapies. Abbott has new molecular entities in development for more than a dozen types of cancer including: ABT 888, a PARP inhibitor, for which Phase II evaluation is ongoing for a number of specific tumor types. Elotuzumab under a collaboration agreement acquired as part of the Facet Biotech acquisition in 2010. Abbott began Phase III development of elotuzumab for the treatment of multiple myeloma with its partner in June 2011. ABT 199, a next generation Bcl 2 inhibitor currently in Phase I development being studied for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL). 41 Table of Contents Hepatitis C Abbotts antiviral program is focused on developing treatments for hepatitis C (HCV) and development is ongoing for ABT 450, part of the Enanta collaboration, polymerase inhibitor ABT 333, and ABT 267, a NS5A inhibitor. Womens Health In 2010, Abbott entered into a collaboration agreement with Neurocrine to develop and commercialize elagolix, an oral gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, for the treatment of endometriosis related pain and fibroids. A Phase III study in endometriosis is expected to begin in mid 2012 and a Phase IIa study for uterine fibroids was initiated in November 2011. Chronic Kidney Disease In 2010, Abbott entered into an agreement with Reata Pharmaceuticals for ex U.S. rights, excluding certain Asian markets, to bardoxolone, an investigational treatment for chronic kidney disease (CKD). A global Phase III trial was initiated in June 2011. A global Phase IIb study was initiated for atrasentan in June 2011. In 2011, new formulations of Abbotts existing pharmaceutical products were approved, including Lupron 6 month depot in June and 3 month depot in August in the U.S. A new strength for Creon was approved in the U.S. in June and AndroGel 1.62% was approved in April in the U.S. Work is also continuing on numerous early stage programs, including the biologic acquired from Pangenetics for chronic pain in late 2009, a cMet antibody for cancer in partnership with Pierre Fabre SA, and other programs across all of Abbotts therapeutic areas of focus. Established Pharmaceuticals Abbott is currently working on active ITB plans for about 20 30 key brands. Depending on the product, the development activities focus on new markets, formulations, combinations, or indications. Vascular Ongoing projects in the pipeline include: Xience Xpedition, our next generation drug eluting stent (DES) with enhanced deliverability and an expanded size matrix. It utilizes the Xience PRIME stent, everolimus and biocompatible coating technology but incorporates new catheter technology for improved deliverability. Submission of the product for CE Mark and U.S. approval is projected to occur in 2012. ABSORB, a bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) device for the treatment of coronary artery disease that is gradually resorbed into the vessel wall. In 2011 Abbott released five year data from its ABSORB clinical trial, which showed efficacy and safety results consistent with the four year data. In 2010, Abbott initiated the ABSORB EXTEND clinical trial which will enroll up to 1,000 patients with more complex coronary artery disease. In 2011 after receiving CE Mark approval for ABSORB, Abbott initiated a randomized, controlled clinical trial to further study the device in an expanded population in Europe. A global trial, including the U.S. and other geographies, is planned for later in 2012. MitraClip device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation Abbotts MitraClip system which is on the market in Europe is currently under review for approval by the FDA. An amended filing to the FDA was submitted in December 2011. Coronary and endovascular core product projects, including new coronary and endovascular guide wires, and the Absolute Pro and Omnilink Elite stent for iliac indication in the U.S., are at various stages of development and or undergoing regulatory approvals. Medical Optics Abbott is expanding its proprietary laser platforms into new vision correction applications, including laser refractive cataract surgery. Abbott has also developed a new diagnostic instrument and laser treatment planning software which is designed to improve visual outcomes. This instrument and software received CE Mark in November 2011 and will be launched in Europe in the second quarter of 2012. A PMA filing for U.S. regulatory approval is targeted for submission in the second quarter of 2012. A PMA filing for an ophthalmic viscoelastic for the U.S. market was submitted to the FDA in February 2011 and is currently under review. Abbott is also developing new products for patients 42 Table of Contents undergoing cataract surgery, including: the Synchrony intraocular lens (IOL) designed to mimic the eyes natural ability to change focus and deliver improved vision at all distances; advanced IOLs that address astigmatism as well as presbyopia; IOL insertion systems that improve surgeon efficiency and enable implantation through smaller incision sizes; and feature enhancements to phacoemulsification systems. Molecular Diagnostics Numerous new molecular diagnostic products, including oncology and infectious disease assays as well as a new instrument system, are currently under development. Abbotts companion diagnostic test for an ALK gene rearrangement test for non small cell lung cancer was launched in the U.S. in 2011 and is currently in clinical trials and undergoing regulatory review in numerous other countries. In 2011, an assay to aid in the management of HCV infected patients undergoing antiviral therapy received U.S. regulatory approval and additional assays to detect the presence of HIV virus and CMV viral load as well as a test to detect hepatitis B drug resistance in patients received CE Mark. Core Laboratory Diagnostics Abbott is researching dozens of novel biomarkers focusing on areas such as infectious disease, oncology, cardiac and neuroscience disorders and also has several next generation instrument systems in development. Diabetes Care Abbott submitted its FreeStyle InsuLinx blood glucose monitoring system that includes new features designed to support the insulin using patient for regulatory approval in the U.S. in June 2011. After receiving CE Mark for this system in May 2011 and Health Canada approval in October 2011, Abbott is continuing to provide R&D support as the product is launched in additional markets. Development is also continuing on an updated hospital blood glucose monitoring system for which filings for approval are projected to be submitted in the U.S. and Europe during the first half of 2013. Abbott is also developing a next generation monitoring system under the Precision product platform. Abbott anticipates submitting filings for approval in various markets in 2013. Nutrition Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: immunity, cognition, lean body mass, inflammation, metabolism and tolerance. Numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development and are expected to be launched in 2012. Given the diversity of Abbotts business, its intention to remain a broad based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project (compound or device) over the next year relative to Abbotts total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbotts overall market position. There were no delays in Abbotts 2011 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations. While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical and medical device projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbotts ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. However, Abbott plans to continue to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately 9.5 percent to 10 percent of sales each year. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period. Generally, Abbott seeks to obtain various forms of exclusivity for each product in development. Abbott obtains patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and or countries for each product in development. Additionally, Abbott also seeks to obtain other forms of legal or regulatory 43 Table of Contents exclusivity that would protect the product upon approval. These forms of regulatory exclusivity have a variety of terms, from 3, 5 to 7 years in the United States, and up to 10 years in the European Union. This regulatory exclusivity is granted upon the approval of each development project. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. The availability of and length of such regulatory exclusivity is based, in part, on the length of the regulatory review process and can only be determined upon product approval. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period of exclusivity that will be obtained if regulatory approval is obtained. Generally, upon approval, products in development may be entitled to exclusivity. Abbott seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents filed on or after June 8, 1995 is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration may be significantly less than 20 years if a product in development ultimately obtains regulatory approval. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension commonly called a patent term restoration for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The calculation of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time extending from the filing of an Investigational New Drug application to the submission of the NDA, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed 5 years and the remaining patent term after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Only one patent related to the first commercial marketing of a newly approved pharmaceutical product is eligible for a patent term restoration. Additionally, products may be entitled to obtain other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. These forms of regulatory exclusivity have a variety of terms in the United States and are variable in other jurisdictions. In the United States, when the FDA approves a new chemical entity that it has not previously approved alone or in combination with other chemical entities, the product is granted 5 years of regulatory exclusivity. The FDA may grant 3 years of market exclusivity for an NDA, including supplementary applications, if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations that have not previously been relied upon by the FDA. If the FDA grants pediatric exclusivity, the longest existing exclusivity (patent or regulatory) related to the product would be extended by 6 months. If the FDA designates a product as an orphan drug that is either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may grant 7 years of exclusivity. This regulatory exclusivity is granted upon the approval of each development project. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period of exclusivity that will be obtained if regulatory approval is obtained. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the minimum and maximum periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed 3 and 14 years, respectively. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may provide some level of additional protection against generic incursion. Business Combinations, Technology Acquisitions and Related Transactions On September 8, 2010, Abbott acquired Piramal Healthcare Limiteds Healthcare Solutions business, a leader in the Indian branded generics market, for $2.2 billion, in cash, plus additional payments of $400 million annually in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Abbott recorded a $1.6 billion liability for the present 44 Table of Contents value of the additional payments at the acquisition date. The acquisition was financed with cash. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in the recording of $2.7 billion of deductible acquired intangible assets and $1.0 billion of deductible goodwill. Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of trade names, customer relationships and associated rights and are amortized over an average of 19 years. In February 2010, Abbott acquired Solvays pharmaceuticals business (Solvay Pharmaceuticals) for approximately $6.1 billion, in cash, plus additional payments of up to EUR 100 million per year if certain sales milestones are met in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Contingent consideration of approximately $290 million was recorded. The acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals provides Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expands Abbotts presence in key global emerging markets. Abbott acquired control of this business on February 15, 2010 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. Net sales for the acquired operations for 2010 were approximately $3.1 billion. Pretax loss of the acquired operations, including acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses, for 2010 was approximately $395 million. The acquisition was funded with cash and short term investments. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition is shown in the table below (in billions of dollars). Goodwill, non deductible $ 2.2 Acquired intangible assets, non deductible 4.1 Acquired in process research and development, non deductible 0.5 Acquired net tangible assets 0.7 Deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition (1.1 ) Total allocation of fair value $ 6.4 Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of product rights for currently marketed products and are amortized over 2 to 14 years (average of 11 years). Acquired in process research and development projects are accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of trade accounts receivable of approximately $675 million, inventory of approximately $390 million, property and equipment of approximately $725 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, accrued compensation and other liabilities. Had the acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals taken place on January 1, 2010 and January 1, 2009, unaudited pro forma net sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share for 2010 and 2009 would have been $35.8 billion and $34.2 billion, $4.6 billion and $5.2 billion and $2.96 and $3.36, respectively. The pro forma information includes adjustments for amortization of intangible assets and fair value adjustments to acquisition date inventory as well as acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses. The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations as they would have been had the transaction been effected on the assumed date. In March 2010, Abbott acquired STARLIMS Technologies for approximately $100 million, in cash, net of cash held by STARLIMS, providing Abbott with leading products and expertise to build its position in laboratory informatics. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition has been allocated to goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. In April 2010, Abbott acquired the outstanding shares of Facet Biotech Corporation for approximately $430 million, in cash, net of cash held by Facet. The acquisition enhances Abbotts early and mid stage pharmaceutical pipeline, including a biologic for multiple sclerosis and compounds that complement Abbotts oncology program. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition has been allocated to acquired in process research and development that is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation. 45  Table of Contents In February 2009, Abbott acquired the outstanding shares of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. (AMO) for approximately $1.4 billion, in cash, net of cash held by AMO. Prior to the acquisition, Abbott held a small investment in AMO. Abbott acquired AMO to take advantage of increasing demand for vision care technologies due to population growth and demographic shifts and AMOs premier position in its field. Abbott acquired control of this business on February 25, 2009 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non deductible goodwill of approximately $1.7 billion, non deductible definite lived intangible assets of approximately $900 million and net tangible assets of approximately $400 million. In addition, Abbott assumed $1.5 billion of debt. Acquired intangible assets consist of established customer relationships, developed technology and trade names and are amortized over 2 to 30 years (average of 15 years). In addition, subsequent to the acquisition, Abbott repaid substantially all of the acquired debt of AMO. In October 2009, Abbott acquired 100 percent of Visiogen, Inc. for $400 million, in cash, providing Abbott with a next generation accommodating intraocular lens (IOL) technology to address presbyopia for cataract patients. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non deductible acquired in process research and development of approximately $200 million which is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, non deductible definite lived intangible assets of approximately $24 million and goodwill of approximately $200 million. In October 2009, Abbott acquired Evalve, Inc. for $320 million, in cash, plus an additional payment of $90 million to be made upon completion of certain regulatory milestones. Abbott acquired Evalve to obtain a presence in the growing area of non surgical treatment for structural heart disease. Including a previous investment in Evalve, Abbott has acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Evalve. In connection with the acquisition, the carrying amount of this investment was revalued to fair value resulting in recording $28 million of income, which is reported as Other (income) expense, net. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non deductible definite lived intangible assets of approximately $140 million, non deductible acquired in process research and development of approximately $220 million which is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, goodwill of approximately $100 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $110 million. Acquired intangible assets consist of developed technology and are being amortized over 11 years. In January 2009, Abbott acquired Ibis Biosciences, Inc. (Ibis) for $175 million, in cash, to expand Abbotts position in molecular diagnostics for infectious disease. Including a $40 million investment in Ibis in 2008, Abbott has acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Ibis. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition has been allocated to goodwill and amortizable intangible assets, and acquired in process research and development which is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The investment in Ibis in 2008 resulted in a charge to acquired in process research and development. In connection with the acquisition, the carrying amount of this investment was revalued to fair value resulting in recording $33 million of income, which is reported as Other (income) expense, net. Except for the acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, had the above acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated net sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. In 2011, Abbott entered into a collaboration agreement for the joint development and commercialization of second generation oral antioxidant inflammation modulators resulting in a charge to acquired in process research and development of $400 million. In 2010, Abbott entered into an agreement to acquire licensing rights outside the U.S., excluding certain Asian markets, to a product in development for the treatment of chronic kidney disease resulting in a charge to acquired in process research and development of $238 million. In 2011, certain milestones were achieved and charges to acquired in process research and development of $188 million were recorded. Additional payments of approximately 46 Table of Contents $200 million could be required for the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. In addition, equity interests of approximately $62 million each were acquired in 2011 and 2010. In 2011, Abbott entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis resulting in a charge to acquired in process research and development of $85 million. Additional payments totaling up to $395 million could be required for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones under the agreement. In 2010, Abbott also entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize a product for the treatment of endometriosis resulting in a charge to acquired in process research and development of $75 million. Additional payments of approximately $500 million could be required for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones under this agreement. In 2009, Abbott acquired the global rights to a novel biologic for the treatment of chronic pain for $170 million resulting in a charge to acquired in process research and development. Goodwill At December 31, 2011, goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled $15.7 billion. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. The results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value except for the Medical Optics unit. While the fair value of the Medical Optics business exceeds its carrying value, extended economic pressure on government reimbursed cataract procedures in Europe and on the global LASIK surgery business as well as longer regulatory approval timelines for products currently under development could result in a valuation in the future where the fair value of the Medical Optics unit has declined below its carrying value, thereby triggering the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill and measure for impairment. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities amounted to $9.0 billion, $8.7 billion and $7.3 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Trade accounts payable and other liabilities in Net cash from operating activities in 2011 includes the non cash impact of a litigation reserve of $1.5 billion and Income taxes payable includes $580 million of tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years. While substantially all of Abbotts cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries, Abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. If these funds were needed for operations in the U.S., Abbott would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes to repatriate these funds. Abbott believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at December 31, 2011 can be considered to be reinvested indefinitely. Abbott funded $394 million in 2011, $525 million in 2010 and $862 million in 2009 to defined pension plans. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of $200 million annually. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends. For 2010, the reductions in cash and cash equivalents due to the effect of exchange rate changes was primarily driven by the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro on non dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents. While future fluctuations in the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could have a substantial effect on the dollar value of Abbotts cash and cash equivalents, such fluctuations are not expected to materially impact Abbotts liquidity. As discussed above, the United States Department of Justice, through the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, is investigating Abbotts sales and marketing activities for Depakote. Abbott recorded a non cash charge of $1.5 billion in 2011 related to this investigation. However, the discussions to resolve potential civil and criminal claims related to this matter are ongoing, and until 47 Table of Contents concluded, there can be no certainty about definitive resolution. The ultimate resolution of this matter in any reporting period is expected to have a material impact on Abbotts cash flows for that year. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2011, Abbotts long term debt rating was AA by Standard & Poors Corporation and A1 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit of $6.7 billion that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements of which a $3.0 billion facility expires in October 2012 and a $3.7 billion facility expires in 2013. Related compensating balances, which are subject to withdrawal by Abbott at its option, and commitment fees are not material. In October 2008, the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of Abbotts common shares from time to time. Under this authorization, 14.8 million and 14.5 million shares were purchased in 2010 and 2009 at a cost of approximately $800 million in both years. No shares were purchased under this authorization in 2011. Abbott plans to purchase shares from time to time in 2012. In 2011, Abbott repaid $2 billion of long term notes using primarily short term borrowings. Under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2009, Abbott issued $3.0 billion of long term debt in the second quarter of 2010 that matures in 2015, 2020 and 2040 with interest rates of 2.7 percent, 4.125 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively. Proceeds from this debt were used to pay down short term borrowings. Abbott is in the process of evaluating the impact of the proposed separation on its future capitalization structure and liquidity. In 2012, Abbott expects to tender for a portion of its outstanding long term debt with the tender funded by debt issued by the new pharmaceutical company. Under the February 2009 registration statement, Abbott issued $3.0 billion of long term debt in the first quarter of 2009 that matures in 2019 and 2039 with interest rates of 5.125 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. Proceeds from this debt were used to fund the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. and to repay debt of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. In addition, Abbott repaid $1 billion of long term notes that were due in 2009 using primarily short term borrowings. The judgment entered in 2009 by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Abbott in its litigation with New York University and Centocor, Inc. required Abbott to secure the judgment in the event that its appeal to the Federal Circuit court was unsuccessful in overturning the district courts decision. In the first quarter of 2010, Abbott deposited $1.87 billion with an escrow agent and considered these assets to be restricted. On February 23, 2011, the Federal Circuit reversed the district courts final judgment and found Centocors patent invalid. On April 25, 2011, Centocor petitioned the Federal Circuit to rehear and reconsider the decision. In June 2011 the Federal Circuit denied Centocors petition and the restrictions on the funds were lifted. Working Capital Working capital was $8.3 billion at December 31, 2011, $5.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and $10.3 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in working capital in 2011 was due primarily to higher cash generated from operating activities and lower debt levels. The decrease in working capital in 2010 was due primarily to cash and investments used to acquire Solvays pharmaceuticals business and Piramal Healthcare Limiteds Healthcare Solutions business. A significant amount of Abbotts trade receivables in Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain are with governmental health systems. Given the economic conditions and sovereign debt issues in these countries, the time it takes to collect outstanding receivables increased in 2011. Outstanding net governmental receivables in these four countries totaled $1.73 billion, $1.50 billion, and $1.59 billion at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The percentage of governmental receivables in these four countries over a year past due was 27 percent, 22 percent, and 23 percent at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. With the exception of Greece, Abbott historically has collected almost all of the outstanding receivables in these countries. Abbott continues to monitor the credit worthiness of customers located in 48 Table of Contents these and other geographic areas and establishes an allowance against a trade receivable when it is probable that the balance will not be collected. If government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur, Abbott may not be able to collect the entire balance. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.5 billion in 2011, $1.0 billion in 2010 and $1.1 billion in 2009 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments placed with customers. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Abbotts estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: (dollars in millions) Payment Due By Period Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 and Thereafter Long term debt, including current maturities and future interest payments $ 20,070 $ 1,882 $ 1,985 $ 3,757 $ 12,446 Operating lease obligations 509 112 161 103 133 Capitalized auto lease obligations 85 28 57 Purchase commitments (a) 3,112 3,004 80 2 26 Other long term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet Benefit plan obligations 3,753 828 924 2,001 Other 4,421 3,851 209 361 Total (b) $ 31,950 $ 5,026 $ 6,962 $ 4,995 $ 14,967 (a)Purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. (b)Unrecognized tax benefits totaling $1.9 billion are excluded from the table above as Abbott is unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities on such items. Contingent Obligations Abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, with other companies which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. In addition, Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an amendment to Topic 270 in the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification. The amendment requires that all non owner changes in 49 Table of Contents stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. Abbott adopted this amendment for the year ended December 31, 2011 and retrospectively presented all non owner changes in stockholders equity in two separate but consecutive statements. Adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on Abbotts results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Legislative Issues In the first quarter 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to herein as "health care reform legislation") were signed into law in the U.S. Health care reform legislation included an increase in the basic Medicaid rebate rate from 15.1 percent to 23.1 percent and extended the rebate to drugs provided through Medicaid managed care organizations. These Medicaid rebate changes will continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margin of the Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment in future years. Beginning in 2013, health care reform legislation will eliminate the federal income tax deduction for prescription drug expenses of retirees for which Abbott receives reimbursement under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program. As a result, Abbott recorded a charge of approximately $60 million in the first quarter 2010 to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities. In 2011, Abbott began recording the annual fee imposed by health care reform legislation on companies that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. The amount of the annual fee will be based on the ratio of certain of Abbotts sales as compared to the total such sales of all covered entities multiplied by a fixed dollar amount specified in the legislation by year. In 2011, additional rebates were incurred related to the Medicare Part D coverage gap "donut hole." Beginning in 2013, Abbott will record the 2.3 percent excise tax imposed by health care reform legislation on the sale of certain medical devices in the U.S. Abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 A Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbotts operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 50  Table of Contents  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management Market Price Sensitive Investments Abbott holds available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions. The market value of these investments was approximately $93 million and $75 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2011 by approximately $18 million. (A 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in share prices.) Non Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $224 million and $165 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. One equity investment is recorded at $124 million with no other individual investment in excess of $18 million. Abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2011 and 2010, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $6.8 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. At December 31, 2011, Abbott had $450 million of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average annual interest rate of 0.07% with an average remaining life of 12 days. The fair value of long term debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 amounted to $15.1 billion and $15.7 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 5.2%) with maturities through 2040. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of current and long term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or market values. (A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in rates.) Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve months. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, Abbott held $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which all mature in the following calendar year. Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked to market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, Abbott held $15.7 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next twelve months. 51 Table of Contents Abbott has designated foreign denominated short term debt of approximately $680 million and approximately $650 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of this debt due to changes in exchange rates are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010: (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Contract Amount Weighted Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) Contract Amount Weighted Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) Receive primarily U.S. Dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 10,526 1.329 $ 102 $ 5,803 1.347 $ 16 British Pound 1,501 1.571 3 1,422 1.581 2 Japanese Yen 2,458 80.3 (3 ) 2,256 82.7 (2 ) Canadian Dollar 280 1.026 (2 ) 538 1.021 4 All other currencies 2,544 N/A (1 ) 2,090 N/A (25 ) Total $ 17,309 $ 99 $ 12,109 $ (5 ) 52  Table of Contents
