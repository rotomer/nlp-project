ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We use the terms Accenture, we, our Company, our and us in this report to refer to Accenture plc, an Irish public limited company, and its subsidiaries or, prior to September 1, 2009, to Accenture Ltd, a Bermuda exempted company that, on that date, became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc, and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to fiscal 2009 means the 12 month period that ended on August 31, 2009. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. Overview Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence. Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges. We add value to clients and drive revenues based on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. The global economic downturn in fiscal 2009 was widespread, leading to economic contraction in many industries and geographies where we operate. It also impacted the needs of our clients and the revenues in our consulting and outsourcing businesses. These changing demand patterns have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our new contract bookings and revenue growth, compared to the prior fiscal year. Revenues before reimbursements (net revenues) for fiscal 2009 were $21.58 billion, compared with $23.39 billion in fiscal 2008, a decrease of 8% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. Net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $5.15 billion, compared with $6.00 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of 14% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency. 40 Table of Contents In our consulting business, net revenues for fiscal 2009 were $12.56 billion, compared with $14.12 billion for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 11% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. Consulting net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $2.91 billion, compared with $3.61 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of 19% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. Starting in January 2009, the global economic downturn led to lower current demand for new consulting services. Many clients are focused on initiatives designed to deliver near and medium term cost savings and performance improvement. Some clients continue to exercise caution and to seek flexibility in launching new large consulting commitments and instead have shifted to a more phased approach to contracting work. Certain clients have slowed the pace of on going projects and or have deferred decisions to expand scope beyond current commitments. In addition, we are experiencing pricing pressures from some clients and in response, where practicable, have shifted to lower cost resources at reduced price levels, particularly in our systems integration business. In our outsourcing business, net revenues for fiscal 2009 were $9.02 billion, compared with $9.27 billion for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 3% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 6% in local currency. Outsourcing net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $2.23 billion, compared with $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of 7% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 1% in local currency. In response to clients seeking to reduce operating costs with requests for price concessions and more favorable contract terms, we have shifted and expect to continue to shift to lower cost resources at a reduced price level. In addition, we have experienced a lower volume of scope expansions on existing contracts. Client strategy changes and consolidations have also resulted in more contract terminations and restructuring, primarily in Financial Services, and to a lesser extent in Communications & High Tech and Resources. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. During the majority of fiscal 2008, the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported U.S. dollar revenues. However, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the U.S. dollar began to strengthen against many currencies and this trend continued until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The foreign exchange impact on our full fiscal 2009 revenue growth was approximately 8% lower growth in U.S. dollars, compared to our growth in local currency. In the future, if the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, our revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower than our growth in local currency. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, our revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher than our growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, sub contractor and other personnel costs, and non payroll outsourcing costs. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client service personnel and the level of non payroll costs associated with the growth of new outsourcing contracts. Utilization represents the percentage of our professionals time spent on billable consulting work. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was approximately 86%, an increase from 83% for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, and was at the top of the range we expected. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was approximately 84%. Sales and marketing expense is driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities, the development of new service offerings and client targeting, image development and brand recognition activities. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non client facing personnel, information systems and office space, which we seek to manage, as a percentage of revenues, at levels consistent with or lower than levels in prior year periods. Operating expenses in fiscal 2009 also included restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and 41 Table of Contents $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future. Restructuring costs are reflected in operating expenses, along with reorganization costs and benefits, which may vary substantially from year to year. Reorganization costs and benefits were immaterial in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 32.3%, compared with 31.7% for fiscal 2008. Gross margin for fiscal 2009 was 31.7%, compared with 30.7% for fiscal 2008. The increase for both periods was driven primarily by improved overall outsourcing contract profitability. Our cost management strategies include anticipating changes in demand for our services and executing cost management initiatives. In addition to the workforce actions included in the Restructuring costs, we aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs and take on going actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have reduced our headcount to approximately 177,000 as of August 31, 2009, compared with more than 186,000 as of August 31, 2008. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for fiscal 2009 was 10%, compared to 16% for fiscal 2008. We evaluate voluntary attrition and have used increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand. Our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to manage headcount, attrition and severance costs, recover increases in compensation and or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 18.3% for fiscal 2009, compared with 17.7% for fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to an increase in selling costs as a percentage of net revenues and a bad debt provision of $75 million, or 0.3% of net revenues. This provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables, in light of the current global economic conditions, particularly from clients in high risk industries or with potential liquidity issues. Operating income for fiscal 2009 was $2,644 million, compared with $3,012 million for fiscal 2008. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for fiscal 2009 was 12.3%, compared with 12.9% for fiscal 2008. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $420 million, compared with $785 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 8.2%, compared with 13.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2009 increased 50 basis points compared with fiscal 2008. Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Due to the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many other currencies, this impact was unfavorable during fiscal 2009. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for Net revenues. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements. 42 Table of Contents Bookings and Backlog New contract bookings for fiscal 2009 were $23.90 billion, with consulting bookings of $12.78 billion and outsourcing bookings of $11.12 billion. New contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $5.54 billion, with consulting bookings of $2.87 billion and outsourcing bookings of $2.68 billion. We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. There are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New contract bookings are recorded using then existing currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for currency fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require Accenture to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time and materials contracts, fixed price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Estimated revenues for applying the percentage of completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or 43 Table of Contents decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities. Contract loss provisions recorded as of August, 31, 2009 and 2008 are immaterial. Revenues from contracts for non technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101), as amended by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition (SAB 104). We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB 101, as amended by SAB 104. Revenues from time and materials or cost plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized on a straight line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs. Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. 44 Table of Contents Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the elements relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. If the amount of non contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non contingent. Fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements. Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed. Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5 10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters. Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out of pocket expenses and third party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions. Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with FIN 48, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. 45 Table of Contents No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions. Revenues by Segment/Operating Group Our five reportable operating segments in fiscal 2009 were our operating groups, which were Communications & High Tech, Financial Services, Products, Public Service and Resources. For presentation purposes, all discussions and operating group financial results relating to periods through the end of our 2009 fiscal year on August 31, 2009 refer to the historical stand alone Public Service operating group, exclusive of the payer and provider components of the Health & Life Sciences industry group, which were included in our Products operating group in fiscal 2009. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. 46 Table of Contents While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors. 47 Table of Contents Results of Operations for Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net revenues (by operating group, geography and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Year Ended August 31, Percent(Decrease)IncreaseUS$ Percent(Decrease)IncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenuesfor the YearEndedAugust 31, 2009 2008 2009 2008 (in millions) OPERATING GROUPS Communications & High Tech $ 4,831 $ 5,450 (11 )% (4 )% 22 % 23 % Financial Services 4,323 5,005 (14 ) (6 ) 20 22 Products 5,530 6,069 (9 ) (1 ) 26 26 Public Service 2,984 2,871 4 11 14 12 Resources 3,880 3,963 (2 ) 8 18 17 Other 29 29 n/m n/m TOTAL Net Revenues 21,577 23,387 (8 )% 100 % 100 % Reimbursements 1,594 1,927 (17 ) TOTAL REVENUES $ 23,171 $ 25,314 (8 )% GEOGRAPHY Americas $ 9,403 $ 9,726 (3 )% % 44 % 42 % EMEA(1) 9,904 11,546 (14 ) (2 ) 46 49 Asia Pacific 2,270 2,115 7 12 10 9 TOTAL Net Revenues $ 21,577 $ 23,387 (8 )% 100 % 100 % TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 12,556 $ 14,117 (11 )% (4 )% 58 % 60 % Outsourcing 9,021 9,270 (3 ) 6 42 40 TOTAL Net Revenues $ 21,577 $ 23,387 (8 )% 100 % 100 % n/m not meaningful (1) EMEA includes Europe, Middle East and Asia. We conduct business in the following countries that individually comprised more than 10% of consolidated net revenues within the three years ended August 31, 2009: Year Ended August 31, 2009 2008 2007 United States 36 % 34 % 36 % United Kingdom 10 12 14 Results of Operations for Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net Revenues Since January 2009, our business has been affected by the continuing global economic downturn. Many clients have delayed new large consulting commitments, have slowed the pace of on going projects and have reduced requests for incremental projects. In addition, in response to clients seeking to reduce 48 Table of Contents operating costs with requests for price concessions, where practicable, we have shifted to lower cost resources at a reduced price level. As a result, most of our operating groups experienced either declines in or lower local currency growth in consulting revenues beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Consulting revenues declined 12% in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, primarily due to declines in Communications & High Tech of 26%, Products of 22%, Financial Services of 12% and Resources of 5%, partially offset by local currency growth in Public Service of 19%. In addition, most of our operating groups experienced lower local currency growth in outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008. In the fourth quarter, outsourcing revenue growth in local currency slowed to 1%, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as growth in Products of 9%, Resources of 5% and Public Service of 2% was offset by declines in Financial Services of 8% and Communications & High Tech of 2%. The following net revenues by operating group commentary discusses local currency net revenues changes in aggregate for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008: Communications & High Tech net revenues decreased 4% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined 11% in local currency, with growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, more than offset by year over year contraction during the last three quarters. The aggregate local currency decline was due to declines across all industry groups in the Americas and EMEA regions. These declines were partially offset by consulting growth across all industry groups in the Asia Pacific region. Client strategy changes, particularly in Communications, have resulted in a number of contract modifications in fiscal 2009, which have had a negative impact on consulting revenues in fiscal 2009 and will continue to have a negative impact in fiscal 2010. Outsourcing revenues increased 4% in local currency, primarily driven by growth across all industry groups in the Asia Pacific region and in Electronics & High Tech and Media & Entertainment in the EMEA region, partially offset by a decline in Communications in the EMEA region. Financial Services net revenues decreased 6% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined 11% in local currency, primarily due to declines in Banking in the EMEA region and, to a lesser extent, in Insurance and Capital Markets in the Americas region. These declines were partially offset by consulting growth in Banking in the Americas region and in Capital Markets in the EMEA region. Outsourcing revenues increased 2% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Banking in the EMEA region and in Insurance in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, partially offset by declines in Capital Markets in the Americas and EMEA regions. Client strategy changes and consolidations in the financial services industry have resulted in a number of outsourcing contract terminations, which have had a negative impact on our revenues, contributing to a decline in outsourcing revenues during the second half of fiscal 2009. Products net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined by 8% in local currency, with growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, more than offset by year over year contraction during the last three quarters. The aggregate local currency decline was primarily due to declines in the EMEA region across all industry groups except Retail and in the Americas region across all industry groups except Consumer Goods & Services. Outsourcing revenues increased 10% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Consumer Goods & Services, Health & Life Sciences and Transportation & Travel Services across all geographic regions. Public Service net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased 16% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in the Americas region. Outsourcing revenues increased 3% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in the EMEA region, partially offset by a decline in the Americas region. Resources net revenues increased 8% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased 7% in local currency, with strong growth in the first half of fiscal 2009, partially offset by year over year 49 Table of Contents contraction during the second half. The aggregate growth was led by Utilities in the EMEA region and Natural Resources in the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by a decline in Chemicals in the EMEA region. Outsourcing revenues increased 8% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Utilities and Energy in the EMEA region and growth in Utilities in the Americas region. In the Americas region, net revenues were $9,403 million for fiscal 2009, compared with $9,726 million for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 3% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. We experienced growth in local currency in Brazil, driven by strong growth during the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, which moderated to flat growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This growth was offset by declines in the United States and Canada, where growth early in the year was more than offset by lower growth and or declines that began in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In the EMEA region, net revenues were $9,904 million for fiscal 2009, compared with $11,546 million for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 14% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency. In general, growth moderated or declined across the EMEA region beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, led by declines in local currency in the United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Ireland and Sweden. In the Netherlands and Germany we experienced growth in local currency for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a fourth quarter decline in Germany and flat growth in the Netherlands. In the Asia Pacific region, net revenues were $2,270 million for fiscal 2009, compared with $2,115 million for fiscal 2008, an increase of 7% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. Growth in local currency was principally driven by our business in Australia and Singapore. In Japan we experienced growth in local currency for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a fourth quarter decline. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2009 were $20,527 million, a decrease of $1,775 million, or 8%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 88.6% from 88.1% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2009 were $18,933 million, a decrease of $1,442 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 87.7% from 87.1% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2009 was $16,330 million, a decrease of $1,798 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.5% from 71.6% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2009 was $14,736 million, a decrease of $1,465 million, or 9%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.3% from 69.3% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2009 was 31.7%, an increase from 30.7% in fiscal 2008, driven primarily by improved overall outsourcing contract profitability. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009 was $2,159 million, a decrease of $111 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.0% from 9.7% over this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to an increase in selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2009 were $1,789 million, a decrease of $92 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 8.3% from 8.0% over this period. 50 Table of Contents The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to a bad debt provision of $75 million, or 0.3% of net revenues. This provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables, in light of global economic conditions, particularly from clients in high risk industries or with potential liquidity issues. Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net We recorded restructuring costs of $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future. We recorded net reorganization benefits of $3 million for fiscal 2009, which included a $16 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by $13 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities. We recorded net reorganization costs of $23 million for fiscal 2008, related to interest expense associated with carrying the liabilities. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August 31, 2009, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $296 million, of which $287 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months. However, resolution of current tax audits, initiation of additional audits or litigation may delay final settlements. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2009 was $2,644 million, a decrease of $368 million, or 12%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as percentage of net revenues to 12.3% from 12.9% during this period. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2009 increased 50 basis points compared with fiscal 2008.

We have presented Operating income and operating margin excluding restructuring costs, because the restructuring costs meaningfully affect the comparability of our results of operations between periods. We believe that providing investors with this information gives additional insights into our on going results of operations. (2) May not total due to rounding. While we have seen our net revenues contract, due to both the current global economic downturn and significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we have improved our gross margins by focusing on contract profitability, particularly in our outsourcing business. This improvement was partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. In addition, each operating group recorded a portion of the $75 million bad debt provision and a portion of the $253 million restructuring cost. See General and Administrative Costs and Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net. During fiscal 2009, we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating income is similar to that disclosed for net revenues. The operating group commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2009, compared to fiscal 2008, exclusive of foreign exchange rate, bad debt provision and restructuring impacts. Communications & High Tech operating income increased due to improved outsourcing and consulting contract margins, offset by consulting revenue declines. In addition, fiscal 2008 reflected the impact of delivery inefficiencies on a small number of consulting contracts. Financial Services operating income decreased, primarily due to consulting revenue declines, a lower proportion of high margin consulting work and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by improved outsourcing contract margins. Products operating income decreased due to declines in consulting revenue and consulting contract margins, early stage work at lower margins on a few large contracts in the fourth quarter and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by improved outsourcing contract margins. Public Service operating income increased due to resolution of a contract termination and improved delivery efficiencies compared with fiscal 2008 and consulting revenue growth. Resources operating income increased due to revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract margins, partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. 52 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income was $50 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $65 million, or 56%, from fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2009 and 2008 were 27.6% and 29.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower expenses related to tax rate changes and other adjustments to prior year tax liabilities required in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Minority Interest Minority interest eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See Business Organizational Structure. The resulting Net income of Accenture Ltd represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture Ltd. Since January 2002, minority interest has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to minority shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Minority interest was $348 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $157 million, or 31%, from fiscal 2008. The change was due to a $259 million decrease in Income before minority interest and a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average minority ownership interests to 17% for fiscal 2009 from 22% for fiscal 2008. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.44 for fiscal 2009, compared with $2.65 for fiscal 2008. The $0.21 decrease in our earnings per share was primarily the result of $253 million in pre tax restructuring costs, which reduced earnings per share by $0.24. Absent the restructuring costs, earnings per share increased $0.03 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following: Increases of $0.11 from growth in revenues and operating income in local currency, $0.11 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, and $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.20 from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, compared with fiscal 2008, and $0.05 from other items, including reorganization benefits and non operating items. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 53 Table of Contents Results of Operations for Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Net revenues (by operating group, geography and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Year Ended August 31, PercentIncreaseUS$ PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenuesfor the Year EndedAugust 31, 2008 2007 2008 2007 (in millions) OPERATING GROUPS Communications & High Tech $ 5,450 $ 4,600 18 % 10 % 23 % 23 % Financial Services 5,005 4,357 15 6 22 22 Products 6,069 4,913 24 17 26 25 Public Service 2,871 2,561 12 7 12 13 Resources 3,963 3,243 22 14 17 17 Other 29 22 n/m n/m TOTAL Net Revenues 23,387 19,696 19 % 11 % 100 % 100 % Reimbursements 1,927 1,757 10 TOTAL REVENUES $ 25,314 $ 21,453 18 % GEOGRAPHY Americas $ 9,726 $ 8,483 15 % 12 % 42 % 43 % EMEA 11,546 9,534 21 10 49 48 Asia Pacific 2,115 1,679 26 15 9 9 TOTAL Net Revenues $ 23,387 $ 19,696 19 % 11 % 100 % 100 % TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 14,117 $ 11,856 19 % 11 % 60 % 60 % Outsourcing 9,270 7,840 18 11 40 40 TOTAL Net Revenues $ 23,387 $ 19,696 19 % 11 % 100 % 100 % n/m not meaningful Net Revenues The following net revenues by operating group commentary discusses local currency revenues changes for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007: Communications & High Techs net revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by solid consulting and outsourcing growth. The consulting increase was driven by growth in the EMEA region across all industry groups. The outsourcing increase was led by growth in our Communications industry group across all geographic regions and in our Electronics & High Tech industry group in the Asia Pacific region. Financial Services net revenues increased 6% in local currency, primarily due to outsourcing growth in our Banking industry group across all geographic regions and in our Insurance and Capital Markets industry groups in the Americas region. Consulting growth in our Banking and Insurance industry groups in the Americas region and in our Banking industry group in the Asia Pacific region was offset by a consulting revenue decline in the EMEA region, principally in our Banking and Capital Markets industry groups. During the first nine months of fiscal 2008, we 54 Table of Contents recorded modest growth in our Financial Services consulting business. However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we experienced a slight year over year decline in our consulting business. Products net revenues increased 17% in local currency, driven by strong consulting and outsourcing growth across all geographic regions. The consulting growth was led by our Retail and Health & Life Sciences industry groups in the Americas region and by our Consumer Goods & Services, Retail and Industrial Equipment industry groups in the EMEA region. The outsourcing growth was led by our Health & Life Sciences and Consumer Goods & Services industry groups in the Americas region and by our Consumer Goods & Services, Automotive and Industrial Equipment industry groups in the EMEA region. Public Service net revenues increased 7% in local currency, primarily due to consulting growth across all geographic regions, led by strong growth in the EMEA and Americas regions, partially offset by an outsourcing decline in the Americas region. Resources net revenues increased 14% in local currency, primarily driven by strong consulting growth across all geographic regions, led by our Utilities and Natural Resources industry groups, and by solid outsourcing growth, led by our Utilities and Energy industry groups in the Americas region. In the Americas region, we achieved net revenues of $9,726 million for fiscal 2008, compared with $8,483 million for fiscal 2007, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. Growth was principally driven by our business in the United States, Brazil and Canada. In the EMEA region, we achieved net revenues of $11,546 million for fiscal 2008, compared with $9,534 million for fiscal 2007, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency. Growth was led by our business in Italy, Spain and France. In the Asia Pacific region, we achieved net revenues of $2,115 million in fiscal 2008, compared with $1,679 million for fiscal 2007, an increase of 26% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. Growth was principally driven by our business in Japan, China and Singapore. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were $22,302 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $3,342 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 88.1% from 88.4% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses were $20,375 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $3,172 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 87.1% from 87.3% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services was $18,128 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $2,717 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 71.6% from 71.8% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses was $16,201 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $2,547 million, or 19%, over fiscal 2007, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 69.3%. Gross margin (net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) remained flat at 30.7% during this period. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense was $2,271 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $367 million, or 19%, over fiscal 2007, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 9.7% during this period. 55 Table of Contents General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs were $1,880 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $262 million, or 16%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 8.0% from 8.2% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to strong revenue growth and our management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of our net revenues. Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net We recorded net reorganization costs of $23 million and $26 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to interest expense associated with carrying the reorganization liabilities. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August 31, 2008, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $309 million, of which $299 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months. However, resolution of current tax audits, initiation of additional audits or litigation may delay final settlements. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Operating Income Operating income was $3,012 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $519 million, or 21%, from fiscal 2007. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 12.9% and 12.7% in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to outsourcing revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract margins, partially offset by a decline in contract margins due to a lower proportion of high margin consulting contracts. In addition, operating income for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of delivery inefficiencies on several contracts. Products operating income increased due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability. Public Service operating income decreased slightly in fiscal 2008. Consulting revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract margins were more than offset by profitability challenges, 56 Table of Contents including delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts, revenue adjustments on certain contracts and higher selling costs associated with business development opportunities which fueled strong fourth quarter fiscal 2008 bookings. The fiscal 2007 operating income also reflects asset impairments associated with an outsourcing contract recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Resources operating income increased primarily due to strong revenue growth. Gain on Investments, net Gain on investments, net was $6 million in fiscal 2008, a decrease of $12 million from fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2007 gain was primarily from a gain on the sale of a remaining investment from our portfolio of investments that was written down in fiscal 2002. Interest Income Interest income was $115 million in fiscal 2008, a decrease of $40 million, or 26%, from fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates. Other Expense, net Other expense, net was $2 million in fiscal 2008, a decrease of $20 million from fiscal 2007. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in net foreign currency exchange losses. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2008 and 2007 were 29.3% and 34.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2008 primarily as a result of benefits related to: final determinations of prior year tax liabilities, which reduced the rate by 3.9%; non US research and development tax credits, which reduced the rate by 1.3%; and changes in the geographic distribution of income. These benefits were offset by expenses related to tax rate changes enacted during fiscal 2008, which reduced the value of our deferred tax assets. Fiscal 2007 included a reduction in the effective tax rate of 0.8%, recorded as a result of a nonrecurring benefit related to a reduction in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Minority Interest Minority interest eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See Business Organizational Structure. The resulting Net income of Accenture Ltd represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture Ltd. Since January 2002, minority interest has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to minority shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Minority interest was $505 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $26 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Income before minority interest of $474 million, partially offset by a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average minority ownership interests to 22% for fiscal 2008 from 27% for fiscal 2007. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.65 in fiscal 2008, compared with $1.97 in fiscal 2007. The $0.68 increase in our earnings per share was primarily the result of the following: $0.25 from strong 57 Table of Contents growth in revenues and operating income in local currency; $0.19 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.12 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, partially offset by $0.02 from lower non operating income. In addition, favorable foreign currency exchange rates accounted for $0.14 of the increase. For information regarding our earnings per share calculation, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, debt capacity available under various credit facilities and available cash reserves. We may also be able to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to: take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; acquire complementary businesses or technologies; develop new services and solutions; respond to competitive pressures; or facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of Accenture shares. As of August 31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents was $4,542 million, compared with $3,603 million as of August 31, 2008, an increase of $939 million. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Year Ended August 31, 2009 2008 2007(1) 2009 to 2008Change(1) (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,160 $ 2,803 $ 2,631 $ 357 Investing activities (245 ) (324 ) (350 ) 79 Financing activities (1,850 ) (2,162 ) (2,128 ) 311 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (126 ) (29 ) 95 (96 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 939 $ 288 $ 247 $ 651 (1) May not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $357 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non current unbilled services and deferred revenues), partially offset by changes in other operating assets and liabilities. Cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2008 also reflected a payment of $143 million to settle tax audits related to reorganization liabilities. Investing activities: The $79 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in spending on business acquisitions and lower spending on property and equipment partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of available for sale investments. Financing activities: The $311 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of common shares, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 14 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 58 Table of Contents We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Borrowing Facilities As of August 31, 2009, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: Facility Amount BorrowingsUnderFacilities (in millions) Syndicated loan facility(1) $ 1,200 $ Separate bilateral, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities(2) 350 Local guaranteed and non guaranteed lines of credit(3) 188 Total $ 1,738 $ (1) This facility, which matures on July 31, 2012, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. This facility requires us to: (1) limit liens placed on our assets to (a) liens incurred in the ordinary course of business (subject to certain qualifications) and (b) other liens securing obligations not to exceed 30% of our consolidated assets; and (2) maintain a debt to cash flow ratio not exceeding 1.75 to 1.00. We continue to be in compliance with these terms. As of August 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no borrowings under the facility. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. (2) We maintain two separate bilateral, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the bilateral revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of August 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no borrowings and $5 million, respectively, of borrowings under these facilities. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under these multicurrency credit facilities and lines of credit, based on the average annual balances, was approximately 4% in fiscal 2009 and 8% in fiscal 2008. (3) We also maintain local guaranteed and non guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of August 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no borrowings under these various facilities. Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $172 million and $169 million of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $1 million and $3 million as of August 31, 2009 and 2008. Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture Ltd has authorized funding for our publicly announced open market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture Ltd Class A common shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees. 59 Table of Contents A summary of our share purchase activity for cash during fiscal 2009 is as follows: Accenture Ltd Class ACommon Shares Accenture SCA Class ICommon Shares and AccentureCanada Holdings Inc.Exchangeable Shares Total Shares Amount Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions, except share amounts) Open market share purchases(1) 18,925,568 $ 571 $ 18,925,568 $ 571 Other share purchase programs 33,242,107 1,080 33,242,107 1,080 Other purchases(2) 5,881,300 204 5,881,300 204 Total 24,806,868 $ 775 33,242,107 $ 1,080 58,048,975 $ 1,855 (1) We conduct a publicly announced, open market share purchase program for Accenture Ltd Class A common shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by one or more subsidiaries of Accenture Ltd and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During fiscal 2009, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture Ltd Class A common shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares under those plans. As of August 31, 2009, our aggregate available authorization was $852 million for our publicly announced open market share purchase program and the other share purchase programs. Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2009, we issued 1,125,645 Accenture Ltd Class A common shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S 3 (the registration statement) filed on May 15, 2007. The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture Ltd Class A common shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by our senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees. Subsequent Developments On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Transaction). On August 5, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, voted in favor of the Transaction. The Transaction was subsequently completed on September 1, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Accenture Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company. In the Transaction, all of the outstanding Class A and Class X common shares of Accenture Ltd were cancelled and Accenture plc issued Class A and Class X ordinary shares on a one for one basis to the holders of the cancelled Accenture Ltd Class A and Class X common shares, as applicable. The transaction has no impact on our financial condition or results of operations. On September 1, 2009, we filed an amendment to our registration statement to enable us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by our senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees. On September 30, 2009, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a cash dividend of $0.75 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 16, 2009. Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a cash dividend of $0.75 per share on its Class I common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 13, 2009. Both dividends are payable on November 16, 2009. 60 Table of Contents On September 30, 2009, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $4.0 billion in additional share repurchase authority, bringing Accentures total outstanding authority to approximately $4.9 billion. Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2009, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Contractual Cash Obligations(1)(2) Total Less than1 year 1 3years 3 5years More than5 years (in millions) Long term debt $ 1 $ 1 $ $ $ Operating leases 1,968 400 521 322 725 Retirement obligations(3) 135 29 28 23 55 Other commitments(4) 115 40 43 29 3 Total $ 2,219 $ 470 $ 592 $ 374 $ 783 (1) We adopted FIN 48 on September 1, 2007. The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note 10 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (2) In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August 31, 2009, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $296 million, of which $287 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months. The reorganization liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (3) This represents projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre incorporation partners. Because these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001. (4) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights. Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the clients claim. Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and or amount. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. 61 Table of Contents To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 16 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). This Statement requires enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities about (i) how and why a company uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related interpretations, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a companys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. On December 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 161 and it did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. On September 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with FASB Staff Position 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, we elected to defer the adoption of the provisions of SFAS 157 for our non financial assets and non financial liabilities. Such assets and liabilities, which include our Deferred contract costs, Property and equipment, net and Goodwill, will be subject to the provisions of SFAS 157 on September 1, 2009. We are currently assessing the potential impact the adoption of SFAS 157 for non financial assets may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see Note 8 (Fair Value Measurements) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Effective September 1, 2008, we adopted the year end measurement date provision of SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 106, and 132(R), using an approach generally known as the one measurement approach. The adoption of the provision had the following impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheet: decreased Retained earnings by $5.3 million, decreased Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by $0.3 million, decreased Other non current assets by $2.7 million and increased Retirement obligation by $2.9 million. On March 1, 2009, we adopted SFAS 165, Subsequent Events (SFAS 165), which establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. SFAS 165 sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The adoption of SFAS 165 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which is a revision of SFAS 141, Business Combinations. SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for: recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed 62 Table of Contents and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; expensing acquisition related costs as incurred; and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 141R for acquisitions that occur on or after September 1, 2009. The impact of SFAS 141R on our Consolidated Financial Statements will depend on the size and nature of any acquisitions on or after September 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (previously referred to as minority interests). Upon adoption of SFAS 160 on September 1, 2009, we will be required to report any noncontrolling interests as a separate component of Consolidated Shareholders Equity. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Brazilian real, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.K. pound/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by Accentures Global Delivery Network. For designated cash flow hedges, gains (losses) currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of Services. As of August 31, 2009, it is anticipated that $8 million of the net loss, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income will be reclassified into Cost of Services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $180 million and $146 million as of August 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 63 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2009 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Equity Price Risk The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
