We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.  ACQUISITION OF MACROMEDIA On December 3, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Macromedia for approximately $3.4 billion. We expect the acquisition to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We expect our revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses to increase in the future, but we also anticipate cost saving synergies. In addition, we expect to incur estimated restructuring charges of $20 million to $25 million in the next fiscal year, primarily in the first quarter. Coinciding with the integration of Macromedia and the start of our 2006 fiscal year, we changed the reporting of our principal business segments to be aligned with our market opportunities and how we manage our various businesses. The discussions in this section of the Annual Report on Form 10 K, as well as the financial statements contained herein, relate to Adobe as a standalone entity and do not reflect the impact of the acquisition.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of creative, business and mobile software and services used by high end consumers, creative professionals, designers, knowledge workers, OEM partners, developers and enterprises for creating, managing, delivering and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs; direct to end users; and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to major hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Our software runs on Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, Linux, UNIX and various non personal computer platforms, depending on the product.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We also discuss our critical accounting estimates 43 with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our critical accounting policies, see the discussion in the section titled "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" below and Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change. Our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates. In applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions, if any, must be deferred. In order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services. Our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We have to estimate provisions for returns which are recorded against our revenues. In determining our estimate for returns, and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. More or less product may be returned from what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. 44   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 revised 2004 ("SFAS 123R"), "Share Based Payment" which replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 ("SFAS 123"), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS 123R requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income. In April 2005, the SEC announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we are now required to adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. See Note 1 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under SFAS 123R to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards. We are evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share. See Note 1 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding other recent accounting pronouncements.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2005 During fiscal 2005, we continued to focus on delivering comprehensive technology platforms to our customers to drive revenue and earnings growth. In our Intelligent Document business, we achieved year over year growth primarily due to our Acrobat 7.0 family of products which began shipping in the first quarter. Acrobat 7.0 has numerous new features to help drive increased adoption by users in enterprises, governments and specialized vertical markets such as architecture, engineering and construction. We also achieved year over year growth in our Creative Professional business due primarily to the release of version 2 of our Adobe Creative Suite products beginning in the second quarter of the fiscal year. Creative Suite 2.0 integrates new full versions of Adobes design and publishing software, along with Version Cue CS2 and a new visual file browser called Adobe Bridge. Beginning in fiscal 2004, many customers began licensing Photoshop capabilities via the Creative Suite products, as opposed to licensing the standalone version of the product. This planned migration has impacted the revenues from our Digital Imaging and Video business segment. However, our total revenue in the Digital Imaging and Video business grew in fiscal 2005 due to the strength of our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements software bundle, new versions of which were released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Revenue Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Product $ 1,923.3 18 % $ 1,634.0 29 % $ 1,269.0 Percentage of total revenues 98 % 98 % 98 % Services and support 43.0 32 % 32.6 27 % 25.7 Percentage of total revenues 2 % 2 % 2 % Total revenues $ 1,966.3 18 % $ 1,666.6 29 % $ 1,294.7 In fiscal 2005, we had four reportable segments: Digital Imaging and Video, Creative Professional, Intelligent Document, and OEM PostScript and Other. The Digital Imaging and Video segment provides 45 users with software for creating, editing, enhancing and sharing digital images and photographs, digital video, audio and animations. The Creative Professional segment provides software for professional page layout, professional Web page layout, graphic and illustration creation, technical document publishing and business publishing. Additionally, this segment includes Photoshop and Acrobat Professional as part of its Adobe Creative Suite products. The Intelligent Document segment provides electronic document distribution software that allows users to create, enhance, annotate and securely send Adobe PDF files that can be shared, viewed, navigated and printed exactly as intended on a broad range of hardware and software platforms. In addition, this segment provides server based solutions for enterprises, in the areas of document generation, document process management, document collaboration, and document control and security. The OEM PostScript and Other segment includes printing technology used to create and print simple or visually rich documents with precision. Our services and support revenue is composed of professional services (such as consulting services and training) and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our Intelligent Document server solution products. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our professional services revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Segment Information Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Digital Imaging and Video $ 432.8 1 % $ 430.2 10 % $ 392.4 Percentage of total revenues 22 % 26 % 30 % Creative Professional 743.8 21 % 613.1 66 % 368.5 Percentage of total revenues 38 % 37 % 29 % Intelligent Document 708.0 31 % 541.8 22 % 444.1 Percentage of total revenues 36 % 32 % 34 % OEM PostScript and Other 81.7 % 81.5 (9 )% 89.7 Percentage of total revenues 4 % 5 % 7 % Total revenues $ 1,966.3 18 % $ 1,666.6 29 % $ 1,294.7 Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 with the completion of our acquisition of Macromedia, we changed the reporting of our business segments to be aligned with our market opportunities and how we manage our combined businesses. Our new business segments are Creative Solutions, Knowledge Worker Solutions, Enterprise and Developer Solutions, Mobile and Device Solutions, and Other. The management discussion and analysis that follows is based on the segment reporting that was in effect throughout fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenue Revenue from our Digital Imaging and Video segment grew slightly for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The growth in the segment was due to the 3% increase in revenues from our digital imaging software products as a result of new releases of our Adobe Photoshop Elements product as well as the new software bundle that combines our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements products. Revenue from our Creative Professional segment increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a 32% increase in revenues from the new versions of our Adobe Creative Suite 46 products which were released during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2005. Revenue from our Intelligent Document segment increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a 36% increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products. The increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products is due to continued adoption of Acrobat desktop products by enterprises and technical professionals, as well as the release of Acrobat 7.0 during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Revenue from our Intelligent Document LiveCycle products increased approximately 10% during fiscal 2005 due to increased licensing and server support revenue, as we continue to focus on both the government sector and financial services. Additionally, revenue from our Intelligent Document segment increased during fiscal 2005 due to an increase in consulting revenues. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2005. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment remained relatively flat during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Revenue from this segment has declined over the last few years and we expect this trend to continue. Fiscal 2004 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2003 Revenue Revenue from our Digital Imaging and Video segment increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to increases in revenues from both our digital video and digital imaging software products. Revenue from our digital video software products increased 9% during fiscal 2004 which was attributable to new releases during fiscal 2004. Revenue from our digital imaging software products increased 10% during fiscal 2004 due to continued success with Adobe Photoshop CS which was released at the end of fiscal 2003 as well as the release of Photoshop Elements 3.0 in fiscal 2004. Revenue from our Creative Professional segment increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the continued strength of our Adobe Creative Suite products which were initially released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The increase in revenues from our Adobe Creative Suite products were partially offset by decreases in revenues in our business and technical page layout software products due to product lifecycle timing. Revenue from our Intelligent Document segment increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to a 17% increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products as a result of continued adoption of Acrobat desktop products launched in fiscal 2003. Additionally, revenue from our Intelligent Document server based products increased 50% due to increased licensing and server support revenue. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment decreased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to a decline in pricing resulting from competition from clone PostScript technologies and lower prices of output devices. Geographic Information Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Americas $ 939.7 22 % $ 770.6 20 % $ 640.2 Percentage of total revenues 48 % 46 % 49 % EMEA 612.7 13 % 541.5 46 % 370.2 Percentage of total revenues 31 % 33 % 29 % Asia 413.9 17 % 354.5 25 % 284.3 Percentage of total revenues 21 % 21 % 22 % Total revenues $ 1,966.3 18 % $ 1,666.6 29 % $ 1,294.7 47 Revenue in the Americas increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to the strength of our Digital Imaging and Video, Creative Professional and Intelligent Document products. Revenue in EMEA and Asia increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to the strength of our Creative Professional and Intelligent Document products. The increase in revenues, in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, in each of our geographic segments was primarily due to the strength of our Creative Professional products. Additionally, due to the strength of the euro and the yen, revenues in EMEA and Asia increased approximately $15.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, during fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 and increased $50.2 million and $18.0 million, respectively, during fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003. Platform Information Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Windows 75 % 73 % 74 % Macintosh 25 % 27 % 26 % We expect a growth trend towards the Windows platform over the long term due to our targeting of business users with our Intelligent Document desktop products, where the majority of users run the Windows operating system. Inventory Information At the end of fiscal 2005 our overall channel inventory position was within our global inventory policy which allows, on an overall basis, up to 4.5 weeks of anticipated total product supply at our distributors. With regard to our product backlog, our experience is that the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. For example, prior to the finalization and release of new products, we may have significant levels of orders for new product releases. Our backlog of unfulfilled orders at the end of fiscal 2005, other than those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those due to the application of our global channel inventory policy, was approximately 8% of fourth quarter fiscal 2005 revenue. The comparable backlog at the end of third quarter of fiscal 2005 was approximately 2% of third quarter fiscal 2005 revenue. Cost of Revenues Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Product $ 90.0 4 % $ 86.6 8 % $ 79.9 Percentage of total revenues 5 % 5 % 6 % Services and support 22.6 27 % 17.8 36 % 13.1 Percentage of total revenues 1 % 1 % 1 % Total cost of revenues $ 112.6 8 % $ 104.4 12 % $ 93.0 Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Cost of product revenue increased 5% during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to material costs related to higher shrink wrap revenue, 3% due to an increase in our localization costs related to our 48 product launches, 2% related to royalties for licensed technologies, 1% related to excess and obsolete inventory and other expenses. These increases were partially offset by an 8% decrease in cost of product revenue due to a one time charge related to a litigation settlement that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The remaining 1% increase in cost of product revenue for fiscal 2005 was due to various individually insignificant items. Cost of product revenue increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to licensing costs as a result of litigation settlements that occurred in fiscal 2004 and an increase in localization costs related to our product launches. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in overall material costs. Services and Support Cost of services and support revenue is composed primarily of employee related costs and related costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to increases in headcount related expenses, including higher compensation and related benefits, as well as outsourced consulting fees. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to costs associated with our Expert Support program that was initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Additionally, cost of services and support revenue increased due to compensation and related benefits as a result of higher headcount and incentive compensation related to increases in services and support activities in fiscal 2004. Operating Expenses Research and Development Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Expenses $ 365.3 17 % $ 311.3 12 % $ 277.0 Percentage of total revenues 19 % 19 % 21 % Research and development expenses consist of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. Research and development expenses fluctuated due to the following: % Change 2005 to 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation 10 % 8 % Increased use of contractors 1 Increased purchases of equipment and software licenses 2 Various individually insignificant items 4 4 Total change 17 % 12 % We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our software products. 49 Sales and Marketing Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Expenses $ 593.3 14 % $ 521.1 23 % $ 423.4 Percentage of total revenues 30 % 31 % 33 % Sales and marketing expenses include salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, customer support, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses fluctuated due to the following: % Change 2005 to 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation 7 % 12 % Increased marketing spending related to product launches and overall marketing efforts to further increase revenues 4 9 Various individually insignificant items 3 2 Total change 14 % 23 % General and Administrative Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Expenses $ 166.7 21 % $ 138.0 13 % $ 122.4 Percentage of total revenues 8 % 8 % 9 % General and administrative expenses consist of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business. General and administrative expenses fluctuated due to the following: % Change 2005 to 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation 8 % 10 % Increased professional fees 6 3 Increased depreciation and amortization 3 Increased repairs and maintenance 2 Decreased legal fees (2 ) Various individually insignificant items 4 Total change 21 % 13 % 50  Restructuring and Other Charges Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Expenses $ % $ * % $ (0.5 ) Percentage of total revenues * % * Percentage is not meaningful. We did not incur any restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2005 and 2004. During fiscal 2003, we revised our estimates of certain costs associated with our restructuring program that was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, we revised the accrual related to severance and other charges and facilities. Non operating Income Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Investment gain (loss) $ (1.3 ) * % $ 2.5 * % $ (12.9 ) Percentage of total revenues * % * % (1 )% Interest and other income 38.6 * % 14.3 3 % 13.9 Percentage of total revenues 2 % 1 % 1 % Total non operating income $ 37.3 * % $ 16.8 * % $ 1.0 * Percentage is not meaningful. Investment Gain (Loss) Investment gain (loss) consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other than temporary declines in the value of marketable and non marketable equity securities, and gains and losses of Adobe Ventures. 2005 2004 2003 Net losses related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and cost method investments $ (1.0 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (12.0 ) Write downs due to other than temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities (0.6 ) (4.0 ) Gains from sale of short term investments 0.1 2.5 3.1 Gains on stock warrants 0.2 0.1 Total investment gain (loss) $ (1.3 ) $ 2.5 $ (12.9 ) We are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon market conditions and the operations of the underlying investee companies. Interest and Other Income The largest component of interest and other income is interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short term fixed income investments, but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments, foreign exchange transactions including hedging gains and losses, and interest expense. 51 Interest and other income increased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher levels of cash and higher interest rates during fiscal 2005, as well as higher gains on our foreign currency hedging program. Interest and other income increased in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to higher levels of cash during fiscal 2004. Income Tax Provision Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Provision $ 162.9 3 % $ 158.2 39 % $ 114.1 Percentage of total revenues 8 % 10 % 9 % Effective tax rate 21 % 26 % 30 % Our effective tax rate decreased 4 percentage points during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to a $29.3 million tax benefit recognized for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109 2 ("FAS 109 2"), "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 ("AJCA")." See Note 1 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding FAS 109 2. The net tax benefit includes a $72.8 million reversal for taxes on foreign earnings for which a deferred tax liability had been previously accrued. In addition, our effective tax rate decreased 1 percentage point due to a variety of factors, including higher profits earned by our international trading company which are taxed at a lower statutory rate and a reduction of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 due to higher profits earned by our international trading company which are taxed at a lower statutory rate.  EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR STOCK OPTIONS Option Program Description Our stock option program is a long term retention program that is intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for talented employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We consider our stock option program critical to our operation and productivity; essentially all of our employees participate. Option vesting periods are generally three years for all of the plans within our stock option program. For further information regarding our stock option program, see Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All stock option grants to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. All members of the Executive Compensation Committee are independent directors, as defined in the rules applicable to issuers traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market. See the "Report of the Executive Compensation Committee" appearing in our 2006 Proxy Statement for further information concerning the policies and procedures, of Adobe and the Executive Compensation Committee, regarding the use of stock options for executive officers. 52 Distribution and Dilutive Effect of Options The table below provides information about stock options granted for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 to our Chief Executive Officer and our four other most highly compensated executive officers. This group is referred to as the Named Executive Officers. Options granted to employees, directors and Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2003 through 2005 are summarized as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Net grants during the period as % of outstanding shares 2 % 4 % (3 )% Net grants to Named Executive Officers during the period as % of total options granted 12 % 9 % 0 % Net grants to Named Executive Officers during the period as % of outstanding shares * % * % 0 % Cumulative options held by Named Executive Officers as % of total options outstanding 15 % 16 % 16 % "Net grants" equals the sum of the number of shares subject to options granted to all employees, directors and Named Executive Officers during the specified period reduced by the number of shares subject to options which were canceled or otherwise terminated during such period. Net grants during fiscal 2004 reflect the new options granted in exchange for options cancelled under our stock option exchange program in fiscal 2003. Net grants during fiscal 2003 reflect the cancellation of options under our stock option exchange program. Net grants as a percentage of outstanding shares are based on 488.7 million shares, 484.4 million shares and 476.6 million shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 2, 2005, December 3, 2004 and November 28, 2003 respectively. *Less than 1%.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments $ 1,700.8 30 % $ 1,313.2 20 % $ 1,096.5 Working capital 1,528.2 38 % 1,107.1 24 % 892.5 Stockholders equity $ 1,864.3 31 % $ 1,423.5 29 % $ 1,100.8 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll (salaries, bonuses, and benefits), general operating expenses (marketing, travel, office rent) and cost of product revenue. Another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is detailed below. In fiscal 2005, we reclassified all auction rate securities and variable rate demand obligations to short term investments pursuant to an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95 ("SFAS 95"), "Statement of Cash Flows" relating to the definition of cash equivalents. This interpretation and subsequent reclassification has resulted in a presentation of our consolidated balance sheet that may understate the true liquidity of our fixed income portfolio. As of December 2, 2005, $158.2 million of the securities now classified as short term investments have structural features that allow us to sell the securities at par within 90 days and thus retain similar liquidity characteristics as cash equivalents. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2005, of $730.4 million, primarily comprised net income, net of non cash related expenses. Working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to compensation related costs and marketing expenses. Income taxes payable increased as a result of higher current tax liabilities related to repatriation of certain foreign earnings and overall increased taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Working capital uses of cash included increases in trade receivables and other current assets. Our accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue during the period. As compared to fiscal 2004, our days sales outstanding in trade receivables ("DSO") was 31 days, one day higher than fiscal 2004. Other current assets increased due to an increase in prepaid expenses primarily related to acquisition costs. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2004, of $683.7, million primarily comprised net income, net of non cash related expenses. Working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses, deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable. Accrued expenses increased primarily 55 due to compensation related costs. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Our accounts receivable decreased due to increased levels of cash collections. Our trade DSO decreased from 37 days at November 28, 2003 to 30 days at December 3, 2004. Working capital uses of cash included a decrease in income taxes payable due to tax payments made for both agreed and disputed tax assessments. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2003, of $433.1 million, primarily comprised net income, net of non cash related expenses, and increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to incentive compensation related costs, sales and marketing programs, legal fees and accruals for major product releases. Income taxes payable increased due to an increase in taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance obligations. These increases were partially offset by an increase in receivables at the end of the year and a decrease in accrued restructuring charges. The increase in receivables was primarily due to the increase in revenues during the year and the launch of our new Creative Suites and related CS products at the end of the year. The decrease in accrued restructuring is primarily due to the payments of severance and facility costs. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2005 of $320.4 million decreased from net cash used in fiscal 2004 of $330.3 million because there was not an investment in a lease receivable (related to our corporate headquarter office buildings) in 2005 as there was in 2004. This was partially offset by higher net purchases of short term investments in fiscal 2005. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2004 decreased from net cash used in fiscal 2003 of $577.8 million due primarily to lower net purchases of short term investments in fiscal 2004. Cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 of $246.6 million increased from cash used in fiscal 2004 of $224.5 million primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received from the re issuance of treasury stock as a result of a lower number of options being exercised. Cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2004 increased from the cash provided in fiscal 2003 of $117.0 million primarily due to repurchases of stock. Cash used for stock repurchases during fiscal 2004 increased from fiscal 2003 due to a higher average cost per share, a higher number of shares being repurchased and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements (see the section titled "Stock Repurchase Program I On Going Dilution"). We discontinued our quarterly cash dividend after the payment of the dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. We intend to use the cash previously used to pay the quarterly dividend for our ongoing stock repurchase programs. Under the terms of our lease agreements for our San Jose headquarters, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless an event of default occurs. We expect to continue our investing activities, including investments in short term and long term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Adobe uses professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 88% of Adobes invested balances during fiscal 2005. Within the U.S., the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds. Outside of the U.S., our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in U.S. Treasury notes and other sovereign obligations, and highly rated corporate notes. The balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes. All investments are made according to policies approved by the Board of Directors. During fiscal 2005, we completed our evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the AJCA and repatriated $558.3 million of certain foreign earnings. The effect of the repatriation was to increase liquidity in the United States with a corresponding reduction in liquidity in foreign subsidiaries. We expect 56 that our foreign subsidiaries will have sufficient positive cash flow from operations to meet ongoing liquidity needs over the next 12 months. Further information regarding the tax effects of the AJCA can be found in Note 8 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may decline during fiscal 2006 in the event of a weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in the section entitled "Business Risk Factors." Also, while we currently have no committed lines of credit, we believe that our banking relationships and good credit should afford us the opportunity to raise sufficient debt in the bank or public market, if required. Acquisition of Macromedia On December 3, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Macromedia, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, which was approved by the boards of directors and the stockholders of both companies, Macromedia stockholders received, at a fixed exchange ratio, 1.38 shares of Adobe common stock for every share of Macromedia common stock in a tax free exchange. This fixed exchange ratio gives effect to the two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend paid on May 23, 2005 to the stockholders of Adobe. We expect to incur significant incremental costs, such as direct costs related to the acquisition and costs associated with restructuring our operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet these cash outlays. Stock Repurchase Program I On going Dilution Coverage To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. Refer to Part II, Item 5(c) in this report for share repurchases during the quarter ended December 2, 2005. During fiscal 2005, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions. Under these agreements, we provided the financial institutions with up front payments totaling $600.0 million. The financial institutions agreed to deliver to us, at certain intervals during the contract term, a certain number of our shares based on the volume weighted average price during such intervals less a specified discount. Upon payment, the $600.0 million was classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet. As of December 2, 2005, approximately $154.9 million of the up front payments remained under the agreements which expired on December 22, 2005. On April 17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the use of $1.0 billion for stock repurchase commencing upon the close of the Macromedia acquisition. At the beginning of our fiscal 2006, we entered into additional structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions. Under these agreements, we provided the financial institutions with up front payments totaling $500.0 million. The financial institutions agreed to deliver to us, at certain intervals during the contract term, a certain number of shares based on the volume weighted average price during such intervals less a specified discount. The $500.0 million will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet. 57 Stock Repurchase Program II Additional Authorization above Dilution Coverage On September 25, 2002, our Board of Directors authorized a program to purchase up to an additional 10.0 million shares of our common stock over a three year period, subject to certain business and cash flow requirements. We have not made any purchases under this 10.0 million share repurchase program. The authorization for this program expired in September 2005.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of December 2, 2005, consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. We expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital. Lease Commitments The two lease agreements discussed in Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are subject to standard financial covenants. As of December 2, 2005 we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants. We expect to remain within compliance in the next 12 months. We are comfortable with these limitations and believe they will not impact our credit or cash in the coming year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. See Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our lease commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of December 2, 2005: Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years Over 5 years Non cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income $ 160.4 $ 29.9 $ 44.9 $ 27.2 $ 58.4 58 Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officers or directors lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnerships. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue and are not included in the table above. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost of products revenue on our consolidated statements of income, was approximately $17.8 million, $15.9 million and $14.5 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Certain royalty commitments have minimum commitment obligations, however, as of December 2, 2005 all such obligations were immaterial.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes. Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments We transact business in foreign countries, in U.S. dollars and in various foreign currencies. In Europe and Japan, transactions that are denominated in euro or yen subject us to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to yen denominated product and support revenue in Japan and euro denominated product and support revenue in certain European countries. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, our revenue exposures were 26.4 billion yen, 24.1 billion yen and 21.3 billion yen, respectively. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, our revenue exposures were 411.4 million euros, 375.4 million euros and 274.0 million euros, respectively. Our Japanese operating expenses are in yen and our European operating expenses are primarily in euro, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated product revenue. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is intended to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. At December 2, 2005, total outstanding contracts were $339.3 million which included the 59 notional equivalent of $133.0 million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and the notional equivalent of $206.3 million in put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue. As of December 2, 2005, all contracts were set to expire at various times through April 2006. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty. In addition we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non USD functional currency foreign subsidiaries. For the fiscal years ending December 2, 2005 and December 3, 2004 this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $56.7 million and $40.1 million, respectively. At this time we do not hedge these long term investment exposures. Economic Hedging Hedges of Forecasted Transactions We use option foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain operational ("cash flow") exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen and the euro. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business, and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income at that time. For the fiscal year ended December 2, 2005, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. See also Note 15 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Balance Sheet Hedging Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income (loss). These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At December 2, 2005, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 150 days or less. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 2, 2005. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% and 15% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For option contracts, the Black Scholes equation model was used. For forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% and 15% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $26.2 million and $39.9 million, respectively. Conversely, a 10% and 15% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $16.9 million and $22.1 million, respectively. 60  We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program. See also Note 15 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity Investments We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of December 2, 2005, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $1.8 million compared to $2.8 million at December 3, 2004, a decrease of 34%. The decrease was due to sales of $1.2 million and $0.6 million write downs due to an other than temporary decline in value of our marketable equity securities offset by an increase of $0.8 in market value adjustments. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could adversely change in the near term. We have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value. Our policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each companys cash position, earnings/revenue outlook, stock price performance over the past six months, liquidity and management/ownership. If we believe that an other than temporary decline in value exists in one of our marketable equity securities, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write down in our consolidated statements of income. The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of 50%, 35% and 15% were selected based on the probability of their occurrence. 50% 35% 15% Marketable equity securities $ (0.9 ) $ (0.6 ) $ (0.3 ) Fixed Income Investments At December 2, 2005, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities, including those classified as cash equivalents, of $1,657.3 million compared to $1,272.8 million at December 3, 2004, an increase of 30%. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments. The table below separates the remaining maturities of our fixed income securities into segments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates. A significant proportion of securities classified as "due after three years," based on the stated maturity, have structural features that allow us to sell the securities, at par, in less than three years. Due within one year $ 818.6 Due within two years 315.3 Due within three years 114.1 Due after three years 409.3 Total $ 1,657.3 61 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 2, 2005. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons. The following table represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis. 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 6 month horizon $ (3.7 ) $ (7.2 ) $ (10.9 ) 12 month horizon $ (1.3 ) $ (2.5 ) $ (3.8 ) We limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. Our investment policy limits the maximum weighted average duration of all invested funds to 2.5 years. The guidelines also establish credit quality standards, limits on exposure to any one security issue, limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument. Privately Held Investments We have direct investments, as well as indirect investments through Adobe Ventures, in several privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, and we could lose a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. It is our policy to review privately held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies. This policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies. See also Note 1 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 62
