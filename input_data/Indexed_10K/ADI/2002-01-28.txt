ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Net sales were $2,277 million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of 12% from net sales of $2,578 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease in net sales was attributable to declining demand in several markets that we serve, particularly the communications market, as well as an overall decline in the general economy. Fiscal 2001 analog IC product sales decreased 3% from fiscal 2000. Our analog IC product sales were strong in the first half of the year and declined in line with a major downturn in the semiconductor industry that occurred during the last half of fiscal 2001. Our fiscal 2001 DSP IC product sales decreased 32% from the prior year due to order cancellations and adjustments, particularly from telecommunications customers and contract manufacturers. Sales of new products, which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters, were 19% of net sales in fiscal 2001 as compared with 25% in fiscal 2000. The year over year decrease in new products as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the sharp downturn in sales of our communications products. Net sales were $2,578 million in fiscal 2000, an increase of 78% over net sales of $1,450 million in fiscal 1999. This increase in net sales was attributable to continued growth in the markets we serve. Sales into all end markets increased in fiscal 2000 with the communications market representing the largest growth area. The percentage of sales by geographic region for the last three years is as follows: Region Fiscal 2001 Fiscal 2000 Fiscal 1999 North America 39 % 45 % 46 % Europe 24 % 19 % 22 % Japan 15 % 14 % 14 % Southeast Asia 22 % 22 % 18 % As set forth above, the fiscal 2001 decline in North American sales as a percentage of total sales was principally attributable to an overall decline in the communications market as well as a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry. Sales to international regions remained strong in the first half of fiscal 2001 but weakened in the latter half of the year due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry. In absolute dollar terms, sales to Europe increased by 10% in fiscal 2001. Sales in fiscal 2001 to Japan remained relatively flat to fiscal 2000 as both a percentage of sales and in absolute dollar terms. Fiscal 2001 sales to Southeast Asia remained flat as a percentage of sales as compared to fiscal 2000 while declining approximately 13% in absolute dollars. In fiscal 2000, sales to Europe declined as a percentage of total sales largely due to a weakening Euro/ U.S. dollar exchange rate over fiscal 1999. In absolute dollars, fiscal 2000 net sales increased over fiscal 1999 by 72% in North America, 61% in Europe, 75% in Japan and 114% in Southeast Asia. These large sales increases were due to high growth in end market demand that was not sustainable. Gross margin was $1,269 million, or 55.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 compared to $1,461 million, or 56.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. Gross margin declined by 100 basis points from the prior year due to reduced revenue levels, the impact of inventory reserves and low utilization of our internal fabs. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2000 to 56.7% from the 49.3% achieved in fiscal 1999 was due primarily to the favorable effect of fixed costs being allocated across a higher sales base and improved manufacturing efficiencies as production increased at our wafer fabrication, assembly and test facilities. Gross margin declined to 52% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as a result of a 47% sales decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. Research and development (R&D) expense amounted to $465 million in fiscal 2001, an increase of $75 million over fiscal 2000. Additional expenses associated with increased engineering headcount were the main reason for the year over year increase. As a result of the decline in the year to year revenue, R&D spending as a percentage of sales increased to 20.4% from 15.1% in fiscal 2000. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product 13 Table of Contents leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. In fiscal 2000, R&D expense increased to $390 million from $253 million in fiscal 1999. Amortization of intangibles was $53 million for fiscal 2001 compared with $11 million for fiscal 2000. The increase in amortization expense was attributable to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of BCO Technologies plc in the third quarter of fiscal 2000, and the acquisition of Thomas Neuroth AG, Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd., Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc., ChipLogic, Inc. and Staccato Systems, Inc. completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the following acquisitions: Maximum Purchase Contingent Acquired Company Price Consideration Thomas Neuroth AG (Neuroth) $ 4,500,000 $ 4,000,000 Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd. (SPA) 3,800,000 500,000 Integrated Micro Instruments (IMI) 1,900,000 2,700,000 ChipLogic, Inc. (ChipLogic) 68,300,000 29,000,000 Staccato Systems, Inc. (Staccato) 23,800,000 7,000,000 On October 31, 2000, we acquired Thomas Neuroth AG (Neuroth) of Vienna, Austria for approximately $4.5 million in cash, with additional contingent cash consideration of up to $4 million payable if certain operational objectives are achieved. As of November 3, 2001, $1 million of the contingent consideration has been paid and charged to operations. The remaining $3 million of contingent consideration will be accounted for as goodwill. Neuroth is a developer of highly integrated circuits for symmetric DSL broadband access. On November 10, 2000, we acquired Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd., (SPA) of Victoria, Australia for approximately $3.8 million in cash, with additional contingent cash consideration of up to $0.5 million payable if certain operation objectives are achieved. The contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense. SPA is a developer and supplier of voice processing and fax/data relay software for telecommunications applications. On December 18, 2000, we acquired Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc. (IMI) of Berkeley, California for approximately $1.1 million in cash and 13,750 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $0.8 million. An additional 50,000 shares of common stock valued at a fixed amount of approximately $2.7 million are issuable over the next five years upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense. IMI develops MEMS process designs. On January 4, 2001, we acquired ChipLogic, Inc. (ChipLogic) of Santa Clara, California. The total purchase price of $68.3 million consisted of cash of approximately $4 million, approximately 1 million shares of our common stock valued at $60.2 million and the assumption of $4.1 million of outstanding ChipLogic stock options. Approximately $9.5 million represented the purchase price of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during fiscal 2001. An additional $8 million of cash consideration and 489,375 shares of common stock is due if certain operational objectives are achieved and will be accounted for as compensation expense. Of these shares, 249,375 contingent shares have a fixed value of approximately $13 million which is being charged to operations over a five year period. The remaining 240,000 shares are subject to performance based criteria. During fiscal 2001, approximately $4.2 million of expense was recorded related to the issuance of 117,592 shares of common stock associated with the achievement of certain of these objectives. The remaining performance based shares had a value of approximately $3.8 million as of November 3, 2001. To the extent that the remaining criteria are met, our stock price at that time will be used to measure the amount of compensation expense to be recoded. ChipLogic is a developer of high performance integrated circuits and software focused on the convergence of voice, broadband access and network protocol processing. 14 Table of Contents On January 16, 2001, we acquired Staccato Systems, Inc. (Staccato) of Mountain View, California. The total purchase price of $23.8 million consisted of $23 million in cash and the assumption of $0.8 million of outstanding Staccato stock options. Additional contingent cash consideration of up to $7 million is payable if certain operational objectives are achieved and will be accounted for as additional goodwill. Approximately $1.8 million of the contingent consideration has been paid as of November 3, 2001. Staccato is in the field of audio synthesis technology. During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we acquired BCO Technologies plc (BCO), a company with operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in a cash for stock transaction valued at approximately $163 million. BCO is a leading supplier of silicon on insulator wafers used for fabricating micromechanical optical devices for optical switching and communications applications. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded approximately $158 million of goodwill. There was no in process research and development write off related to this acquisition. During the second quarter of fiscal 1999, we acquired two DSP tools companies, White Mountain DSP, Inc. of Nashua, New Hampshire (WM) and Edinburgh Portable Compilers Limited, of Edinburgh, Scotland (EPC). The total cost of these acquisitions was approximately $23 million with additional cash consideration of up to a maximum of $10 million payable if the acquired companies achieve certain revenue and operational objectives. As of November 3, 2001 all of the additional cash consideration has been paid and accounted for as additional purchase price. In connection with the acquisitions of WM and EPC, we recorded a charge of $5.1 million for the write off of in process research and development. Selling, marketing, general and administrative (SMG&A) expenses were $287 million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $6 million from the $293 million in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A increased to 12.6% for fiscal 2001 from 11.4% in fiscal 2000 as a result of reduced revenue levels. In fiscal 2000, SMG&A expenses increased $83 million from $210 million in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A decreased to 11.4% in fiscal 2000 from 14.5% in fiscal 1999 as a result of increased sales. During fiscal 2001, we recorded a special charge of approximately $47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the current economic climate. The actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing, which included a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities. Workforce reductions also occurred, to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas. As of November 3, 2001, the cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of approximately $30 million for approximately 1,200 employees in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Philippines, of which approximately half of these employees were terminated as of November 3, 2001. The special charge also included approximately $12 million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations. We believe that the workforce reductions will result in annual salary savings of approximately $40 million with a $27 million reduction in cost of sales and a $13 million reduction in operating expenses. The impact in fiscal 2002 of these cost savings is expected to be approximately $30 million, with a $20 million reduction in cost of sales and a $10 million reduction in operating expenses. Our operating income was $408 million, or 17.9% of sales, for fiscal 2001, compared to $767 million, or 29.8% of sales, in fiscal 2000 and $243 million, or 16.7% of net sales, for fiscal 1999. In fiscal 1999, we sold 78% of our investment in WaferTech, LLC (WaferTech) to other WaferTech partners in exchange for $105 million in cash, which was equal to 78% of the carrying value of the equity ownership at October 31, 1998. During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the sale of our remaining investment in WaferTech to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for approximately $61 million in cash. We recorded a pretax realized gain on the sale of this investment of approximately $28 million. In the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we sold our investment in Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte. Ltd. We received proceeds of approximately $65 million in cash and realized a pretax gain of approximately $44 million. These realized gains are included in other nonoperating income. Interest expense was $62 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $6 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest expense was the result of a full year of interest expense on our $1,200 million of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, which were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. Interest income was $133 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $63 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest income was due to higher cash 15 Table of Contents balances from increased cash flow as well as the unused portion of the funds obtained from the issuance of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes. Our effective income tax rate remained relatively flat at 29.7% for fiscal 2001 as compared to 29.9% for fiscal 2000, primarily due to a shift in the mix of worldwide profits offset by a taxable gain on the sale of our remaining WaferTech investment. Our effective income tax rate increased to 29.9% for fiscal 2000 from 23.6% in fiscal 1999 due to increased profits in higher tax jurisdictions, principally the United States. Fiscal 2001 net income was $356 million, or 15.7% of sales, and diluted earnings per share was $0.93 compared to net income in fiscal 2000 of $607 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.59. The fiscal 2001 decrease in net income from fiscal 2000 was primarily due to reduced revenue levels. Net income increased to $607 million, or 23.6% of sales, in fiscal 2000 from $197 million, or 13.6% of sales, in fiscal 1999. Effective October 29, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, (FAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. FAS 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure such instruments at fair market value. Under certain circumstances, a portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) until the hedged transaction affects earnings. For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in income immediately. While the adoption of FAS 133 on October 29, 2000 did not have a material impact on operations, it resulted in a $5 million loss recognized in OCI, which was reclassified into earnings during fiscal 2001. In August 2001 the Company adopted Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, (SAB 101), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 101 summarizes the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, (FAS 141), Business Combinations and No. 142, (FAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under FAS 142, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the Statement. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. We must adopt these new pronouncements no later than November 2002, with earlier adoption permitted. Application of the non amortization provisions of FAS 142 is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately $54 million, beginning in fiscal 2003. We will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and have not yet determined what effect, if any, the adoption of FAS 141 and 142 will have on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, (FAS 143), Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It also applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or) the normal operation of a long lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. We are required to adopt FAS 143 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we do not believe that the adoption of FAS 143 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, (FAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets. This statement supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and the accounting and reporting provisions for 16 Table of Contents the disposal of a segment of a business of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. We are required to adopt FAS 144 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we have not yet determined what effect, if any, the adoption of FAS 144 will have on our financial position or results of operations. The impact of inflation on our business during the past three years has not been significant. Liquidity and Capital Resources At November 3, 2001, we had $2,793 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments compared to $2,235 million at October 28, 2000. The $558 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to operating cash inflows of $844 million (37% of fiscal 2001 sales) offset by $297 million of capital spending. In fiscal 2000, our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased by $1,473 million primarily due to operating cash inflows of $705 million, or 27% of sales in fiscal 2000, and $1,172 million of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt offset by $275 million of capital spending and $169 million of acquisition related spending. Investing activities used $1,220 million in fiscal 2001 and $456 million in fiscal 2000, while financing activities generated $2 million in fiscal 2001 and $1,130 million in fiscal 2000. Accounts receivable of $218 million at the end of fiscal 2001 decreased $246 million or 53% from $464 million at the end of fiscal 2000. This decrease resulted principally from a $382 million decrease in sales from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Days sales outstanding improved from 52 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 to 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. As a percentage of annualized fourth quarter sales, accounts receivable was 12.9% at the end of fiscal 2001, down from 14.4% at the end of fiscal 2000. Inventories decreased $85 million, or 26%, from fiscal 2000 to $247 million at the end of fiscal 2001. Days cost of sales in inventory increased by 21 days to 111 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The decrease in inventory in absolute dollar terms is attributable to production decreases in response to reduced demand for our products as well as an increase in inventory reserves and a sharp curtailment of spending on wafers supplied by external foundries. We employ a variety of consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments by us about future demand for our inventory. Although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If actual demand for products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be reflected in future periods. Net additions to property, plant and equipment of $297 million for fiscal 2001 were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. Capital spending in fiscal 2001 increased slightly from the $275 million incurred in fiscal 2000. Significant fiscal 2001 capital additions included new facilities in Wilmington, MA; Sunnyvale, CA; and Limerick, Ireland. We currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $70 million in fiscal 2002. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to $171 million in fiscal 2002 from $158 million in fiscal 2001. We acquired five companies during fiscal 2001, as more fully described in Results of Operations. Total cash used to purchase these companies was approximately $38 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we issued $1,200 million of 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005 (2005 Notes), with semiannual interest payments on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing April 1, 2001. The 2005 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into our common stock at any time unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at a conversion price of $129.78 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. The net proceeds of the offering were $1,172 million after payment of 17 Table of Contents the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering, which will be amortized over the term of the 2005 Notes. After the issuance of the 2005 Notes, our debt to equity ratio increased to 53%. At November 3, 2001, our principal sources of liquidity were $2,793 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with current and anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for the foreseeable future. Forward Looking Statements The Management Analysis and other sections of this report contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate, managements beliefs and assumptions made by management. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on our behalf. Words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. (See Factors That May Affect Future Results below.) Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our largest customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times, including the recent decline in demand experienced during fiscal 2001. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets. Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less well established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. 18 Table of Contents We may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future. The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive. Some of our competitors have greater technical, marketing, manufacturing and financial resources than we do. Our competitors also include emerging companies attempting to sell products to specialized markets that we serve. Our competitors have, in some cases, developed and marketed products having similar design and functionality as our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. We may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained or short term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. We and the semiconductor industry experienced a period of rapid decreases in demand in fiscal 2001. As a result we have overcapacity due to the expansion of our production facilities and increased access to third party foundries. However, we cannot be sure that we will not encounter unanticipated production problems at either our own facilities or at third party foundries, or that our capacity will be sufficient to satisfy demand for our products. We believe that other semiconductor manufacturers have expanded their production capacity over the past several years. This expansion by us and our competitors and the continuation of the decline in the demand for semiconductor products that began in early fiscal 2001, has led to overcapacity in our target markets, which has resulted in a year over year decline in our revenue rate and could lead to price erosion that would adversely affect our operating results. We rely on third party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry standard wafers and assembly/test services and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test subcontractors and on third party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry standard digital processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity. Our capacity additions resulted in a significant increase in operating expenses. If revenue levels do not increase enough to offset these additional expense levels, our future operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time. We rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and services. We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in California and Taiwan as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment, and availability of key services including transport. In addition, California has recently experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has been negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for us, without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions. We are exposed to economic, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. During fiscal 2001, 61% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and Taiwan. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the 19 Table of Contents U.S. economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the response to them of the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates, tax and tariff rates and freight rates, and social and political unrest. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. We are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. We have from time to time received, and may in the future receive, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim and a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation can be costly and divert the attention of key personnel. See Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2001 for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. Leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. We may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on, and other amounts due in respect of, this indebtedness when due. Our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences. This substantial leverage could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. It may require the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures. It may also limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We have fixed rate debt obligations and interest rate swap and cap agreements. An increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations. Because of the size and structure of these obligations, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a material change in our interest expense or the fair value of the debt obligations and related interest rate swap and cap agreements for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. The fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio. The related interest income would change by approximately $6 million for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates for fiscal 2001 on a weighted average portfolio maturity of 93 days. The impact of a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on interest income was not material for fiscal 2000 due mainly to the relative insignificance of interest income to the consolidated pretax income. As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from three months up to one year. The short term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at November 3, 2001 and October 28, 2000. Currently, our largest foreign currency 20 Table of Contents exposure is against the Euro, primarily because Europe has a higher proportion of local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 3, 2001 and October 28, 2000, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 21 Table of Contents
