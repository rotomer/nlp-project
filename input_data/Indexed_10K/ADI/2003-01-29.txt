ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Fiscal Year 2002 Overview Fiscal 2002 was a challenging year for us. We recorded quarterly revenues of $806 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, which represented the peak of the current cycle. Our revenues then declined significantly to $393 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. We then experienced a gradual sequential recovery for the last three quarters of fiscal 2002, with our fiscal 2002 fourth quarter revenue reaching $456 million. Our gross margins remained strong at 53% for fiscal 2002. Operating expenses declined by almost 9% as a result of cost containment measures throughout our company. Our cash flow continued to be strong, with cash increasing by over $100 million during fiscal 2002 to $2,900 million after purchasing approximately $100 million of our common stock. Sales Net sales were $1,708 million in fiscal 2002, a decrease of 25% from net sales of $2,277 million in fiscal 2001. Approximately 80% of our net sales in both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were from analog products, which decreased 26% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and decreased 4% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001. DSP product sales represented the remaining 20% of our net sales in both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 and decreased 22% in fiscal 2002 after declining 33% in fiscal 2001. The decreases in net sales in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were attributable to declining demand in several markets that we serve, particularly the communications market, as well as an overall decline in the general economy. Sales of new products, which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters, were 21% of net sales in fiscal 2002 as compared to 19% in fiscal 2001. The year over year increase in new products as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the introduction of record numbers of new analog IC products throughout the economic downturn experienced over the past two years. Net sales were $2,277 million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of 12% from net sales of $2,578 million in fiscal 2000. This decrease in net sales was attributable to declining demand in the markets we serve, particularly the communications market, as well as an overall decline in the general economy. Sales of new products were 19% of net sales in fiscal 2001 as compared to 25% in fiscal 2000. The year over year decrease in new products as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the sharp downturn in sales of our communications products. The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Region Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2001 Fiscal 2000 North America 30 % 39 % 45 % Europe 21 % 24 % 19 % Japan 17 % 15 % 14 % Southeast Asia 32 % 22 % 22 % The fiscal 2002 decline in North American sales as a percentage of total net sales was principally attributable to an overall decline in the communications market, a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry as well as the ongoing transfer of customer manufacturing activity to lower cost locations, primarily Southeast Asia. Sales in fiscal 2002 to Japan increased slightly from fiscal 2001 as a percentage of net sales but declined by 15% in dollars. Fiscal 2002 sales to Southeast Asia increased as a percentage of net sales by 10% as compared to fiscal 2001 while increasing approximately 9% in dollars. In dollars, fiscal 2001 net sales decreased over fiscal 2000 by 23% in North America, 3% in Japan and 13% in Southeast Asia and increased over fiscal 2000 by 10% in Europe. 15 Table of Contents Gross Margin Fiscal 2002 gross margin was $905 million, or 53% of net sales, down 270 basis points from fiscal 2001 gross margin of $1,269 million, or 55.7% of net sales. Gross margin decreased to 55.7% in fiscal 2001 from the 56.7% achieved in fiscal 2000. The decline in year over year gross margin for both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was primarily due to reduced revenue levels and lower utilization of our internal wafer fabrication facilities. Gross margin increased to 53.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 from 51.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The gross margin improvement through fiscal 2002 was caused by a steady quarterly sales increase from the second quarter of fiscal 2002, combined with tight spending controls and the impact of manufacturing restructuring actions. We decided that we had the opportunity to use this downturn to fundamentally and permanently reduce our manufacturing infrastructure costs worldwide. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we announced that we would transition products from our older four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six inch and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities that were then operating well below capacity. As a result, the remaining service lives of certain assets within our wafer fabrication facilities were shortened. Depreciation expense included in cost of sales included additional depreciation of approximately $8.7 million in fiscal 2002 associated with the shortened lives of some equipment in our older four inch wafer fabrication facilities. Research and Development Research and development, or R&D, expenses amounted to $424 million in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $41 million from the $465 million recorded in fiscal 2001. Included in fiscal 2002 expense is approximately $13.8 million of acquisition related expenses compared to approximately $8.2 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in acquisition related expense in fiscal 2002 was attributable to a full year of expense related to fixed value contingent compensation and the achievement of final performance based criteria. R&D spending in dollars declined by 9% in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. The decline in R&D expenses in dollars was primarily due to the elimination of bonuses and the temporary reduction of salaries of our most highly compensated employees partially offset by selective hiring of engineers. As a result of the decline in year over year revenue, R&D spending as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2002 increased to 24.8% in fiscal 2002 from 20.4% in fiscal 2001. Despite the significant decline in sales in fiscal 2002, in view of our long term business strategy, we continued to invest in R&D at levels commensurate with significantly higher revenue levels than we were achieving in the short term. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. In fiscal 2001, R&D expense increased to $465 million from $390 million in fiscal 2000 as a result of additional expenses associated with increased engineering headcount. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative Selling, marketing, general and administrative, or SMG&A, expenses were $257 million in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $30 million, or 10.5%, from the $287 million recorded in fiscal 2001. The decrease in SMG&A expenses in dollars was the result of cost reduction programs including the elimination of bonuses and temporary salary reductions for our most highly compensated employees along with continued tight control over discretionary expenses. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A increased to 15% for fiscal 2002 from 12.6% in fiscal 2001 as a result of reduced revenue levels in fiscal 2002. The industry downturn offered us the opportunity to hire experienced, technically savvy personnel, many of whom were already familiar with our products and, as a result, we significantly increased our field application engineers during fiscal 2002. Despite the decline in net sales, we decided to significantly increase our field applications engineers in order to help our customers design in our newest products. In fiscal 2001, SMG&A expenses decreased by $6 million to $287 million from $293 million in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A increased to 12.6% in fiscal 2001 from 11.4% in fiscal 2000 as a result of reduced revenue levels. 16 Table of Contents Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $57 million for fiscal 2002 compared with $53 million for fiscal 2001 and $11 million in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2003, we anticipate amortization expense to decrease to approximately $3 million as a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal 2001 where amortization commenced during fiscal 2001. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was attributable to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of BCO Technologies plc. in the third quarter of fiscal 2000, and the acquisitions of Thomas Neuroth AG, Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd., Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc., ChipLogic, Inc. and Staccato Systems, Inc. completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Special Charges During fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges totaling $48.5 million and, during fiscal 2001, we recorded special charges of $47 million. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $27.2 million. The second quarter charge included $25.7 million related to the planned transfer of production from our three older four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our three six inch and one eight inch wafer fabrication facilities, and $3 million primarily related to the impairment of an investment, which was offset by a $1.5 million adjustment to estimated equipment cancellation fees recorded in fiscal year 2001. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. Included in the $25.7 million component of the special charge are severance and fringe benefit costs of $15.3 million for 509 manufacturing employees in the United States and Ireland, of which 182 of these employees had been terminated as of November 2, 2002, $2.3 million related to the write down of equipment to be abandoned and $8.1 million of other charges primarily related to lease termination and cleanup costs. In addition, the remaining service lives of certain assets within the older four inch wafer fabrication facilities have been shortened. Depreciation expense included in cost of sales in fiscal 2002 included additional depreciation of approximately $8.7 million associated with the shortened lives of these assets. The write down of equipment was principally due to our decision to discontinue various product development strategies. As of November 2, 2002, there was $25 million related to these charges remaining to be paid. This program is proceeding in accordance with our original plan and we expect to substantially complete these actions by mid fiscal 2003. Once fully complete, we anticipate annual savings from the above actions of approximately $60 million, primarily in cost of sales, and the first full years impact will be fiscal 2004. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of $12.8 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $3.7 million related to cost reduction actions taken in several product groups and, to a lesser extent, in manufacturing, $3.8 million related to the impairment of an investment, $3.4 million impairment of goodwill related to the closure of an Austrian design center we acquired in fiscal 2001 and $1.9 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancellation fees. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. The severance and fringe benefit costs were for approximately 70 engineering employees in the United States, Europe and Canada, and approximately 30 manufacturing employees in the United States. All of the manufacturing employees and approximately 32 of the engineering employees had been terminated as of November 2, 2002. As of November 2, 2002, there was $4.3 million related to these charges remaining to be paid. We expect to substantially complete these actions in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Once fully complete, we anticipate the workforce reductions will result in annual savings of approximately $10 million, primarily in operating expenses. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of $8.4 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $2.5 million related to cost reduction actions taken in our sales 17 Table of Contents group, several product groups and in manufacturing for approximately 65 employees in the United States and Europe, of which 40 had been terminated as of November 2, 2002. The charges also included $2.1 million related to the impairment of investments, $1.8 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancellation fees and a change in estimate of $2 million related to previously recorded cleanup costs. The investment impairment charges were related to the decline in fair value of a publicly traded equity investment below cost basis that was determined to be other than temporary and of an equity investment in a private company. The private company equity investment was part of a product strategy we decided to abandon. As of November 2, 2002, there was $3.1 million related to these charges remaining to be paid. We expect to substantially complete these actions by the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Once fully complete, we anticipate the workforce reductions will result in annual savings of approximately $4 million, primarily in operating expenses. The restructuring actions underlying the special charges accrued in fiscal 2002 are proceeding as planned. The cost savings impact in fiscal 2002 of the special charges related to severance and benefits was approximately $2 million. Most of the remaining accrued special charge is attributable to actions planned and accrued in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 that involved the transfer of production from three separate four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six inch and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities, which are located in Massachusetts, California and Ireland. Our plan is for this transfer to be completed by mid fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2001, we recorded special charges of $47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the then current economic climate. The actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas. In addition, we made a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities. The cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of $29.6 million for approximately 1,200 employees in the United States, Europe, Asia and the Philippines, of which approximately 1,010 of these employees had been terminated as of November 2, 2002. The remaining 190 employees are expected to be terminated during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. As of November 2, 2002, $23 million of the $29.6 million aggregate severance cost obligations underlying the fiscal 2001 worldwide cost reduction actions had been paid. The special charge also included $11.6 million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations and $5.8 million of other charges primarily related to equipment and lease cancellation fees. Based on the results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order cancellation fees, the amount paid was approximately $1.5 million less than the amount recorded for such charges and accordingly, in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we adjusted the provision for purchase order cancellation fees by $1.5 million to reflect this change in estimate. As of November 2, 2002, there was $7.6 million related to these charges remaining to be paid. We believe that the workforce reductions will result in annual salary savings of approximately $40 million, consisting of a $27 million reduction in cost of sales and a $13 million reduction in operating expenses. The impact in fiscal 2002 of these cost savings was approximately $30 million, consisting of a $20 million reduction in cost of sales and a $10 million reduction in operating expenses. The restructuring actions included in the special charges recorded during fiscal 2001 are proceeding as planned. Of the $47 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2001, $7.6 million remained accrued as of November 2, 2002. The amount covers termination payments being paid as income continuance to 1,010 terminated employees as a result of the fiscal 2001 actions as well as accrued termination payments for the remaining 190 employees expected to be terminated in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Operating Income Our operating income was $118 million, or 6.9% of sales, in fiscal 2002, compared to $408 million, or 17.9% of sales, in fiscal 2001 and $767 million, or 29.8% of net sales, for fiscal 2000. Nonoperating Income and Expense Interest expense was $44 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $62 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in interest expense was the result of an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in January 2002 that has the effect of swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of our $1,200 million convertible subordinated notes into a LIBOR 18 Table of Contents based floating rate (1.61% as of November 6, 2002). Interest expense was $62 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $6 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest expense was the result of a full year of interest expense on our $1,200 million of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, which were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. Interest income was $65 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $133 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in interest income was attributable to less income earned on our invested cash balances due to the decline in interest rates during fiscal 2002 as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and our decision to increase our holdings of higher credit quality yet lower interest bearing investments. Interest income was $133 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $63 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest income was due to higher cash balances from increased cash flow as well as the unused portion of the funds obtained from the issuance of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes. Other income decreased approximately $28 million in fiscal 2002 from fiscal 2001 due to a one time gain on the sale of our investment in WaferTech recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Other income decreased approximately $12 million in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 primarily due to a one time gain of $44 million on the sale of our investment in Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte. Ltd. recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2000, offset by the sale of WaferTech described above. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate decreased to 25.0% for fiscal 2002 as compared to 29.7% for fiscal 2001 due to a shift in the mix of worldwide profits. Our effective income tax rate remained relatively flat at 29.7% for fiscal 2001 as compared to 29.9% for fiscal 2000. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2003 is expected to be approximately 22.0%. The expected decrease is the result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of our adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Net Income Fiscal 2002 net income was $105 million, or 6.2% of sales, and diluted earnings per share was $0.28 compared to net income in fiscal 2001 of $356 million, or 15.7% of sales, and diluted earnings per share of $0.93. The fiscal 2002 decrease in net income from fiscal 2001 was primarily due to reduced revenue levels. Net income decreased to $356 million in fiscal 2001 from $607 million, or 23.6% of sales, in fiscal 2000. The impact of inflation on our business during the past three years has not been significant. Acquisitions During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the following acquisitions: In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the acquisitions of Thomas Neuroth AG, Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd. and Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc. The total amount paid for these acquisitions, as of November 2, 2002, was $10.2 million. As of November 2, 2002, the remaining contingent consideration of $2.7 million will be paid if certain operational objectives are met and will be accounted for as compensation expense. On January 4, 2001, we acquired ChipLogic, Inc. of Santa Clara, California. ChipLogic is a developer of high performance integrated circuits and software focused on the convergence of voice, broadband access and network protocol processing. The total purchase price of $68.3 million consisted of approximately $4 million in cash, approximately 1 million shares of our common stock valued at $60.2 million and the assumption of $4.1 million of outstanding ChipLogic vested stock options. Approximately $9.5 million represented the purchase price of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during fiscal 2001. An additional $8 million of cash consideration and 489,375 shares of common stock is due if certain operational objectives are achieved and will, if paid, be accounted for as compensation expense. Of these shares, 249,375 contingent shares have a fixed value of approximately $13 million and are being charged to operations over a five year period as 19 Table of Contents their restrictions lapse. The remaining 240,000 shares are subject to performance based criteria and during fiscal 2001, approximately $4.2 million of expense was recorded related to the issuance of 117,592 shares of common stock associated with the achievement of certain of these objectives. During fiscal 2002, approximately $5 million was recorded related to the issuance of the remaining shares. As of November 2, 2002, there was $8 million of remaining contingent consideration. We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million of this contingent consideration in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. An additional $2.8 million of compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal 2005 related to our assumption of unvested stock options. On January 16, 2001, we acquired Staccato Systems, Inc. of Mountain View, California. Staccato is in the field of audio synthesis technology. The total purchase price of $23.8 million consisted of $23 million in cash and the assumption of $0.8 million of outstanding Staccato vested stock options. We paid an additional $7 million related to the achievement of operational objectives that was accounted for as additional goodwill, of which approximately $5 million was recorded in fiscal 2002. All of the contingent consideration had been paid as of November 2, 2002. An additional $0.2 million of compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal 2005 related to the assumption of unvested stock options. During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we acquired BCO Technologies plc, or BCO, a company with operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in a cash for stock transaction valued at approximately $163 million. BCO is a leading supplier of silicon on insulator, or SOI, wafers used for fabricating micromechanical devices. As a result of our acquisition of BCO, we are incorporating SOI technology into our next generation of inertial sensors. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded approximately $158 million of goodwill. There was no in process research and development write off related to this acquisition. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, or FAS 141, Business Combinations and No. 142, or FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under FAS 142, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. As of November 2002, we have adopted these new pronouncements. Application of the non amortization provisions of FAS 142 is expected to result in an increase in annual net income of approximately $54 million, beginning in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003, we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill as of November 3, 2002. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, or FAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or) the normal operation of a long lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. We are required to adopt FAS 143 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and do not believe that the adoption of FAS 143 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, or FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets. This statement supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of a business set forth in APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. We are required to adopt FAS 144 in the first quarter of 20 Table of Contents fiscal 2003 and do not believe that the adoption of FAS 144 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, or FAS 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. Under FAS 145, gains and losses on extinguishments of debt are to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than extraordinary items. We are required to adopt FAS 145 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, or FAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Costs covered by the statement include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. FAS 146 may affect the timing of our recognition of future exit or disposal costs, if any. Liquidity and Capital Resources At November 2, 2002, we had $2,898 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments compared to $2,793 million at November 3, 2001. The $105 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to operating cash inflows of $226 million, or 13% of sales in fiscal 2002, and $37 million of proceeds from employee stock plans, offset by a $98 million repurchase of shares of our common stock and $57 million of capital spending. In fiscal 2001, our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased by $558 million to $2,793 million from $2,235 million in fiscal 2000 primarily due to operating cash inflows of $844 million, or 37% of sales in fiscal 2001, offset by $297 million of capital spending. Investing activities provided $90 million in fiscal 2002 and used $1,220 million in fiscal 2001, while financing activities used $69 million in fiscal 2002 and provided $2 million in fiscal 2001. Accounts receivable of $228 million at the end of fiscal 2002 increased $10 million, or 4.7%, from $218 million at the end of fiscal 2001. This increase resulted principally from a $32 million increase in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Days sales outstanding remained at 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. As a percentage of annualized fourth quarter sales, accounts receivable was 12.5% at the end of fiscal 2002, down from 12.9% at the end of fiscal 2001. Inventories increased $60 million, or 24%, from the end of fiscal 2001 to $306 million at the end of fiscal 2002. Days cost of sales in inventory increased by 24 days to 135 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The increase in inventory in dollars was attributable to the combination of internal die bank builds and external wafer purchases. The build in die bank inventory was in preparation for the transfer of production from our four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities. The external wafer purchases were in support of expected demand in our handset and consumer analog business. We are nearing the completion of the die bank build and have cut back on external wafer purchases. Therefore, we expect that inventory will remain relatively flat in dollars during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and our days cost of sales in inventory will start to decline towards our long term model of 100 to 110 days during fiscal 2003. Net additions to property, plant and equipment of $57 million in fiscal 2002 were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. Capital spending in fiscal 2002 was down substantially from the $297 million incurred in fiscal 2001. In response to the slowdown in our served markets, we have substantially reduced our capital spending. We currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $80 million in fiscal 2003. Capital expenditures are expected to remain low, as we believe we currently have ample installed capacity to significantly increase internal production levels. Depreciation expense is expected to decrease slightly in fiscal 2003 from $181 million in fiscal 2002. 21 Table of Contents We acquired five companies during fiscal 2001, as more fully described in Acquisitions. Total cash used to purchase these companies was approximately $38.5 million in 2001 and another $5.2 million was paid in fiscal 2002 as certain operational objectives were achieved, and these additional payments were accounted for as additional goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we issued $1,200 million of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2005, or 2005 notes, with semiannual interest payments on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2005 notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of our common stock at any time unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at a conversion price of $129.78 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. The net proceeds of the offering were $1,172 million after payment of the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering, which are being amortized over the term of the 2005 notes. The table below summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of November 2, 2002: (thousands) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007+ Total Contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 7,773 $ 9,173 $ 1,210,498 $ $ $ 1,227,444 Capital lease obligations 3,828 467 4,295 Operating leases 15,793 13,358 11,889 8,522 11,421 60,983 Total $ 27,394 $ 22,998 $ 1,222,387 $ 8,522 $ 11,421 $ 1,292,722 At November 2, 2002, our principal source of liquidity was $2,898 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with current and anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments by us about future demand for our inventory. Additionally, we have built inventory in preparation for the transfer of production from our four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities for both lifetime supply and transition inventory. We have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds. Although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If actual demand for products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. 22 Table of Contents Long Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we will adopt the new rules of FAS 142 for measuring the impairment of goodwill, which prescribe a fair value based approach. The estimates and assumptions described above along with other factors such as discount rates will affect the amount of an impairment loss, if any, we recognize under FAS 142. Upon adoption of FAS 142, we will be required to make a transition test of our goodwill for impairment, which may result in a significant transition impairment loss. Any transition impairment loss will be recorded as a change in accounting principle. At least annually thereafter, we will be required to test goodwill for impairment, which may result in additional impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. FAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. At November 2, 2002, we had deferred tax assets of $159 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. While these assets are not assured of realization, we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization and concluded that no significant valuation allowance is required. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In addition, we have provided for potential liabilities due in various foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. 23 Table of Contents Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, or FAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated. Should a loss be probable and estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with FAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Stock Options We have voluntarily provided the following disclosure in order to provide our stockholders with a single source for information about our stock options. We believe that this disclosure, combined with the disclosure provided in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in our 2003 proxy statement, provides detailed information about our stock option programs. Option Program Description Our stock option program is a broad based, long term employee retention program that is intended to attract, retain and motivate our employees, officers and directors and to align their interests with those of our stockholders. We have two plans under which we currently grant stock options: 1) The 1998 Stock Option Plan, as amended, under which officers, directors and employees of Analog are granted options to purchase shares of our common stock; and 2) The 2001 Broad Based Stock Option Plan, as amended, under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to all employees, consultants and advisors of Analog, other than officers or directors. Substantially all of our employees participate in these plans. Option vesting periods are generally five years for our grants and all options have a term of ten years. Our option plans do not permit us to grant options at exercise prices that are below the fair market value of our common stock as of the date of grant. These plans are critical to our efforts to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the extremely competitive semiconductor industry. Options are generally granted once per year between September and January as part of our annual performance appraisal process. Occasionally, as in fiscal year 2002, two sets of option grants can fall within one fiscal year, as the process spans the end of one fiscal year and the beginning of the next fiscal year. Conversely, as in fiscal year 1999, there are fiscal years in which no annual merit options are granted. We have a goal to keep the dilution related to our option program to a long term average of approximately 4% annually. The dilution percentage is calculated as the total number of shares of our common stock underlying new option grants for the year, net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by total outstanding shares of our common stock. All stock option grants to executive officers and directors can be made only from stockholder approved plans and are made after a review by, and with the approval of the compensation committee of our board of directors. All members of the compensation committee are independent directors, as that term is defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the New York Stock Exchange. See the Report of the Compensation Committee in our 2003 proxy statement for further information regarding the policies and procedures of Analog and the compensation committee regarding our grant of stock options. 24 Table of Contents In December 2002, our Board of Directors adopted an amendment to each of our 2001 Broad Based Stock Option Plan and our 1998 Stock Option Plan to provide that the terms of outstanding options under these plans may not be amended to provide an option exercise price per share which is lower than the original option exercise price per share.

Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains or incorporates forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and managements beliefs and assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on our behalf. Words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading Factors That May Affect Future Results that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make. We do not intend to update publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 27 Table of Contents Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our largest customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times, including the decline in demand experienced since early in fiscal year 2001. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Long term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. In certain markets where end user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our backlog. As a result, we are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp fall off of sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet the customers unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets. Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. We may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future. Many other companies offer products that compete with our products. Some also offer other electronic products, and some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. 28 Table of Contents We may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained or short term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. We, and the semiconductor industry, experienced a period of rapid decreases in demand that began early in fiscal 2001. As a result, we have overcapacity due to the expansion of our production facilities and increased access to third party foundries. However, we cannot be sure that we will not encounter unanticipated production problems at either our own facilities or at third party foundries, or that our capacity will be sufficient to satisfy demand for our products. We believe that other semiconductor manufacturers have expanded their production capacity over the past several years. This expansion by us and our competitors, and the continuation of the decline in the demand for semiconductor products that began early in fiscal 2001, has led to overcapacity in our target markets, which has resulted in a year over year decline in our revenue and could lead to price erosion that would adversely affect our operating results. We rely on third party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry standard wafers and assembly/test services, and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test subcontractors and on third party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry standard digital processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Additionally, we utilize third party wafer fabricators as sole source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications. We have no written supply agreements with these sole source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders. If these sole source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. Our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity. Our capacity additions in fiscal 2001 resulted in a significant increase in operating expenses. If revenue levels do not increase enough to offset these additional expense levels, our future operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time. Should we be unsuccessful in completing this expansion on time, or should customer demand fail to increase and we no longer need the additional capacity, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our transition of products to more modern facilities and related inventory builds may not progress as planned. We are transitioning products from our older four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six inch and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities. We have built inventory in preparation for this transfer for both lifetime supply and transition inventory. We have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds. Although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If we are unable to transition our products as planned or if actual demand for products included in our inventory builds is less than our estimates, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our manufacturing processes are highly technical and may be interrupted. We have both generic and proprietary manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, 29 Table of Contents contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages. We rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and services. We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in California and Taiwan as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport. In addition, California has experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has been negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for us, without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to economic, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. During fiscal 2002, approximately 70% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and Taiwan. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the United States economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the response to them by the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates, tax and tariff rates, freight rates and social and political unrest. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies. We are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it. We believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience, innovation, and management skill. There also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or reverse engineer our products, or that our confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report 30 Table of Contents on Form 10 K for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. We rely primarily upon know how, rather than on patents, to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests. Other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. Leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we issued $1,200,000,000 of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2005 and, as a result, we have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. We may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on, and other amounts due in respect of, this indebtedness when due. Our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences. This substantial leverage could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. It may require the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures. It may also limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees. Our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives. A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributors initiative, could disrupt our current business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives, our operating results could be adversely affected. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure In January 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $1,200 million convertible subordinated notes. The effect of the swap was to convert our 4.75% fixed rate to a variable rate, currently based on the 3 month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. If LIBOR increases or decreases by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would change by $12 million for fiscal 2002. Changes in interest rates would affect the fair value of the interest rate swap and the fair value of the debt obligation. For each basis point change in the swap curve, the fair value in fiscal 2002 would change by approximately $0.3 million. The fair value of the swap, and therefore the related debt obligation, would also be affected by the price and volatility of our common stock. Our annual interest income would change by approximately $28 million for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. Therefore, the effect to our interest income, net of interest expense, would be approximately $16 million in fiscal year 2002 and $24 million in fiscal 2001. The fair values of our investment portfolio at November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001 would not be significantly impacted by either an increase or decrease in interest rates primarily due to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from three months to one year. The short term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is against the Euro, primarily because Europe has a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 32 Table of Contents
