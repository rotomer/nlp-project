ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Fiscal Year 2003 Overview Overall, fiscal 2003 was a better year for Analog Devices than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. We recorded net sales of $2,047 million in fiscal 2003, which was a 20% increase over the amount recorded in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 was the low point in the current cycle in the industry when revenues were down 25% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2001. However, the gradual recovery, which started for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, continued throughout fiscal 2003. Our gross margins improved to 54.9% in fiscal 2003 from 53% in fiscal 2002 and diluted earnings per share improved to $0.78 per share in fiscal 2003 from $0.28 per share in fiscal 2002. We generated $433 million in operating cash during the year and finished the year with $2,117 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments after redeeming all of our $1,200 million outstanding debt. Fiscal 2003 Results of Operations Compared to Fiscal 2002 Sales Net sales were $2,047 million in fiscal 2003, an increase of 20% from net sales of $1,708 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2003 was attributable to increased demand for analog and DSP products used in wireless handsets, in desktop and laptop computers and for analog products used in consumer applications such as digital cameras and flat panel displays. Sales of analog and DSP products used in wireless infrastructure and broadband access grew slightly in fiscal 2003 and sales of broadband infrastructure applications decreased in fiscal 2003 from the levels recorded in the prior year. We experienced a slow steady improvement in demand for products used in industrial applications during fiscal 2003, particularly analog products used in automotive and automatic test equipment. In general, demand during fiscal 2003 was strongest for products that are used by consumers while demand for products used in applications that depend on industrial, enterprise or carrier capital spending were flat. During fiscal 2003 analog product sales increased 16% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002. DSP product sales increased by 35% from the prior year during fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, approximately 78% of our net sales were from analog products, down from 80% in the prior year. DSP product sales represented the remaining 22% and 20% respectively, of our net sales in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. Sales of new products, which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters, were 19% of net sales in fiscal 2003 as compared to 21% in fiscal 2002. The year over year dollar increase in sales of new products was 8% in fiscal 2003 and was attributable to design wins for some of our communications, consumer and computer products. This increase followed declines of 17% and 33% respectively, in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 as we went through the down turn of the current cycle in the semiconductor industry. The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last two years is as follows: Region Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 North America 26 % 30 % Europe 19 % 21 % Japan 18 % 17 % Southeast Asia 37 % 32 % The fiscal 2003 decrease in North American sales and the increase in Southeast Asia sales as a percentage of total net sales were principally attributable to the ongoing transfer of customer manufacturing activity to Asia. Sales in dollars increased in fiscal 2003 by 38% and 29% in Southeast Asia and Japan, respectively, as a result of increased demand for products used in communications, consumer and computer applications as well as the ongoing transfer of manufacturing activity to locations primarily in Asia. Sales in dollars in fiscal 2003 increased by 12% in Europe as a result of the steady improvement in demand for our 15 Table of Contents products during the year. The slight increase in North America sales in dollars was attributable to increased regional demand for our products that was largely offset by the transfer of customer manufacturing activity to locations in Asia. Gross Margin Gross margin improved in fiscal 2003 to $1,124 million, or 54.9% of net sales, up 190 basis points from fiscal 2002 gross margin of $905 million, or 53% of net sales. This improvement was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an increasing sales level each quarter and, to a lesser extent, the impact of restructuring actions we took over the last two years and continued cost constraints at our manufacturing operations. Research and Development Research and development, or R&D, expenses amounted to $450 million in fiscal 2003, an increase of $26 million or 6% from the $424 million recorded in fiscal 2002. R&D expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to 22% in fiscal 2003 from 24.8% in fiscal 2002 as a result of the 20% year to year increase in revenue and only a 6% year to year increase in R&D expenses. The year to year increase in R&D expenses was limited to 6% as a result of acquisition related expenses declining year to year by $5.6 million and the company limiting discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees and curtailing hiring to strategically important new hires and college hires. The reduction in acquisition related expenses to $8.2 million in fiscal 2003 from $13.8 million in fiscal 2002 arose primarily because fiscal 2002 costs included expense related to fixed value contingent compensation and the achievement of final performance based criteria that did not recur in fiscal 2003. R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical for future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative Selling, marketing, general and administrative, or SMG&A, expenses were $288 million in fiscal 2003, an increase of $31 million, or 12%, from the $257 million recorded in fiscal 2002. As a percentage of net sales, SMG&A declined to 14% for fiscal 2003 from 15% in fiscal 2002 primarily due to the increase in net sales. The increase in SMG&A expenses in dollars was primarily the result of increased commission expenses paid due to the 20% year to year increase in net sales, the decision to add additional field application engineers to assist customers and potential customers design products that incorporate ADI technology to address their specific requirements, as well as initiatives to publicize new products. These increases were offset by limiting discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $3 million for fiscal 2003 compared with $57 million for fiscal 2002. The decrease in amortization expense was the result of our fiscal 2003 adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Special Charges During fiscal 2003, we recorded special charges of $9.5 million, and during fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges totaling $48.5 million. Special charges recorded over the last three fiscal years are more fully described under the heading Special Charges below. 16 Table of Contents Operating Income Our operating income was $374 million, or 18.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2003, compared to $118 million, or 6.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. Nonoperating Income and Expense Interest expense was $32 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $44 million in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 includes interest expense for 12 months and fiscal 2003 includes interest expense for only 11 months because we redeemed our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or notes, on October 1, 2003. In addition, an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in January 2002 had the effect of swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of our notes into a LIBOR based floating rate which was 1.61% as of November 6, 2002 and was 1.14% at the time we redeemed our notes on October 1, 2003. These two items resulted in the year to year decline in interest expense. Interest income was $41 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $65 million in fiscal 2002. The year to year decrease in interest income was attributable to less income earned on our invested cash balances due to the decline in interest rates during fiscal 2003 as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and our decision to increase our holdings of higher credit quality yet lower interest bearing investments. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate decreased to 22% for fiscal 2003 as compared to 25% for fiscal 2002. The decrease was primarily the result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of our adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill was treated as a permanent difference in prior years tax provisions which had the effect of increasing our effective income tax rate. Net Income Fiscal 2003 net income was $298 million, or 14.6% of net sales, and diluted earnings per share was $0.78 compared to net income in fiscal 2002 of $105 million, or 6.2% of net sales, and diluted earnings per share of $0.28. The fiscal 2003 increase in net income from fiscal 2002 was primarily due to increased revenue levels and, to a lesser extent, the cessation of goodwill amortization and reduced expenses related to special charges. The impact of inflation on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Related Party Transactions One of our directors, who has been a director since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002. We purchased approximately $232 million and $206 million of products from TSMC in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. We believe that the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties. Approximately $14 million and $19 million was payable to TSMC as of November 1, 2003 and November 2, 2002, respectively. We anticipate that we will make similar purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal 2003 net cash flow provided by operations was $433 million, or 21% of net sales, an increase of $207 million over the prior year. The year over year increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of $193 million. In addition, we received $71 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs. These cash inflows were offset by a net payment of $1,198 million related to the redemption of all of our outstanding notes together with the associated redemption premium and the termination of the related interest rate swap and loan agreement and capital expenditures of $68 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments decreased $781 million during fiscal 2003 to $2,117 million at November 1, 2003 from $2,898 million at November 2, 2002 primarily as a result of these activities. Accounts receivable of $295 million at the end of fiscal 2003 increased $67 million, or 29%, from $228 million at the end of fiscal 2002. This increase resulted principally from a $102 million increase in net 17 Table of Contents sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Days sales outstanding increased from 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 to 48 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The year to year increase in days sales outstanding was due to a higher level of sales in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Inventories declined by $19 million, or 6%, from the end of fiscal 2002 to $288 million at the end of fiscal 2003. Days cost of sales in inventory declined by 29 days to 106 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The decrease in inventory in dollars was attributable to tight control of inventory levels as well as increasing demand for our products as the year progressed. In response to the slowdown in our served markets in fiscal 2001 and 2002, we have substantially reduced our capital spending in the last two years. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $68 million in fiscal 2003 and $57 million in fiscal 2002, which represented approximately 3% of net sales for each of those years. Fiscal 2004 capital expenditures are expected to return to historical levels of 5% of annual net sales, or approximately $130 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we redeemed for cash all of our outstanding notes. The redemption price was 101.90% of the principal amount of the notes, or $1,223 million. A net pre tax loss of $0.2 million was recognized in other expense as a result of the redemption, comprised of a $10.8 million gain on the redemption of the notes which was offset by a write off of $11 million of deferred financing costs. The gain on the redemption of the notes was due to the carrying value of the notes being greater than the redemption value as a result of the mark to market of the interest rate component of the notes to fair value. As a result, apart from operating lease obligations, we had no debt at the end of fiscal year 2003. On November 17, 2003, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.04 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend was paid on December 17, 2003 and was approximately $15 million. The payment of future dividends will be based on our quarterly financial performance. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 1, 2003: Payment due by period (thousands) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leases $ 51,448 $ 15,322 $ 22,809 $ 8,953 $ 4,364 At November 1, 2003, our principal source of liquidity was $2,117 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Outlook Analog Devices is in a strong financial position entering fiscal 2004. We are planning for annual revenue growth of approximately 25%, with gross margins continuing to improve through the year. Similar to fiscal 2003, we anticipate that our operating expenses will grow at a rate well below our revenue growth rate. Our goal remains to increase our earnings at a rate that is twice the growth rate of our sales until we reach our model operating results. We currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $130 million in fiscal 2004. Depreciation expense is expected to decrease to $155 million in fiscal 2004 from $166 million in fiscal 2003. We anticipate that our effective tax rate will remain relatively flat year to year at approximately 22%. As a result of increased demand for our products during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we are planning for revenues to increase 5% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 to the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and for diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.28 in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. 18 Table of Contents Fiscal 2002 Results of Operations Compared to Fiscal 2001 Fiscal 2002 was a challenging year for Analog Devices. The decrease in net sales from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 was due to the declining demand in several markets that we serve, particularly the communications market, as well as an overall decline in the general economy. Quarterly sales reached $806 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 but declined rapidly throughout fiscal 2001 and reached the lowest point in this cycle in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, for which quarter we recorded sales of $393 million. In the last three quarters of fiscal 2002, we experienced a steady sequential improvement in demand and sales reached $456 million in the fourth quarter. During this downturn, we maintained gross margins at 53% in fiscal 2002 and, as a result of decisive cost containment measures we undertook, we reduced operating expenses year to year by 9%. Cash flow remained strong with cash increasing by over $100 million during fiscal 2002 to $2,900 million after we purchased $100 million of our common stock. Profit and loss account year to year changes are summarized as follows: Net sales were $1,708 million, down 25% from $2,277 million in fiscal 2001 as a result of the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor market. The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for fiscal years 2002 and 2001 is set out below. The decline in North American sales and increase in Southeast Asia sales as a percentage of total sales was primarily due to a decline in the communications market in fiscal 2002 combined with the transfer of customer manufacturing activity to other locations, primarily in Asia. Region Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2001 North America 30 % 39 % Europe 21 % 24 % Japan 17 % 15 % Southeast Asia 32 % 22 % Cost of sales was $803 million in fiscal 2002, down from $1,008 million in fiscal 2001. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we announced that we would transition products from our older four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six inch and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities that were then operating well below capacity. As a result, the remaining service lives of certain assets within our wafer fabrication facilities were shortened. Depreciation expense included in cost of sales included additional depreciation of approximately $8.7 million in fiscal 2002 associated with the shortened lives of some equipment in our older four inch wafer fabrication facilities. Gross margin in fiscal 2002 was $905 million, or 53% of net sales, down from $1,269 million, or 55.7% of net sales, in the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to the year to year decrease in revenue and lower utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities. R&D expenses declined from $465 million in fiscal 2001 to $424 million in fiscal 2002. The decline was primarily the result of the elimination of bonuses and the temporary reduction of salaries for our more highly compensated employees partially offset by an increase in acquisition related expenses and selective hiring of engineers. R&D expenses increased from 20.4% of net sales in fiscal 2001 to 24.8% of net sales in fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of the 25% decline in sales year to year. SMG&A expenses declined by $30 million to $257 million in fiscal 2002, from the $287 million recorded in fiscal 2001. The decline year to year was due to the elimination of bonuses, the temporary reduction in salaries for our highly compensated employees and tight control over all discretionary expenses. These reductions were offset by our decision to increase our field applications engineers in order to help our customers design in our newest products. SMG&A expenses increased from 12.6% of net sales in fiscal 2001 to 15% of net sales in fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of the reduced sales levels. Amortization of intangibles was $57 million in fiscal 2002, up from $53 million recorded in fiscal 2001. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to amortization of goodwill for the full 19 Table of Contents year associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal 2001 where amortization commenced during fiscal 2001. Special charges recorded in fiscal 2002 and 2001 were $48 million and $47 million, respectively. Special charges recorded over the last three fiscal years are more fully described under the heading Special Charges below. Operating income was $118 million, or 6.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2002, compared to $408 million, or 17.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. Nonoperating Income and Expense Interest expense was $44 million and $62 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease year to year was the result of an interest rate swap agreement entered into in January 2002 that had the effect of swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of our $1,200 million convertible subordinated notes into a LIBOR based floating rate (1.61% as of November 6, 2002). Interest income declined from $133 million in fiscal 2001 to $65 million in fiscal 2002 as a result of less income earned on our invested cash balances due to a decline in interest rates during fiscal 2002. Other income declined approximately $28 million from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to a one time gain on the sale of an investment in WaferTech recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Our effective income tax rate decreased from 29.7% for fiscal 2001 to 25% for fiscal 2002 as a result of a shift in the mix of worldwide profits. Net income decreased to $105 million, or 6.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2002 from $356 million, or 15.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. This decrease in net income was primarily due to reduced revenue levels. Liquidity and Capital Resource changes year to year are summarized as follows: Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments amounted to $2,898 million at November 2, 2002, up $105 million from $2,793 million at November 3, 2001. The increase of $105 million was the result of operating cash inflows of $226 million (13% of fiscal 2002 net sales) and $37 million of proceeds from employee stock plans, offset by a $98 million repurchase of shares of our common stock and $57 million of capital expenditures. Accounts receivable increased by $10 million to $228 million from $218 million at the end of fiscal 2001, as a result of a $32 million increase in fourth quarter sales year to year. Days sales outstanding remained flat at 46 days for both fiscal year end 2001 and 2002. Inventory increased by $60 million, or 24%, to $306 million at the end of fiscal 2002. The inventory increase was primarily the result of a build in die bank inventory in preparation for the transfer of production from our four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities and the purchase of external wafers in support of expected demand in our handset and consumer analog business. We acquired five companies during fiscal 2001, as more fully described below under the heading Acquisitions. Total cash used to purchase these companies was approximately $38.5 million in 2001 and another $5.2 million was paid in fiscal 2002 as certain operational objectives were achieved, and these additional payments were accounted for as additional goodwill. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $57 million in fiscal 2002, down from $297 million in fiscal 2001. The sharp year to year reduction in capital spending was in response to the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry worldwide. Special Charges Special Charges Fiscal 2003 During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $0.3 million. The charge included a $2.0 million write down of equipment to fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in 20 Table of Contents plastic packages, which had been done internally at our facility in the Philippines. This amount was the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly, net of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets. We also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in the write down of $2.7 million of equipment to fair value. During the quarter ended August 2, 2003, we determined that the costs remaining to be paid for certain restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally recorded. Accordingly, we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring accruals by $4.4 million related to prior restructuring charges as more fully described below. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $9.2 million as a result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in Belfast, Northern Ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical applications. The charge included $2 million of severance costs for approximately 57 manufacturing employees and 14 engineering and administrative employees, none of whom had been terminated as of November 1, 2003. The charge also included $6 million related to the write down of property, plant and equipment to fair value and $1.2 million related to the write down of various other assets to fair values. The closure is anticipated to be completed during the first half of fiscal 2004. We anticipate annual savings from the above actions of approximately $7 million, of which half is in cost of sales and half is in operating expenses. Of the $9.5 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2003, $2 million related to separation costs remained accrued as of November 1, 2003. All remaining severance will be paid in the first half of fiscal 2004. Special Charges Fiscal 2002 During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $27.2 million. The second quarter charge was comprised of $25.7 million related to the planned transfer of production from our three older four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our three six inch and one eight inch wafer fabrication facilities, and $3 million primarily related to the impairment of an investment, which was partially offset by an adjustment of $1.5 million related to equipment cancelation fees recorded in fiscal year 2001. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. Included in the $25.7 million special charge were severance and fringe benefit costs of $15.3 million for 509 manufacturing employees in the United States and Ireland, $2.3 million related to the write down of equipment to be abandoned and $8.1 million of other charges, primarily related to lease termination and cleanup costs. The write down of equipment was principally due to a decision to discontinue various product development strategies. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we reversed $2.9 million of the accrual primarily due to lower than previously expected severance costs. The lower severance costs were the result of a reduction in the number of separated employees and, to a lesser extent, the average tenure of separated employees differing from estimates. The 509 employees projected to be terminated at the time of the original charge was adjusted down to 439, and as of November 1, 2003, 397 employees had been terminated. The reduction in the number of employees to be terminated was due to the transfer of employees, which primarily occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, to positions in our six inch wafer fabrication facilities where we experienced an unexpected increase in demand for our products. The process of ceasing production in the four inch wafer fabrication facilities is complete. The equipment disposition and clean up activity is underway at each site and the related clean up costs, which were included in the special charge, will be expended as this activity is completed. The remaining clean up will be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Since severance costs are paid as income continuance at some locations, these amounts will be expended over time subsequent to the final termination of employment. We anticipate annual savings from the above actions of approximately $60 million, primarily in cost of sales, and the first full years impact will be fiscal 2004. In addition to the above special charges, the remaining service lives of certain assets within the older four inch wafer fabrication facilities were shortened. As a result, cost of sales for the fiscal year 2002 included additional depreciation of approximately $8.7 million associated with the shortened lives. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $12.8 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $3.7 million related to cost reduction actions taken in 21 Table of Contents several product groups and, to a lesser extent, in manufacturing, $3.8 million related to the impairment of an investment, $3.4 million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the closing of an Austrian design center acquired in fiscal 2001 and $1.9 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. The severance and fringe benefit costs were for approximately 70 engineering employees in the United States, Europe and Canada, and approximately 30 manufacturing employees in the United States. All of the manufacturing employees and substantially all of the engineering employees had been terminated as of November 1, 2003. The workforce reductions are anticipated to result in annual savings of approximately $10 million, primarily in operating expenses. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $8.4 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $2.5 million related to cost reduction actions taken in the sales group, several product groups and our manufacturing test operations for approximately 65 employees in the United States and Europe, all of which had been terminated as of November 1, 2003. The charges also included $2.1 million related to the impairment of investments, $1.8 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees and a change in estimate of $2.0 million for additional estimated clean up costs originally recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The investment impairment charges were related to the decline in fair value of a publicly traded equity investment to less than its cost basis that was determined to be other than temporary, and to an equity investment in a private company. The private company equity investment was part of a product strategy that we decided to abandon. The workforce reductions are anticipated to result in annual savings of approximately $4 million, primarily in operating expenses. Of the $48.5 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2002, $3.2 million primarily related to clean up costs and $4.7 million related to separation costs, primarily being paid as income continuance, remained accrued as of November 1, 2003. Special Charges Fiscal 2001 During fiscal 2001, we recorded special charges of approximately $47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the economic climate at that time. The actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas as well as a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities. The cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of $29.6 million for approximately 1,200 employees in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Philippines, substantially all of which had been terminated as of November 1, 2003. The special charges also included $11.6 million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations and $5.8 million of other charges primarily related to equipment and lease cancelation fees. Based on the results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order cancelation fees, the amount paid was $1.5 million less than the amount recorded for such charges and, accordingly, we adjusted the provision for purchase order cancelation fees by $1.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 to reflect this change in estimate. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we determined that the severance costs remaining to be paid would be $1.3 million less than the amount originally recorded for these charges and also determined that $0.2 million originally reserved for the termination of two leases would not be required. Therefore, we adjusted the provision for these severance and other costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 to reflect this change in estimate. The impact in fiscal 2002 of these cost savings was approximately $30 million, consisting of a $20 million reduction in cost of sales and a $10 million reduction in operating expenses. Of the $47.0 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2001, $1.4 million remained accrued as of November 1, 2003, and primarily represents severance payments being paid as income continuance to certain of the 1,200 terminated employees, predominantly in the U.S., substantially all of which will be paid by the end of fiscal 2004. 22 Table of Contents Acquisitions During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the following acquisitions: In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the acquisitions of Thomas Neuroth AG, Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd. and Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc. The total amount paid for these acquisitions, as of November 1, 2003, was $10.2 million. As of November 1, 2003, the remaining contingent consideration was $1.1 million. In order to be entitled to receive the contingent consideration, the former shareholders of Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc., who are employed by Analog, must continue to be employed by Analog. As such, the contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense. On January 4, 2001, we acquired ChipLogic, Inc. of Santa Clara, California. ChipLogic is a developer of high performance integrated circuits and software focused on the convergence of voice, broadband access and network protocol processing. The total purchase price of $68.3 million consisted of cash of approximately $4 million, approximately 1 million shares of our common stock valued at $60.2 million and the assumption of $4.1 million of outstanding ChipLogic vested stock options. The fair value of our common stock issued was determined based on the average market price of our common stock for the seven day period, including three days before and after the date the acquisition was announced and the terms of the acquisition were agreed upon. Approximately $9.5 million represented the purchase price of in process technology and was charged to operations during fiscal 2001 because the software project had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The in process technology related to software developed to handle voice processing, signaling, packet management and routing, quality of service and networking interface functions. This software is embedded in a network processor that provides for a wide area to local area network bridge. The fair value of the in process technology was determined by a third party using the income forecast method, which is a discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in process technology was approximately 40% complete. The in process technology was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Expenditures to complete the in process technology totaled $14 million, representing primarily personnel costs. An additional $8 million of cash consideration and 489,375 shares of common stock were due and payable in the event that the former shareholders and key employees remain employed at Analog and upon the achievement of certain operational objectives. Of these shares, 249,375 shares have been issued to the former shareholders and have a fixed value of $13 million. This amount is being charged ratably to operations over a five year period based on continuing employment. Accordingly, the issuance of these shares is compensatory and is treated as compensation expense over the service period. The remaining 240,000 shares were subject to operational performance based criteria and were only issuable to those former shareholders and key employees who remained employed at Analog at the time the operational milestones were met. Accordingly, the issuance of these shares was compensatory and was recorded as compensation expense when the achievement of each defined contractual milestone became probable. As of November 2, 2002, all of the operational milestones had been met and approximately $5.0 million and $4.2 million of expense was recorded related to the issuance of the shares in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. As of November 1, 2003, there was approximately $4.9 million of contingent consideration remaining to be paid. An additional $2.8 million of compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal 2005 related to the assumption of unvested stock options. On January 16, 2001, we acquired Staccato Systems, Inc. of Mountain View, California. Staccato is in the field of audio synthesis technology. The total purchase price of $23.8 million consisted of $23 million in cash and the assumption of $0.8 million of vested outstanding Staccato stock options. We paid an additional $7 million to the selling shareholders related to the achievement of operational objectives. These payments were accounted for as additional purchase price and recorded to goodwill because the payments were not contingent on continued employment by the former shareholders of Staccato who became Analog employees. We paid contingent consideration payments to the former shareholders of $5 million and $2 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. No additional contingent consideration payments will be made. An additional $0.2 million of compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal 2005 related to the assumption of unvested stock options. 23 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (FAS 141), Business Combinations, and No. 142 (FAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. FAS 142, which became effective for our company in fiscal year 2003, prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. FAS 142 requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Other intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under FAS 144. We test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed by FAS 142. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures the amount of the impairment, if any. In the first step, if the fair value of the reporting unit(s) exceed(s) the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value of the reporting unit(s) exceed(s) the fair value, goodwill is potentially impaired and we must complete step two in order to measure the impairment loss. Step two compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We adopted FAS 142 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Application of the nonamortization provisions of FAS 142 resulted in an increase in annual net income of $44 million in fiscal 2003. We completed the required impairment test of goodwill upon adoption of FAS 142 as of November 3, 2002 in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The results of the impairment review indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill. We also performed the annual impairment test as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and the results indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill. See further discussion under Note 2f. Goodwill and Other Acquisition related Intangibles. Effective November 3, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (FAS 143), Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The adoption of FAS 143 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Effective November 3, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (FAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets. This statement supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and the accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of a business of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. The adoption of FAS 144 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Effective November 3, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 (FAS 145), Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. Under FAS 145, gains and losses on extinguishments of debt are classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than extraordinary items. The adoption of FAS 145 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (FAS 146), Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Costs covered by FAS 146 include lease termination costs and certain one time employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. This statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. FAS 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future exit or disposal costs, if any, as well as the amounts recognized. 24 Table of Contents Effective November 3, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (FAS 148), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transitions and Disclosure. FAS 148 amends FAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition to FAS 123s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. FAS 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of FAS 123 and APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entitys accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. While FAS 148 does not amend FAS 123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method, the disclosure provisions of FAS 148 are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation, regardless of whether they account for stock based compensation using the fair value method of FAS 123 or the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. We have adopted the disclosure requirements of FAS 148 and will continue to account for stock based compensation plans in accordance with APB 25. In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 (FAS 149), Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under FAS 133. FAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The adoption of FAS 149 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 (FAS 150), Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. FAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. This Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of FAS 150 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must disclose and recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement requirement of FIN 45 is effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. As of November 1, 2003, the fair value of our guarantees that were issued or modified after December 31, 2002 was not material. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45, which are effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. Under the terms of the lease agreement, which was entered into prior to January 1, 2003, related to our headquarters facility in Norwood, Massachusetts, we have agreed to assume the note related to the property in the event of default by the lessor. Assumption of the note, which was approximately $8.8 million at November 1, 2003, would entitle us to a first lien on the property. The lease expires in May 2007. The guarantee was made by us to allow the lessor to obtain a lower cost of borrowing. We have also provided certain indemnities under which we may be required to make payments to an indemnified party in connection with certain transactions and agreements, in particular with respect to certain acquisitions and divestitures, we have provided customary indemnities for such matters as environmental, tax, product and employee liabilities. In addition, in connection with various other agreements, including subsidiary banking agreements, we may provide routine guarantees. Generally, because a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated, the potential amount of future maximum payments cannot be reasonably estimated, and therefore, we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities in the consolidated financial statements. The duration of the indemnities varies, and in many cases is indefinite. 25 Table of Contents In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity. FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2003. We are required to adopt the provisions of FIN 46 in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments by us about future demand for our inventory. Additionally, we have built inventory in preparation for the transfer of production from our four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities for both lifetime supply and transition inventory. We have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds. Although we believe that we have used our best efforts and available information to estimate future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. Long Lived Assets and Goodwill We review property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future 26 Table of Contents periods. Evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted the new rules of FAS 142 for measuring and assessing goodwill for impairment. As required by FAS 142, all remaining and future acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The estimates and assumptions described above along with other factors such as discount rates will affect the amount of an impairment loss, if any, we recognize under FAS 142. We are required to test goodwill for impairment, which may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. FAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At November 1, 2003, we had deferred tax assets of $144 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. While these assets are not assured of realization, we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization and concluded that no significant valuation allowance is required. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In addition, we have provided for potential liabilities due in various foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, or FAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with FAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect, we 27 Table of Contents may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains or incorporates forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and managements beliefs and assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on our behalf. Words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading Factors That May Affect Future Results that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make. We do not intend to update publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Long term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. In certain markets where end user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our backlog. As a result, we are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp fall off of sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet the customers unique requirements so that those canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets. Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. There can be 28 Table of Contents no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. We may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future. Many other companies offer products that compete with our products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. We rely on third party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry standard wafers and assembly/test services, and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test subcontractors and on third party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Additionally, we utilize third party wafer fabricators as sole source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications. We have no written supply agreements with these sole source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders. If these sole source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. We may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and short term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. During these periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to these periods of increased demand. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers has led to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase. Should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. 29 Table of Contents We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. We rely primarily upon know how, rather than on patents, to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests. Other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. We are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it. We believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience, innovation and management skill. There also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or reverse engineer our products, or that our confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See Note 12 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees. We rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and services. We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in California as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport. In addition, California has 30 Table of Contents experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has been negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for us, without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to economic, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. During fiscal year 2003, approximately 74% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies. We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the United States economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, and additional costs related to tax, tariff and freight rates. Our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives. A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributors initiative, could disrupt our current business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted. We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Our transition of products to more modern facilities and related inventory builds may not progress as planned. We are transitioning products from our older four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six inch and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities. We have built inventory in preparation for this transfer for both lifetime supply and transition inventory. We have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds. Although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If actual demand for products included in our inventory builds is less than our estimates, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Our annual interest income would change by approximately $29 million in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at November 1, 2003 and November 2, 2002 would not be significantly impacted by either an increase or decrease in interest rates primarily due to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to six months. The short term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at November 1, 2003 and November 2, 2002. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is against the Euro, primarily because Europe has a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 1, 2003 and November 2, 2002, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 32 Table of Contents
