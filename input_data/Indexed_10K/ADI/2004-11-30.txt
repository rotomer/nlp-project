ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts and as noted) Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 Net Sales $ 2,633,800 $ 2,047,268 $ 1,707,508 Gross Margin % 59 % 54.9 % 53 % Diluted EPS $ 1.45 $ 0.78 $ 0.28 Net Income $ 570,738 $ 298,281 $ 105,299 Net Income as a % of Sales 21.7 % 14.6 % 6.2 % Fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were successful years for Analog Devices. During these two fiscal years we experienced a continuation of what we believe is a broad based cyclical improvement in the semiconductor industry that began for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. We began fiscal year 2004 with a plan to increase net sales by approximately 25% and for gross margins to continue to improve during the year. Net sales increased by 29% to $2,634 million in fiscal 2004 up from the $2,047 million recorded in the prior year. Our gross margins improved by 410 basis points to 59% in fiscal 2004, up from 54.9% recorded in fiscal 2003. For fiscal 2004 we had anticipated that operating expenses would grow at a rate significantly less than that of our revenue growth rate. Operating expenses for the fiscal year increased 14% year to year, or slightly less than half the growth rate of net sales for the year. Diluted earnings per share improved to $1.45 per share in fiscal 2004, up 86% from the $0.78 per share recorded in fiscal 2003. Net cash provided by operations was $778 million, or 29.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Sales Net sales recorded in fiscal 2004 were $2,634 million, an increase of 29% over net sales of $2,047 million recorded in fiscal 2003. The $587 million increase in net sales in fiscal 2004 was a result of what we believe was a broad based increase in demand for our products used in every end market we serve. Increased demand for our products used in industrial products and communications products accounted for approximately 77% of this year to year increase and increased demand for our products used in consumer and computer end markets accounted for the remaining increase in net sales. Increased demand for our products used in wireless handsets and infrastructure was the main reason for our increased sales in the communications end market. For fiscal 2003, net sales of $2,047 million increased by 20% from the $1,708 million recorded in fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, demand was very strong for our products used in consumer products, while demand was relatively flat for our products used in applications that depend on industrial, enterprise or carrier capital spending. As a result, demand for analog and DSP products used in wireless handsets, desktop and laptop computers, consumer products such as digital cameras and flat panel displays increased in fiscal 2003 above the levels experienced in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2004, analog product sales increased 31% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, analog product sales increased 16% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2004, DSP product sales increased by 21% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 after increasing 35% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002. Over the last three fiscal years, net sales from analog products were in the range of 78% to 80% of net sales and sales of DSP products represented the remaining 20% to 22% of net sales. Sales of new products, which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters, were 21% of net sales in fiscal 2004 as compared to 19% in fiscal 2003 and 21% in fiscal 2002. The year over year dollar increase in sales of new products was 45% in fiscal 2004 and was attributable to increased demand and design wins for some of our products used in communications, industrial, consumer and computer applications. This increase followed a year to year dollar increase in sales of new products of 8% in fiscal 2003 and a year to year 15 Table of Contents decline of sales of new products of 17% in fiscal 2002 as we went through a down turn in the semiconductor industry. The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2004 2003 2002 North America 25 % 26 % 30 % Europe 20 % 21 % 22 % Japan 19 % 18 % 17 % China 14 % 11 % 8 % Rest of Asia 22 % 24 % 23 % The decrease in North American and European sales and the increase in sales in Asia and Japan as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were attributable to the ongoing transfer of customer manufacturing activity to Asia and increased demand for our products in Japan and in Asia, particularly in China. The increase in sales in dollar terms in Japan was 36% and 29%, respectively, for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, and was the result of a general recovery in demand for our products in Japan and in particular an increase in demand for our products used in the manufacture of automatic test equipment and consumer products. Sales in dollars increased in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 by 73% and 75%, respectively, in China and by 16% and 27%, respectively, in the Rest of Asia as a result of increased demand for products used in communications, industrial, consumer, and computer products. In fiscal 2004, sales in dollar terms increased by 20% in Europe and 24% in North America because of the broad based improvement in demand for our products used in industrial, communications, consumer and computer products. Sales in dollars in fiscal 2003 increased by 12% as compared to fiscal 2002 in Europe as a result of the steady improvement in demand for our products during the year. The slight increase in fiscal 2003 North America sales in dollars as compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable to increased demand for our products that was largely offset by the transfer of customer manufacturing activity to locations in Asia. Gross Margin Gross margin improved in fiscal 2004 to $1,554 million, or 59% of net sales, up 410 basis points from the gross margin of $1,124 million, or 54.9% of net sales, recorded in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2002, gross margins were $905 million, or 53% of net sales. The improvement in gross margins for both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an increasing sales level and, to a lesser extent, the impact of restructuring actions taken in recent years as well as continued tight cost control at our manufacturing operations. Research and Development Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 Research and Development (R&D) Expenses $ 511,732 $ 450,232 $ 423,869 R&D Expenses as a % of Net Sales 19.4 % 22.0 % 24.8 % R&D expenses for fiscal 2004 increased by $62 million, or 14%, to $512 million from the $450 million recorded in fiscal 2003. R&D expenses increased $26 million, or 6%, to $450 million in fiscal 2003 from the $424 million recorded in fiscal 2002. R&D expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to 19.4% in fiscal 2004 from 22% in fiscal 2003 and from 24.8% in fiscal 2002 as a result of the 29% and 20% year to year increase in revenue for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. R&D expenses increased by 14% year to year in fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of additional salary and benefit costs associated with a 5% increase in engineering headcount during the year. These expenses also increased as a result of annual salary increases and increased bonus payments and, to a lesser extent, an increase in other engineering expenses reflecting the increased R&D activity during the year. For fiscal 2003, the year to year increase in R&D expenses was 16 Table of Contents limited to 6% as a result of acquisition related expenses declining year to year by $5.6 million and the company limiting discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees and curtailing hiring to strategically important new hires and college hires. The reduction in acquisition related expenses to $8.2 million in fiscal 2003 from $13.8 million in fiscal 2002 arose primarily because fiscal 2002 costs included additional expenses related to fixed value contingent compensation and the achievement of final performance based criteria that did not recur in fiscal 2003. R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 SMG&A Expenses $ 340,036 $ 288,009 $ 257,054 SMG&A Expenses as a % of Net Sales 12.9 % 14.0 % 15.1 % SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2004 by $52 million, or 18%, from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, the increase in SMG&A expenses was $31 million, or 12%, from the $257 million recorded in fiscal 2002. As a percentage of net sales, SMG&A declined over the past two fiscal years primarily due to the increases in net sales for each of those years. For fiscal 2004, the increase in SMG&A expenses over the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of increased salary and employee benefit costs and bonus payments to employees, increased commission payments as a result of the 29% year to year increase in net sales and, to a lesser extent, increased legal costs associated with patent and intellectual property activity and other expense increases associated with selling and marketing activities. The increase in SMG&A expenses in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 was primarily the result of increased commission amounts paid due to the 20% year to year increase in net sales, the decision to add additional field application engineers to assist existing and potential customers to design products that incorporate ADI technology to address their specific requirements, as well as initiatives to publicize new products. These increases were offset by limitations on discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $3 million for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 compared with $57 million for fiscal 2002. The decrease in amortization expense in fiscal 2003 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002 was the result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective November 3, 2002, which results in goodwill no longer being amortized. Special Charges During fiscal 2003, we recorded special charges of $9.5 million, and during fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges totaling $48.5 million. Special charges recorded in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 are more fully described under the heading Special Charges below. There were no special charges recorded in fiscal 2004. Operating Income Our operating income was $699 million, or 26.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2004, compared to $374 million, or 18.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2004 over the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 was a result of the 410 basis point year to year improvement in gross margin combined with operating expense increases that were limited to 14%, which was less than half 17 Table of Contents the 29% increase in net sales for the year. Operating income was $118 million, or 6.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. Nonoperating Income and Expense Interest expense was $0.2 million in fiscal 2004, $32 million in fiscal 2003 and $44 million in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 included interest expense for only 11 months and fiscal 2002 included interest expense for 12 months as we redeemed our $1,200 million 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or notes, on October 1, 2003. In addition, an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in January 2002 had the effect of swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of our notes into a LIBOR based floating rate that was 1.61% as of November 6, 2002 and was 1.14% at the time we redeemed our notes on October 1, 2003. These two items resulted in the year to year decline in interest expense from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Interest income was $36 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $41 million in fiscal 2003 and $65 million in fiscal 2002. The year to year decrease in interest income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable to lower average invested cash balances in fiscal 2004 due to the note redemption in 2003. This was partially mitigated by our decision in fiscal 2004 to increase our holdings of longer term, high credit quality bonds, which offer higher yields than shorter term investments, and higher interest rates later in fiscal 2004 as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board. The year to year decrease in interest income in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable to less income earned on our invested cash balances due to the decline in interest rates during fiscal 2003 as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and our decision to increase our holdings of higher credit quality yet lower interest bearing investments. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 22% for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 as compared to 25% for fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was primarily the result of the discontinuance of non deductible goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of our adoption of FAS 142. Goodwill was treated as a permanent difference in the fiscal 2002 tax provision, which had the effect of increasing our effective income tax rate. Net Income Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 Net Income $ 570,738 $ 298,281 $ 105,299 Net Income as a % of Net Sales 21.7 % 14.6 % 6.2 % Diluted EPS $ 1.45 $ 0.78 $ 0.28 Fiscal 2004 net income was $571 million, or 21.7% of net sales, and diluted earnings per share was $1.45 compared to net income in fiscal 2003 of $298 million, or 14.6% of net sales, and diluted earnings per share of $0.78. The fiscal 2004 increase in net income of $272 million from the level recorded in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the year to year increase in net sales and, to a lesser extent, the improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales from 18.3% recorded in fiscal 2003 to 26.6% recorded in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2002 net income was $105 million, or 6.2% of net sales. The improvement in net income in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was the result of an increase in net sales, the cessation of goodwill amortization and reduced expenses related to special charges. The impact of inflation on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Related Party Transactions One of our directors, who has been a director since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002. We purchased approximately $337 million, $232 million and $206 million of products from TSMC in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We believe that the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than those that could be 18 Table of Contents obtained from unaffiliated parties. Approximately $15 million and $14 million was payable to TSMC as of October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003, respectively. We anticipate that we will make significant purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 778,045 $ 432,963 $ 226,126 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Net Sales 29.5 % 21.1 % 13.2 % During fiscal 2004, net cash provided by operations increased by $345 million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to the year to year increase in net income of $272 million. During fiscal 2004 we received $124 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs. These cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of approximately $137 million of our common stock, additions to property, plant and equipment of $146 million and our payment of cash dividends of $75 million in fiscal 2004. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased by $568 million during fiscal 2004 to $2,685 million at October 30, 2004. During fiscal 2003, net cash from operations increased by $207 million from the amount recorded in fiscal 2002, primarily due to a year to year increase in net income of $193 million. In fiscal 2003, we received $71 million from our employee stock plans. Cash inflows in fiscal 2003 were offset by additions to property, plant and equipment of $68 million and by a net payment of $1,198 million related to the redemption of all of our outstanding notes together with the associated redemption premium and the termination of the related interest rate swap and loan agreement. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by $781 million during fiscal 2003 to $2,117 million at November 1, 2003 from $2,898 million at November 2, 2002, primarily as a result of these activities. Accounts receivable of $329 million at the end of fiscal 2004 increased by $34 million, or 12%, from $295 million at the end of fiscal 2003. This increase resulted principally from a $75 million increase in net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Accounts receivable of $295 million at the end of fiscal 2003 increased $67 million, or 29%, from $228 million at the end of fiscal 2002. This increase resulted principally from a $102 million increase in net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Days sales outstanding increased from 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 to 48 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. The year to year increase in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2003 was due to a higher level of sales in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Inventories increased by $58 million, or 20%, from the end of fiscal 2003 to $346 million at the end of fiscal 2004. Days cost of sales in inventory increased by 17 days to 123 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The increase in inventory in dollars was the result of an increase in internal production and purchases of fabricated wafers from external foundries in response to the increases in demand for our products, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2004, combined with the impact of a decline in net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the levels recorded in the prior quarter. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 declined 12% from the levels recorded in the prior quarter because incoming order rates from our customers slowed as a result of what we believe is an inventory correction at our customers. Inventories declined by $19 million, or 6%, from the end of fiscal 2002 to $288 million at the end of fiscal 2003. Days cost of sales in inventory declined by 29 days to 106 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The decrease in inventory in dollars was attributable to tight control of inventory levels as well as increasing demand for our products as the fiscal year 2003 progressed. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $146 million in fiscal 2004, $68 million in fiscal 2003 and $57 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year was principally the result of additions to manufacturing capacity at our facilities in response to the increased 19 Table of Contents demand levels for our products we experienced in fiscal 2003 and 2004. Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we redeemed all of our outstanding notes for cash. The redemption price was 101.90% of the principal amount of the notes, or $1,223 million. A net pre tax loss of $0.2 million was recognized in other expense as a result of the redemption, comprised of a $10.8 million gain on the redemption of the notes that was offset by a write off of $11 million of deferred financing costs. The gain on the redemption of the notes was due to the carrying value of the notes being greater than the redemption value as a result of the mark to market of the interest rate component of the notes to fair value. As a result, apart from operating lease obligations, we had no debt outstanding at the end of fiscal year 2003 or fiscal year 2004. During fiscal 2004, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.20 per outstanding share of common stock, which were paid during the fiscal year. These dividend payments amounted in total to approximately $75 million. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on our quarterly financial performance. On August 11, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock. We may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Management will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased approximately $137 million of our common stock under this plan. Our previous repurchase program announced on August 15, 2002 was terminated by resolution of our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004. The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of October 30, 2004: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 42,729 $ 16,177 $ 16,274 $ 6,516 $ 3,762 Software licensesb 35,801 9,375 26,426 Deferred compensation planc 322,304 5,388 3,320 934 312,662 Pension fundingd 5,094 5,094 Total $ 405,928 $ 36,034 $ 46,020 $ 7,450 $ 316,424 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) Software licenses relate to contractual obligations we have to license electronic design automation software from third parties. (c) These payments relate to obligations under the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation and gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23, 1997. The payment obligations reflected in the table include the planned distributions from the Deferred Compensation Plan for participants who have terminated employment prior to October 30, 2004 and elected to have their plan balance distributed in installments. The amount in the More than 5 Years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the Deferred Compensation Plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment or elected to withdraw their balances prior to October 30, 2004. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment or elected to withdraw their balances, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the More than 5 Years column of the table. 20 Table of Contents (d) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2005. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements. The expected timing of payment and amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. At October 30, 2004, our principal source of liquidity was $2,685 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Outlook During fiscal years 2003 and 2004, we experienced the continuation of what we believe is a broad based cyclical improvement in the semiconductor industry that started for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. However, during the third quarter of fiscal 2004, incoming order rates from our customers slowed and order cancellations increased. We believe this is the result of an inventory correction at our customers. The level of incoming order rates remained low through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result, net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 declined 12% from the levels recorded in the prior quarter. Net sales declined in all geographic regions but especially in China and Japan where the effects of the inventory correction and the economic constraints imposed by the Chinese government impacted demand for our products used in wireless handsets, wireless infrastructure, semiconductor capital equipment, in particular automatic test equipment, and to a lesser extent consumer and computer products. We are entering fiscal 2005 with a cautious outlook particularly for the first fiscal quarter of the year. Much of the order rate decline we have experienced appears to be related to inventory adjustments and we believe we have already absorbed significant inventory reductions at our customers. There continues to be much uncertainty about interest rate levels and higher energy prices and their potential impact on consumer spending and, as a result, our customers continue to be cautious. Accordingly, we are entering fiscal 2005 with low levels of backlog, which limits our visibility and makes it very difficult to predict revenue levels for fiscal 2005. Against this background, we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to be in the range of $575 million to $600 million and we expect gross margins to remain at 58% to 59% and operating expenses to decline sequentially by between 3% and 4%. Based on these assumptions we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.31 for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. While our current lack of visibility causes us to be cautious about fiscal 2005, we are planning for demand for our products to recover in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and throughout the fiscal year and for our financial results to reflect this improvement in line with the expected recovery in demand. We currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $150 million in fiscal 2005. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to approximately $160 million in fiscal 2005 from $150 million in fiscal 2004. We anticipate that our effective tax rate will remain relatively flat year to year at approximately 22%. 21 Table of Contents Special Charges Fiscal 2003 Special Charges During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $0.3 million. The charge included a $2.0 million write down of equipment to fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in plastic packages, which had been done internally at our facility in the Philippines. This amount was the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly, net of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets. We also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in the write down of $2.7 million of equipment to its fair value. During the quarter ended August 2, 2003, we determined that costs remaining to be paid for certain restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally recorded. Accordingly, we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring accruals by $4.4 million related to prior restructuring charges as more fully described below. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $9.2 million as a result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in Belfast, Northern Ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical applications. The charge included $2.0 million of severance and fringe benefit costs for approximately 57 manufacturing employees and 14 engineering and administrative employees all of which had been paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The charge also included $6 million related to the write down of property, plant and equipment to its fair value and $1.2 million related to the write down of various other assets to their fair values. The closure was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2002 Special Charges During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $27.2 million. The second quarter charge was comprised of $25.7 million related to the planned transfer of production from our three older four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our three six inch and one eight inch wafer fabrication facilities, and $3 million primarily related to the impairment of an investment, which was partially offset by an adjustment of $1.5 million related to equipment cancelation fees recorded in fiscal year 2001. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. Included in the $25.7 million special charge were severance and fringe benefit costs of $15.3 million for 509 manufacturing employees in the United States and Ireland, $2.3 million related to the write down of equipment to be abandoned and $8.1 million of other charges, primarily related to lease termination and cleanup costs. The write down of equipment was principally due to a decision to discontinue various product development strategies. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we reversed $2.9 million of the accrual primarily due to lower than previously expected severance costs. The lower severance costs were the result of a reduction in the number of separated employees and, to a lesser extent, the average tenure of separated employees differing from estimates. The 509 employees projected to be terminated at the time of the original charge was adjusted down to 439 and, as of May 1, 2004, all of the employees had been terminated. The reduction in the number of employees to be terminated was due to the transfer of employees, which primarily occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, to positions in our six inch wafer fabrication facilities where we experienced an unexpected increase in demand for our products. All the planned closure and consolidation actions related to our four inch wafer fabrication facilities are now complete. Since severance costs are paid as income continuance at some locations, these amounts will be expended over time subsequent to the final termination of employment. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $12.8 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $3.7 million related to cost reduction actions taken in several product groups and, to a lesser extent, in manufacturing, $3.8 million related to the impairment of an investment, $3.4 million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the closing of an Austrian design center acquired in fiscal 2001 and $1.9 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made. The severance and fringe benefit costs were for approximately 70 engineering employees in the United States, 22 Table of Contents Europe and Canada, and approximately 30 manufacturing employees in the United States, all of whom had been terminated as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges of approximately $8.4 million. The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of $2.5 million related to cost reduction actions taken in the sales group, several product groups and our manufacturing test operations for approximately 65 employees in the United States and Europe, all of whom had been terminated as of November 1, 2003. The charges also included $2.1 million related to the impairment of investments, $1.8 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees and a change in estimate of $2.0 million for additional estimated cleanup costs originally recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The investment impairment charges were related to the decline in fair value of a publicly traded equity investment to less than its cost basis that was determined to be other than temporary, and to an equity investment in a private company. The private company equity investment was part of a product strategy that we decided to abandon. Fiscal 2001 Special Charges During fiscal 2001, we recorded special charges of approximately $47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the economic climate at that time. The actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas as well as a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities. The cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of $29.6 million for approximately 1,200 employees in the United States, Europe, Asia and the Philippines, all of whom had been terminated as of January 31, 2004. The special charges also included $11.6 million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations and $5.8 million of other charges primarily related to equipment and lease cancelation fees. Based on the results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order cancelation fees, the amount paid was $1.5 million less than the amount recorded for such charges and, accordingly, we adjusted the provision for purchase order cancelation fees by $1.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 to reflect this change in estimate. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we determined that the severance costs remaining to be paid would be $1.3 million less than the amount originally recorded for these charges and also determined that $0.2 million originally reserved for the termination of two leases would not be required. Therefore, we adjusted the provision for these severance and other costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 to reflect this change in estimate. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and amended it by issuing FIN 46R in December 2003. FIN 46R requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity. Because we do not have any variable interest entities, the adoption of FIN 46R in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 did not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (Revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, which enhanced the required disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, but did not change the measurement or recognition principles for those plans. The statement requires additional interim and annual disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. The required interim disclosures were effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, and the required annual disclosures are included in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10 K. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (SAB 104). SAB 104 updates portions of the interpretive guidance included in Topic 13 of the codification of Staff 23 Table of Contents Accounting Bulletins in order to make the interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations. We are following the guidance of SAB 104. In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments. Additionally, EITF Issue No. 03 1 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF Issue No. 03 1; however, the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for our fiscal year ended October 30, 2004. We will evaluate the effect, if any, of EITF Issue No. 03 1 when final guidance is released. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the 24 Table of Contents preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Goodwill In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted the new rules of FAS 142 for measuring and assessing goodwill for impairment. As required by FAS 142, all remaining and future acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under FAS 142, we utilize the entity wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. FAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At October 30, 2004, we had gross deferred tax assets of $144 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a $33 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In addition, we have provided for potential liabilities due in various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, or FAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with 25 Table of Contents FAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains or incorporates forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and managements beliefs and assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on our behalf. Words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading Factors That May Affect Future Results that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make. We do not intend to update publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Long term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. In certain markets where end user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our backlog. As a result, we are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp fall off of sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet the customers unique requirements so that those canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets. Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new 26 Table of Contents products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. We may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future. Many other companies offer products that compete with our products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. We rely on third party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry standard wafers and assembly/test services, and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test subcontractors and on third party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Additionally, we utilize third party wafer fabricators as sole source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications. We have no written supply agreements with these sole source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders. If these sole source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. We may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and short term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. During these periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to these periods of increased demand. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Our revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase. Should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. 27 Table of Contents We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. We rely primarily upon know how, rather than on patents, to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests. Other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. We are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it. We believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience, innovation and management skill. There also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or reverse engineer our products, or that our confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees. We rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and services. We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in California as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport. In addition, California has 28 Table of Contents experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has been negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for us, without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to economic, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. During fiscal year 2004, approximately 75% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies. Potential interest rate increases, particularly in the United States and China, as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products. We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the United States economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, and additional costs related to tax, tariff and freight rate increases. Our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives. A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributors initiative, could disrupt our current business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted. We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Our annual interest income would change by approximately $19 million in fiscal 2004 and $29 million in fiscal 2003 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at October 30, 2004 would change by approximately $24 million for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at November 1, 2003 would not be significantly 29 Table of Contents impacted by either an increase or decrease in interest rates primarily due to the short term nature of a major portion of our investment portfolio. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to six months. The short term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is against the Euro, primarily because Europe has a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 30 Table of Contents
