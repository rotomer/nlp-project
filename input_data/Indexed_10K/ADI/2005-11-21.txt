ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net Sales $ 2,388,808 $ 2,633,800 $ 2,047,268 Gross Margin % 57.9 % 59.0 % 54.9 % Diluted EPS $ 1.08 $ 1.45 $ 0.78 Net Income $ 414,787 $ 570,738 $ 298,281 Net Income as a % of Sales 17.4 % 21.7 % 14.6 % Revenue declined 9% in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004, primarily as a result of an inventory correction at our customers in the ATE, or automatic test equipment, and wireless handset markets during the fiscal year. Gross margins declined by 110 basis points primarily as a result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production. We recorded special charges of $31 million in accordance with our restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, of which $20 million related to severance costs associated with the closure of our California wafer fabrication facility and $11 million related to severance costs associated with a reorganization of our product development and support programs. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. As a result of this action, we recorded additional income tax expenses of $49 million in fiscal 2005. We generated cash flow from operations of $673 million during fiscal 2005, repurchased $525 million of our common stock and paid $119 million in cash dividends. Our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments balance increased by $21 million during fiscal 2005 to $2,706 million at October 29, 2005. On October 18, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options granted after December 31, 2000 awarded to employees under our stock option plans that had exercise prices of $40.00 or greater. The vesting terms of options issued to corporate officers and directors were not accelerated. Unvested options to purchase approximately 18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration. Because the exercise price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of their modification, no compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The primary purpose for modifying the terms of these options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized non cash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these options as measured under SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, or SFAS 123(R). The approximately $188 million ($134 million net of tax) of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification. We are required to adopt SFAS 123(R) effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and we will be required to record compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of income, rather than in a pro forma footnote to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Net sales declined $245 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. This decline was primarily the result of a 21% decrease in orders for products used in communications applications due to weakness in the wireless handset end markets. Sales to customers in the industrial market decreased 4% as a result of an inventory correction at our customers in the automatic test equipment market in the first half of fiscal 2005. Sales to customers in the computer end market decreased 10% in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by a 12% increase in sales to customers in the consumer end market. 16 Table of Contents For fiscal 2004, net sales increased $587 million, or 29%, from fiscal 2003. This increase in net sales in fiscal 2004 was a result of what we believed was a broad based increase in demand for our products used in every end market we serve. Increased demand for our products used in industrial products and communications products accounted for approximately 80% of this year to year increase, and increased demand for our products used in consumer and computer end markets accounted for the remaining increase in net sales. Increased demand for our products used in wireless handsets and infrastructure was the main reason for our increased sales in the communications end market. Over the last three fiscal years, net sales from analog products were approximately 80% of net sales and sales of DSP products represented approximately 20% of net sales. In fiscal 2005, analog product sales decreased 7% and DSP product sales decreased 18% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2004, analog product sales increased 31% and DSP product sales increased 21% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003. The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2005 2004 2003 North America 25 % 25 % 26 % Europe 23 % 20 % 21 % Japan 19 % 19 % 18 % China 11 % 14 % 11 % Rest of Asia 22 % 22 % 24 % The percentage of our net sales in China as a percentage of our total sales decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and increased in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, primarily as the result of the changes in sales into the wireless handset end markets. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Gross Margin $ 1,382,840 $ 1,553,801 $ 1,124,108 Gross Margin % 57.9 % 59.0 % 54.9 % Gross margin declined in fiscal 2005 by 110 basis points from the gross margin in fiscal 2004. The decline in gross margin was primarily the result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production. Gross margin improved in fiscal 2004 by 410 basis points from the gross margin in fiscal 2003. The improvement in gross margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an increasing sales level and, to a lesser extent, the impact of restructuring actions taken in previous years as well as continued tight cost control at our manufacturing operations. Research and Development Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Research and Development (R&D) Expenses $ 497,097 $ 514,442 $ 452,856 R&D Expenses as a % of Net Sales 20.8 % 19.5 % 22.1 % R&D expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by $17 million, or 3%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004. This decrease was caused by a $9 million reduction in employee bonus expenses and reductions in other expenses of $21 million as a result of our tight control over all other engineering expenses throughout the year. 17 Table of Contents These expense reductions were partially offset by a $13 million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses. R&D expenses increased by $62 million, or 14% in fiscal 2004 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional salary and benefit costs associated with a 5% increase in engineering headcount during the year as well as annual salary increases and increased bonus payments and, to a lesser extent, an increase in other engineering expenses reflecting the increased R&D activity during the year. R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 SMG&A Expenses $ 338,276 $ 340,036 $ 288,009 SMG&A Expenses as a % of Net Sales 14.2 % 12.9 % 14.1 % SMG&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2005 by $2 million or 1% from the levels recorded in 2004. The decrease in SMG&A expenses was caused by a reduction in employee bonus expenses of $4 million and reductions in other SMG&A expenses of $10 million as a result of tight control over all discretionary spending throughout the year. These expense reductions were partially offset by a $12 million increase in salary and employee benefit costs. SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2004 by $52 million, or 18%, from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily the result of increased salary and employee benefit expenses, increased employee bonus expenses, increased commission payments as a result of the 29% year to year increase in net sales and, to a lesser extent, increased legal costs associated with patent and intellectual property activity and other expense increases associated with selling and marketing activities. Special Charges Fiscal 2005 Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $20 million as a result of a decision to close our California wafer fabrication operations and transfer production to facilities located in Massachusetts and Ireland, as well as to third party wafer fabricators. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees. As of October 29, 2005, the employment of none of these employees had been terminated. In addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we expect to incur additional expenses related to this action during fiscal 2006. These additional charges will consist of approximately $22 million of non cash cost of sales expense for additional depreciation due to the shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment, approximately $2.4 million for stay on bonuses and approximately $6 million for estimated lease termination and clean up costs. The closure of these facilities is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2006 and is estimated to result in cost savings of approximately $44 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007. These savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $43 million in cost of sales, of which approximately $7 million relates to non cash depreciation savings, and approximately $1 million in selling, marketing, general and administrative expense. Reorganization of Product Development and Support Programs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $11 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product 18 Table of Contents development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and DSP product programs. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. As of October 29, 2005, the employment of 49 of these employees had been terminated. In addition to this charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we expect to incur approximately $2 million of additional expenses related to this action during fiscal 2006. The additional expenses relate to facilities closure costs and estimated lease termination costs. Most of this action is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and will be fully completed by the end of fiscal 2006. These organizational changes are expected to result in savings of approximately $19 million per year once fully completed by the end of fiscal 2006. These savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $9 million in research and development expense, approximately $6 million in selling, marketing, general and administrative expense and approximately $4 million in cost of sales. Special Charges Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2003 Fourth Quarter Special Charge During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $9.2 million as a result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in Belfast, Northern Ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical applications. The charge included $2.0 million of severance and fringe benefit costs for approximately 57 manufacturing employees and 14 engineering and administrative employees all of which had been paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The charge also included $6 million related to the write down of property, plant and equipment to its fair value and $1.2 million related to the write down of various other assets to their fair values. The closure was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 Third Quarter Special Charge During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a special charge of $0.3 million. The charge included a $2.0 million write down of equipment to fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in plastic packages, which had been done internally at our facility in the Philippines. This amount was the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly, net of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets. We also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in the write down of $2.7 million of equipment to its fair value. During the quarter ended August 2, 2003, we determined that costs remaining to be paid for certain previous restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally recorded, and accordingly, we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring accruals by $4.4 million. Operating Income Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Operating income $ 515,987 $ 699,323 $ 373,709 Operating income as a % of Net Sales 21.6 % 26.6 % 18.3 % The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily a result of a 9% year to year decrease in net sales, a 110 basis point year to year decrease in gross margin combined with a $31 million special charge in fiscal year 2005 partially offset by operating expense decreases. The increase in operating income in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of the 410 basis point year to year improvement in gross margin offset by operating expense increases that were limited to 14%, which was less than half the 29% increase in net sales for the year. 19 Table of Contents Nonoperating Income and Expense Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Interest expense $ 27 $ 224 $ 32,230 Interest income $ (71,688 ) $ (36,047 ) $ (41,195 ) Other (income)/expense, net $ (42 ) $ 2,410 $ 838 The year to year increase in interest income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was attributable to higher interest rates as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board, as well as higher average invested cash balances. The year to year decrease in interest income in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable to lower average invested cash balances in fiscal 2004 due to the note redemption in 2003. This was partially mitigated by our decision in fiscal 2004 to increase our holdings of longer term, high credit quality bonds, which offer higher yields than shorter term investments, and higher interest rates later in fiscal 2004 as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board. Fiscal 2003 included interest expense for our $1,200 million 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes that we redeemed on October 1, 2003. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Provision for Income Taxes $ 172,903 $ 161,998 $ 83,555 Effective Income Tax Rate 29.4 % 22.1 % 21.9 % On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for US multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. As a result of this action, we recorded additional income tax expense of $49 million in fiscal 2005. We had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the 162(m) limitation of the Internal Revenue Code would not withdraw their balances from the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the Deferred Compensation Plan, while they were still subject to the 162(m) limitation, and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal, generally upon their retirement. Due to recent changes in tax law that were enacted as part of the AJCA, the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans have changed. As a result, three executive officers who are currently subject to the 162(m) limitation have either withdrawn, or have indicated their intention to withdraw, a portion of their balances from the Deferred Compensation Plan. We incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of $7.2 million as a result of the write off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our Deferred Compensation Plan. Net Income Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net Income $ 414,787 $ 570,738 $ 298,281 Net Income as a % of Net Sales 17.4 % 21.7 % 14.6 % Diluted EPS $ 1.08 $ 1.45 $ 0.78 Net income decreased by $156 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily the result of the year to year decrease in net sales, a $49 million tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings and $31 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2005. These decreases were partially offset by a $36 million increase in interest income. 20 Table of Contents Net income increased by $272 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. The improvement in net income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the year to year increase in net sales, and, to a lesser extent, the improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales from 18.3% recorded in fiscal 2003 to 26.6% recorded in fiscal 2004. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Related Party Transaction One of our directors, who has been a director since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002. We purchased approximately $224 million, $337 million and $232 million of products from TSMC in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We believe that the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than those that could be obtained from unaffiliated parties. Approximately $27 million and $15 million were payable to TSMC as of October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004, respectively. We anticipate that we will make significant purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 672,704 $ 778,045 $ 432,963 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Net Sales 28.2 % 29.5 % 21.1 % During fiscal 2005, net cash provided by operations decreased by $105 million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to a decline in net income of $156 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $109 million during fiscal 2005. This increase was the result of $673 million of cash flow from operations, $89 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs and $70 million of cash inflows from the net change in our short term available for sale investments. These cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of $525 million of our common stock, the payment of $119 million of cash dividends and additions to property, plant and equipment of $85 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased by $21 million during fiscal 2005 to $2,706 million at October 29, 2005. During fiscal 2004, net cash provided by operations increased by $345 million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to the year to year increase in net income of $272 million. During fiscal 2004, we received $124 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs. These cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of $137 million of our common stock, additions to property, plant and equipment of $146 million and our payment of cash dividends of $75 million in fiscal 2004. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased by $568 million during fiscal 2004 to $2,685 million at October 30, 2004. Fiscal Year 2005 2004 Accounts Receivable $ 320,523 $ 330,183 Days Sales Outstanding 47 48 Inventory $ 325,605 $ 348,407 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory 115 124 Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2005 decreased by $10 million, or 2.9%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2004. This decrease was the result of a lower amount of shipments in the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Inventories decreased by $23 million, or 6.5%, and days cost of sales in inventory declined by 9 days during fiscal 2005. This decrease was the result of our aggressive management of spending related to back end 21 Table of Contents manufacturing and fabricated wafer purchases from external foundries and a modest adjustment of our internal capacity. Recent changes in tax law that were enacted as part of the AJCA, had the effect that distributions from the Deferred Compensation Plan after January 1, 2006 could be subject to more stringent tax laws. As a result, some participants have elected to withdraw, or indicated their intention to withdraw, a portion, or all, of their balance from the Deferred Compensation Plan prior to December 31, 2005. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, $234 million of our non current deferred compensation plan investments and the offsetting liability became current. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $85 million in fiscal 2005, $146 million in fiscal 2004 and $68 million in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $126 million. During fiscal 2005, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.32 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of $119 million in fiscal 2005. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on November 14, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 14, 2005 to shareholders of record on November 25, 2005 and is expected to be approximately $44 million. On May 11, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004 from $500 million to $1 billion. We may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Management will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased approximately $137 million of our common stock under this plan. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased approximately $525 million of our common stock under this plan. Our previous repurchase program announced on August 15, 2002 was terminated by resolution of our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004. The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of October 29, 2005: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 84,313 $ 30,019 $ 42,516 $ 11,371 $ 407 Deferred compensation planb 277,317 234,376 1,992 992 39,957 Pension fundingc 6,536 6,536 Total $ 368,166 $ 270,931 $ 44,508 $ 12,363 $ 40,364 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These payments relate to obligations under our Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23, 1997. The payment obligations reflected in the table include the planned distributions from the Deferred Compensation Plan for the portion of the investments that participants have indicated their intention, prior to October 29, 2005, to have distributed from the Deferred Compensation Plan within a year. The amount in the More than 5 Years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the Deferred Compensation Plan to be paid to participants who, prior to October 29, 2005, have not terminated employment or indicated their intention to withdraw their balances. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment or indicated their 22 Table of Contents intention to withdraw their balances, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the More than 5 Years column of the table. (c) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2006. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements. The expected timing of payment and amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. At October 29, 2005, our principal source of liquidity was $2,706 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Off balance Sheet Financing As of October 29, 2005, we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. Tentative Settlement of the SECs Previously Announced Stock Option Investigation In our Form 10 K filing dated November 30, 2004, we disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had initiated an inquiry into our stock option granting practices, focusing on options that were granted shortly before the issuance of favorable financial results. On November 15, 2005, we announced that a tentative settlement has been reached. Since receiving notice of this inquiry, we have been cooperating with the SEC and believe that the matter will be concluded in the near future. We and our President and CEO, Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, have made an offer of settlement to the Staff of the SEC, which is subject to agreement regarding the specific language of the SECs administrative order and other settlement documents. The SEC Staff has decided to recommend the offer of settlement to the Commission. A final settlement is subject to review and approval by the Commission. Our Board of Directors and Mr. Fishman, believe that it is in the best interests of our shareholders to settle this case on the proposed terms rather than face a protracted dispute with the SEC. The contemplated settlement addresses two separate issues. The first issue concerns our disclosure regarding grants of options to our employees and directors prior to the release of favorable financial results. Specifically, the issue relates to options granted to our employees (including officers) on November 30, 1999 and to employees (including officers) and directors on November 10, 2000. The SEC settlement would conclude that we should have made disclosures in our proxy filings to the effect that we priced these stock options prior to releasing favorable financial results. The second issue addressed by the tentative settlement concerns the grant dates for options granted to our employees (including officers) in 1998 and 1999, and the grant date for options granted to employees (including officers) and directors in 2001. Specifically, the settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for the September 4, 1998 options should have been September 8th (which is one trading day later than the date that was used to price the options); the appropriate grant date for the November 30, 1999 23 Table of Contents options should have been November 29th (which is one trading day earlier than the date that was used); and the appropriate grant date for the July 18, 2001 options should have been July 26th (which is five trading days after the original date). In connection with the contemplated settlement, we would consent to a cease and desist order under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b 5 thereunder, would pay a civil money penalty of $3 million, and would reprice options granted to Mr. Fishman and other directors in certain years. Options granted to all other employees would be excluded from the repricing. Mr. Fishman would consent to a cease and desist order under Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, would pay a civil money penalty of $1 million, and would make a disgorgement payment with respect to options granted in certain years. With the exception of options granted in 1998, Mr. Fishman has not exercised or sold any of the options identified in this matter. We and Mr. Fishman would settle this matter without admitting or denying the Commissions findings. We have determined that no restatement of our historical financial results would be necessary due to the proposed settlement, because the effects of using revised measurement dates for options granted in 1998, 1999 and 2001 are not material to any of the fiscal years 1998 through 2005, based on the materiality guidelines contained in SAB 99. If a stock based compensation charge had been taken as a result of the revised measurement dates for these option grants to all employees (including officers) and directors, our net income for fiscal years 1998 through 2005 would have been reduced by $21.8 million in total. During this period, we earned cumulative net income of over $2.5 billion. There would be no impact on revenue, cash flow from operations, or shareholders equity as a result of using the revised measurement dates. The impact on net income in individual fiscal years would have been as follows: fiscal 1998 ($0.2 million), fiscal 1999 ($1.4 million), fiscal 2000 ($1.8 million), fiscal 2001 ($3.7 million), fiscal 2002 ($8.1 million), fiscal 2003 ($6.1 million), fiscal 2004 ($0.5 million). Outlook We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 to be similar to the levels recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. With the adoption of SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we estimate that stock based compensation expense will have an impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Including this stock based compensation expense we expect diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.31 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154) which supersedes APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change. However, the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively. Therefore, the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this Statement. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Asset Retirements In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. FIN 47 clarifies that the term 24 Table of Contents conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. We are currently analyzing FIN 47 and believe the adoption of FIN 47 will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonmonetary Assets In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, (SFAS 153). SFAS 153 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS 153 eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2005 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Inventory Costs In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 151 and do not believe that its adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Stock Based Compensation On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods. The modified prospective method recognizes compensation cost beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. The modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate their historical financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) for all prior periods presented or (b) for prior interim periods of the year of adoption. As permitted by SFAS 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have a significant impact on our results of 25 Table of Contents operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. SFAS 123(R) is required to be adopted effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We adopted SFAS 123(R) in fiscal year 2006 on October 30, 2005 using the modified prospective method. We estimate that expense related to share based payments to employees will have an impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their 26 Table of Contents estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS 142, goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under SFAS 142, we utilize the entity wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At October 29, 2005, we had gross deferred tax assets of $142 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a $42 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In addition, we have provided for potential liabilities due in various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, or SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. 27 Table of Contents See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains or incorporates forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and managements beliefs and assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on our behalf. Words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading Factors That May Affect Future Results that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make. We do not intend to update publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Long term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. In certain markets where end user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our backlog. As a result, we are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp fall off of sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet the customers unique requirements so that those canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets. Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet 28 Table of Contents the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. We may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future. Many other companies offer products that compete with our products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. We rely on third party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry standard wafers and assembly/test services, and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test subcontractors and on third party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Additionally, we utilize third party wafer fabricators as sole source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications. We have no written supply agreements with these sole source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders. If these sole source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. We may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and short term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. During these periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to these periods of increased demand. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Our revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity. We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase. Should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. We rely primarily upon know how, rather than on patents, to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse 29 Table of Contents engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests. Other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. We are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties. There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it. We believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience, innovation and management skill. There also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or reverse engineer our products, or that our confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees. We rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and services. We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in California as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 30 Table of Contents We are exposed to economic, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations. During fiscal year 2005, approximately 75% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies. Potential interest rate increases, particularly in the United States and China, as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products. We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the United States economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, and additional costs related to tax, tariff and freight rate increases. Our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives. A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributors initiative, could disrupt our current business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted. We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Our annual interest income would change by approximately $16 million in fiscal 2005 and $19 million in fiscal 2004 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004 would change by approximately $14 million and $24 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to six months. The short term nature of these 31 Table of Contents contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is against the Euro, primarily because our European operations have a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 32 Table of Contents
