Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net Sales $ 2,573,176 $ 2,388,808 $ 2,633,800 Gross Margin % 58.5 % 57.9 % 59.0 % Net Income $ 549,482 $ 414,787 $ 570,738 Net Income as a % of Net Sales 21.4 % 17.4 % 21.7 % Diluted EPS $ 1.48 $ 1.08 $ 1.45 Net sales increased $184.4 million, or 8% in fiscal 2006, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2005. The increase in net sales in fiscal 2006 was offset by the impact of a $41 million decrease in sales in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 as a result of the loss of sales from our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Net sales declined $245 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. Revenue Trends by End Market The categorization of sales by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time and when 23 Table of Contents this occurs we reclassify sales by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing, or the underlying trends of results within each end market. Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Industrial $ 1,083,602 $ 939,020 $ 950,659 % Total sales 42 % 39 % 36 % Y Y 15 % (1 )% 32 % Computer $ 298,844 $ 332,062 $ 374,362 % Total sales 12 % 14 % 14 % Y Y (10 )% (11 )% 14 % Communications $ 748,176 $ 735,743 $ 959,872 % Total sales 29 % 31 % 37 % Y Y 2 % (23 )% 30 % Consumer $ 442,554 $ 381,983 $ 348,907 % Total sales 17 % 16 % 13 % Y Y 16 % 9 % 34 % Total ADI $ 2,573,176 $ 2,388,808 $ 2,633,800 % Total sales 100 % 100 % 100 % Y Y 8 % (9 )% 29 % Industrial Revenue from products sold into the industrial end market (which includes factory automation, scientific and medical instrumentation, semiconductor automatic test equipment (ATE), defense electronics and automotive applications) increased 15% in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase reflects a broad based increase in demand for our products across a wide range of customers in this end market. The industrial end market represented approximately 42% of our total revenue in fiscal 2006. Sales to customers in the industrial end market decreased 1% from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 as a result of a decline in revenues from our customers in the automatic test equipment market in the first half of fiscal 2005. The industrial end market represented approximately 39% and 36% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Computer Revenue from products sold into the computer end market declined 10% in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The decline was primarily the result of refocusing our power management portfolio, lower sales of our personal computer audio codecs and an overall slow down in the personal computer market. The computer end market represented approximately 12% of our total revenue in fiscal 2006. Revenue from products sold into the computer end market decreased 11% in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The computer end market represented approximately 14% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004. Communications Revenue from products sold into the communications end market increased 2% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 as a result of an increase in sales of our products used in basestations. These increases were offset by decreases in wireless handset revenue and decreases in sales to networking customers. The sales decline attributable to networking customers was approximately $41 million and was the result of the loss of sales from our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line, which we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The communications end market represented approximately 29% of our total revenue in fiscal 2006. Revenue from products sold into the communications end market declined 23% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. The decline was primarily the result of a significant decline in revenues from wireless handset customers in fiscal 2005. The communications end market represented approximately 31% and 37% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Consumer Revenue from products sold into the consumer end market increased 16% in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily the result of the success of our products in digital home applications and to a lesser extent in digital cameras and a broad array of audio and video applications. The consumer end market represented approximately 17% of our total revenue in fiscal 2006. Revenue from sales in the consumer end market increased 9% in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The consumer end market represented approximately 16% and 13% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. 24 Table of Contents Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes sales trends by product categories showing what proportion of our total sales are represented by each product category as well as the annual sequential growth rates for each product category. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing, or the underlying trends of results within each product category. Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Converters $ 1,023,499 $ 927,720 $ 884,421 % Total sales 40 % 39 % 33 % Y Y 10 % 5 % 33 % Amplifiers $ 532,050 $ 445,734 $ 467,223 % Total sales 21 % 19 % 18 % Y Y 19 % (5 )% 26 % Power management & reference $ 219,651 $ 214,160 $ 264,205 % Total sales 8 % 9 % 10 % Y Y 3 % (19 )% 9 % Other analog $ 301,633 $ 242,805 $ 285,588 % Total sales 12 % 10 % 11 % Y Y 24 % (15 )% 47 % Total analog products $ 2,076,833 $ 1,830,419 $ 1,901,437 % Total sales 81 % 77 % 72 % Y Y 13 % (4 )% 29 % General purpose DSP $ 205,483 $ 186,660 $ 175,302 % Total sales 8 % 8 % 7 % Y Y 10 % 6 % 10 % DSP based DSL ASIC and Network Processor Product Line* $ 14,500 $ 54,896 $ 56,118 % Total sales 1 % 2 % 2 % Y Y (74 )% (2 )% (13 )% Wireless Chipsets $ 238,698 $ 266,586 $ 432,638 % Total sales 9 % 11 % 16 % Y Y (10 )% (38 )% 56 % Other DSP $ 37,662 $ 50,247 $ 68,305 % Total sales 1 % 2 % 3 % Y Y (25 )% (26 )% (10 )% Total DSP products $ 496,343 $ 558,389 $ 732,363 % Total sales 19 % 23 % 28 % Y Y (11 )% (24 )% 27 % Total sales $ 2,573,176 $ 2,388,808 $ 2,633,800 Y Y 8 % (9 )% 29 % * We sold our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. 25 Table of Contents The sharp reduction in sales of DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor products was a result of our decision to sell this product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The wireless handset chipset sales are characterized by high sales volumes in periods of significant growth followed by periods of sales declines as demand for our product declines or shifts to our competition. Revenue Trends by Geographic Region The percentage of sales by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2006 2005 2004 North America 25 % 25 % 25 % Europe 22 % 23 % 20 % Japan 19 % 19 % 19 % China 13 % 11 % 14 % Rest of Asia 21 % 22 % 22 % There was no major shift in the distribution of revenue by geographic region in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The percentage of our net sales in China as a percentage of our total sales decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily as the result of the changes in sales into the wireless handset end markets. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Gross Margin $ 1,506,140 $ 1,382,840 $ 1,553,801 Gross Margin % 58.5 % 57.9 % 59.0 % The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily related to the increase in utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities and increased sales of higher margin products during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. These increases were partially offset by stock based compensation expense and restructuring related expenses, primarily accelerated depreciation of $18.3 million, included in cost of sales during fiscal 2006. Gross margin included an aggregate $30.3 million of stock based compensation expense, restructuring related and acquisition related expenses in fiscal 2006. Gross margin declined in fiscal 2005 by 110 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2004. The decline in gross margin was primarily the result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production in fiscal 2005. Stock based Compensation Expense During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, on October 30, 2005, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective application method. Compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of the options as calculated using the Black Scholes valuation model. The Black Scholes valuation model requires us to make several assumptions. One of the key assumptions is expected volatility. For options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used historical volatility to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options. We changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility. This change was the result of a thorough review we undertook which included consultations with several third party advisors. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the markets current expectations of future volatility. Historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time during which our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines. We believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior. 26 Table of Contents As a result of adopting SFAS 123R on October 30, 2005, the Companys income before income taxes and net income for fiscal 2006, are $73.9 million and $52.6 million lower, respectively, than if it had continued to account for share based compensation under APB Opinion 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended October 28, 2006 are $0.15 and $0.14 lower, respectively, than if the Company had continued to account for share based compensation under APB Opinion 25. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for share based payments to employees under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, using the intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options. The adoption of SFAS 123R under the modified prospective application method allowed us to recognize compensation cost beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirement of SFAS 123R for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. Under the modified prospective application method, prior periods are not restated for the effect of SFAS 123R. We used the graded attribution method to recognize expense for all options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R on October 30, 2005, we switched to the straight line attribution method to recognize expense for all grants made after October 29, 2005. The expense associated with the unvested portion of the pre adoption grants will continue to be expensed using the graded attribution method. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, on October 18, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded to employees after December 31, 2000 that had exercise prices of $40.00 per share or greater. Options issued to our corporate officers and directors were not accelerated. Unvested options to purchase approximately 18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration. Because the exercise price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of the modification, no stock based compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25. The primary purpose for modifying the terms of these out of the money stock options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized non cash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these stock options as measured under SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, because the approximately $188 million ($134 million net of tax) of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification. As of October 28, 2006, the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately $156.6 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our adoption of SFAS 123R. Research and Development (R&D) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 R&D Expenses $ 536,747 $ 497,097 $ 514,442 R&D Expenses as a % of Net Sales 20.9 % 20.8 % 19.5 % R&D expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by $39.7 million, or 8%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2005. The increase in R&D expense was primarily the result of recognizing $33.0 million of stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123R and an increase in employee bonus expense. These increases were partially offset by the savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. R&D expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by $17 million, or 3%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004. The decrease in R&D expenses was caused by a $9 million reduction in employee bonus expenses and reductions in other expenses of $21 million as a result of our tight control over all other engineering expenses throughout the year. These expense reductions were partially offset by a $13 million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses. 27 Table of Contents R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 SMG&A Expenses $ 394,086 $ 338,276 $ 340,036 SMG&A Expenses as a % of Net Sales 15.3 % 14.2 % 12.9 % SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2006 increased $55.8 million, or 16%, from the levels recorded in fiscal 2005. The increase in SMG&A expenses was primarily the result of recording $33.2 million of stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and higher employee salary, employee benefit and employee bonus expenses. These increases were partially offset by savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by $2 million, or 1%, from the levels recorded in 2004. The decrease in SMG&A expenses was caused by a reduction in employee bonus expenses of $4 million and reductions in other SMG&A expenses of $10 million as a result of tight control over all discretionary spending throughout the year. These expense reductions were partially offset by a $12 million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses. Purchased In process Research and Development Fiscal Year 2006 TTPCom Limited $ 5,500 Integrant 11,124 AudioAsics 5,087 Total Purchased in Process R&D $ 21,711 We incurred charges totaling $21.7 million for the write off of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility associated with our acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006. There were no charges for the write off of in process research and development in fiscal 2005 or 2004. See Acquisitions below for additional information regarding these acquisitions. Special Charges Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2006 Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $20.3 million as a result of a decision to close our California wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility located in Wilmington, Massachusetts. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, or SFAS 88, under our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees. The severance benefit was calculated based on length of past service, and employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. As of October 28, 2006, 72 of these employees remained employed at our company. The employment of 42 of these employees was terminated on November 9, 2006. The remaining 30 employees will continue working over the next three months on the cleanup and closure of this wafer fabrication facility. 28 Table of Contents In addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006, which consisted of $18.3 million of non cash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and $2.0 million for stay on bonuses. We reversed approximately $2.0 million of our severance accrual during fiscal 2006. The accrual reversal was required because some employees voluntarily left the company, other employees found alternative employment within the company, and there was an over accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments, normally paid as income continuance, were paid as lump sum payments, which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments. We ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on November 9, 2006. We expect to incur additional expenses related to this action in the first half of fiscal 2007 of approximately $12 million for lease termination, clean up and closure costs. In accordance with SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, the lease charge will be taken when we cease using the building and the cleanup and closure costs will be expensed as incurred. The closure of this facility is estimated to result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007. These annual savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $49 million in cost of sales, of which approximately $7 million relates to non cash depreciation savings, and approximately $1 million in SMG&A expenses. Reorganization of Product Development and Support Programs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $11.2 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and DSP product programs. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. These employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. As of October 28, 2006, 23 of these employees were still employed by the company. During fiscal 2006, we recorded an additional special charge of $3.8 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write off of property, plant and equipment and other items. The remaining $2.3 million relates to the severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 46 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. These employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. As of October 28, 2006, 35 of these employees were still employed by the company. We do not expect to incur any further material charges related to this reorganization action. These organizational changes are expected to result in savings of approximately $25 million per year once fully completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007. These savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $14 million in R&D expenses, approximately $8 million in SMG&A expenses and approximately $3 million in cost of sales. A portion of these savings associated with the charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 have already been realized during the second half of fiscal 2006. Operating Income Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Operating income $ 551,806 $ 515,987 $ 699,323 Operating income as a % of Net Sales 21.4 % 21.6 % 26.6 % The $35.8 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of an 8% increase in net sales and a 60 basis point increase in gross margin percentage. These increases were partially offset by $73.9 million of stock based operating expenses associated with the adoption of SFAS 123R and the $21.7 million write off of purchased in process research and development from our recent acquisitions. The special charges in fiscal 2006 were lower by $29.7 million from the special charges recorded in fiscal 2005. 29 Table of Contents The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily a result of a 9% decrease in net sales, a 110 basis point decrease in gross margin combined with a $31.5 million special charge in fiscal year 2005 partially offset by a decrease in operating expense. Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Interest expense $ 52 $ 27 $ 224 Interest income (100,169 ) (71,688 ) (36,047 ) Other (income)/expense, net (10,472 ) (42 ) 2,410 Total nonoperating income $ (110,589 ) $ (71,703 ) $ (33,413 ) Nonoperating income increased by $38.9 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily the result of higher interest income, which was primarily attributable to higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Non operating income for fiscal 2006 also included a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The year to year increase in interest income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to higher interest rates as well as higher average invested cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Provision for Income Taxes $ 113,661 $ 172,903 $ 161,998 Effective Income Tax Rate 17.2 % 29.4 % 22.1 % Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. The tax rate was lower in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the recording of tax benefits of $35.2 million associated with the completion of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination during fiscal 2006, including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit. In addition, the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal 2005 as a result of our repatriation of foreign earnings and the write off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our deferred compensation plan as more fully described below. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for US multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. As a result of this action, we recorded additional income tax expense of $49 million in fiscal 2005. We had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the 162(m) limitation of the Internal Revenue Code would not withdraw their balances from the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the deferred compensation plan, while they were still subject to the 162(m) limitation, and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal, generally upon their retirement. Due to changes in tax law during 2005 that were enacted as part of the AJCA, the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans have changed. As a result, in fiscal 2005 three executive officers who were subject to the 162(m) limitation withdrew, or indicated their intention to withdraw a portion of their balances from the deferred compensation plan. We incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of $7.2 million as a result of the write off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in the deferred compensation plan. 30 Table of Contents Net Income Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net Income $ 549,482 $ 414,787 $ 570,738 Net Income as a % of Net Sales 21.4 % 17.4 % 21.7 % Diluted EPS $ 1.48 $ 1.08 $ 1.45 Net income increased by $134.7 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily as the result of the 8% increase in net sales, the improvement in gross margin percentage, the increase in nonoperating income and lower tax expense. This increase in net income was partially offset by a year to year increase in operating expenses of $87.5 million, primarily as a result of $66.2 million of stock based operating expenses related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and $23.1 million of operating expenses related to the our acquisitions during fiscal 2006. These operating expense increases were partially offset by a $29.7 million decrease in special charges in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Net income decreased by $156 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily the result of the year to year decrease in net sales, a $49 million tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings and $31 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net income was partially offset by a $36 million increase in interest income. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Acquisitions In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets associated with the support and customization of TTPComs GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future generations of SoftFone(R) baseband processors. We also acquired development rights for AJAR, TTPComs advanced applications platform. As a result of this transaction, we are the single point of contact for both hardware and software support for our new and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving our abilities to service the needs of individual customers. We paid $11.9 million in initial cash payments and may become obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $12 million based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from May 2006 through November 2006. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The estimated fair values of the assets exceeded the initial payments by $7.8 million, resulting in negative goodwill. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No 141, Business Combinations, we recorded a liability for the contingent consideration that will be accounted for as additional purchase price, up to the amount of the negative goodwill. As contingent payments become due, the payments will be applied against the contingent liability. Contingent payments in excess of $7.8 million, if any, will be recorded as additional purchase price. As of October 28, 2006, we had paid $6 million of contingent payments, and the remaining contingent liability was $1.8 million. The purchase price included $5.5 million of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The in process technology related to software code developed for use in our semiconductor chipsets manufactured for devices that use both the 2G and 2.5G cellular wireless technology standards. The fair value of the in process technology was determined by a third party using the income forecast method, which is a discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in process technology was approximately 56% complete. As of October 28, 2006, the in process research and development projects are on schedule. We expect to complete these projects in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and incur an additional $1.3 million of expense related to these projects. The acquisition also included $13.2 million of intangible assets that will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market as well as strengthened our presence in the Asian region. We paid $127.2 million in initial cash payments at closing 31 Table of Contents and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $33 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The initial cash payments include $4.2 million held in escrow for the purchase of the remaining non founder outstanding shares. The preliminary purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We expect to complete the purchase accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 upon obtaining certain additional information. The $33 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $25 million for the achievement of revenue based milestones that may be payable during the period from July 2006 through December 2007 and $8 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. The additional cash payments, if any, will be recorded as additional purchase price. The purchase price included $11.1 million of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in process technology related to technologies currently in development for Dual DAB, T DMB, DVB H, RFID and WiBro applications. The fair value of the in process technology was determined by a third party using the income forecast method, which is a discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in process technology was approximately 74% complete. As of October 28, 2006, the in process research and development projects are on schedule. We expect to complete the projects in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and incur an additional $3.3 million of expense related to these projects. The acquisition also included $21.6 million of intangible assets that will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing our low power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid $19.3 million in initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $8 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The $8 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $4.8 million for the achievement of revenue based milestones that may be payable during the period from October 2006 through January 2009 and $3.2 million based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009. In order to be entitled to receive $2.4 million of the revenue based contingent consideration, certain key employees must continue to be employed by us. As such, that portion of the revenue based contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense when, and if, it is earned. The technological milestones require post acquisition services to be rendered in order to be achieved and, as such, will be recorded as compensation expense when earned. The purchase price included $5.1 million of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in process technology related to technologies currently in development for analog and digital microphone pre amplifiers. The fair value of the in process technology was determined by a third party using the income forecast method, which is a discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in process technology was approximately 69% complete. As of October 28, 2006, the in process research and development projects are on schedule. We expect to complete the projects by April 2007 and incur an additional $1.0 million of expense related to these projects. The acquisition also included $8.3 million of intangible assets that will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. Pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and AudioAsics have not been provided herein as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. The results of operations of each acquisition are included in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. Related Party Transaction One of our directors, who has served on our Board of Directors since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002 and continues to serve as a director of TSMC. Management believes the terms and prices for the purchases of products from TSMC are not affected by the presence of one of our directors on the Board of Directors of TSMC. We purchased approximately $281 million, $224 million and $337 million of products from TSMC in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 32 Table of Contents Approximately $17 million and $27 million were payable to TSMC as of October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005, respectively. We anticipate that we will make significant purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 621,102 $ 672,704 $ 778,045 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Net Sales 24.1 % 28.2 % 29.5 % At October 28, 2006, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $2,128 million, a decrease of $577.6 million from fiscal 2005. Our statement of cash flows reflects the impact of $181.2 million for allocating the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options over a period of several years between the financing and operating section of the statement of cash flows, as required by SFAS 123R. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2006 were net cash generated from operating activities of $621.1 million (which is net of the $181.2 million of non cash excess tax benefit discussed above), $305.6 million of cash inflows from the net change in our short term available for sale investments, proceeds from the sale of a product line of $23.1 million and proceeds of $94.4 million from our various employee stock plans. The principal uses of funds during fiscal 2006 were the repurchase of approximately 30.7 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $1,025 million, cash dividend payments of $201.5 million, payments of $157.0 million for acquisitions and capital expenditures of $129.3 million. During fiscal 2005, net cash provided by operations decreased by $105 million from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004 primarily due to a decline in net income of $156 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $109 million during fiscal 2005. This increase was the result of $673 million of cash flow from operations, $89 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs and $70 million of cash inflows from the net change in our short term available for sale investments. These cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of $525 million of our common stock, the payment of $119 million of cash dividends and additions to property, plant and equipment of $85 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased by $21 million during fiscal 2005 to $2,706 million at October 29, 2005. Fiscal Year 2006 2005 Accounts Receivable $ 329,393 $ 320,523 Days Sales Outstanding 47 47 Inventory $ 378,651 $ 325,605 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory 128 115 Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by $8.9 million, or 3%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2005. This increase was the result of higher sales in the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Inventories at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by $53.0 million, or 16%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2005 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by 13 days from the amount at the end of fiscal 2005. Approximately $19.0 million of this increase relates to the inventory that was built in preparation for the planned closure of our wafer fabrication facility in California and approximately $3.7 million relates to the capitalization of manufacturing related stock based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The remainder of the increase primarily relates to increased inventory to support anticipated higher sales demand. Current liabilities decreased to $490.9 million at October 28, 2006, a decrease of $328.0 million, or 40%, from $818.9 million at the end of fiscal 2005. The decrease in current liabilities was largely the result of a $233.3 million net decrease in the current portion of the deferred compensation plan liability, primarily as a result of withdrawals by plan participants in response to certain provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act, as more fully described below. Additionally, income taxes payable at October 28, 2006 decreased by a net of $111.3 million compared to the end of fiscal 2005, which was primarily as a result of recording tax deductions in 2006 for stock options exercised 33 Table of Contents over a period of several years becoming available upon the completion of the IRS examination. These decreases were partially offset by a $27.7 million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors due to the increase in inventory held by our distributors as a result of increases in demand for our products during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006, we distributed $254.1 million from our amended and restated deferred compensation plan, or the Deferred Compensation Plan, as a result of participant terminations or at the direction of the participants. This amount represented compensation and or stock option gains previously deferred by those participants pursuant to the terms of our Deferred Compensation Plan and earnings on those deferred amounts. As a result of certain provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act, participants had the opportunity until December 31, 2005 to elect to withdraw amounts previously deferred. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $129.3 million in fiscal 2006, $85.5 million in fiscal 2005 and $146.2 million in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $175 million. During fiscal 2006, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.56 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of $201.5 million in fiscal 2006. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on November 13, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 13, 2006 to shareholders of record on November 24, 2006 and is expected to total approximately $54 million. On May 11, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004 from $500 million to $1 billion. On March 14, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion of our common stock, increasing the total amount of our common stock we can repurchase from $1 billion to $2 billion of our common stock. Under the repurchase program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased approximately $1,025 million of our common stock under this plan. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased approximately $525.5 million of our common stock under this program. As of October 28, 2006, we had $312.4 million of authorization remaining under our repurchase program. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 28, 2006: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 83,634 $ 30,311 $ 39,777 $ 8,570 $ 4,976 Deferred compensation planb 31,742 1,109 2,204 28,429 Pension fundingc 7,497 7,497 Total $ 122,873 $ 38,917 $ 41,981 $ 8,570 $ 33,405 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23, 1997. The amount in the More than 5 Years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the More than 5 Years column of the table. All other columns represent installment payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are on long term disability. 34 Table of Contents (c) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2007. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements. The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. At October 28, 2006, our principal source of liquidity was $2,128 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Off balance Sheet Financing As of October 28, 2006, we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. These statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook made by the Company. Product sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 are planned to be approximately $635 to $670 million. This includes an additional week of operations as the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will have a total of 14 weeks. In addition, revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will include a $35 million one time, non recurring payment received by us on November 9, 2006 in exchange for licensing certain intellectual property rights to a third party. Total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 is expected to range from $670 to $705 million. Gross margin percentage is planned to be approximately 61.2% to 61.6% of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 which includes the impact of the $35 million one time payment that has no cost of sales associated with it. Diluted EPS is planned to be approximately $0.36 to $0.42 for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting for Prior Year Misstatements In September 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). This SAB provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the companys balance sheet and statement of operations financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures. The SAB permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after November 15, 2006 by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings. Additionally, the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected 35 Table of Contents through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SAB 108 may have on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur. It also requires the measurement date of plan assets and obligations to occur at the end of the employers fiscal year. SFAS 158 is effective for us at the end of fiscal 2007, except for the change in measurement date, which is effective for us in fiscal 2008. The effect on our financial statements is dependent upon the discount rate at our fiscal 2007 measurement date (September 30, 2007) and actual returns on our pension plan assets during the year. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 158 may have on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that FIN 48 may have on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154) which supersedes APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change. However, the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively. Therefore, the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 154 during fiscal 2006 did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Asset Retirements In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective no 36 Table of Contents later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Inventory Costs In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 151 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future 37 Table of Contents periods. Evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under SFAS 142, we utilize the entity wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At October 28, 2006, we had gross deferred tax assets of $188.4 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a $42.6 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Stock Based Compensation The adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 requires that stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income, rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements. Determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant date fair values using the Black Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third party estimates, when estimating volatility. For options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used historical volatility to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options. We changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility. This change was the result of a thorough review we undertook which 38 Table of Contents included consultations with several third party advisors. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the markets expectations of future volatility. Historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time that our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines. We believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior. Options in our stock are actively traded on several exchanges. Implied volatility is calculated for the period that is commensurate with the options expected term assumption. Because this term often exceeds the period for which there are exchange traded options in our stock, statistical techniques are used to derive the implied volatility for traded options with terms commensurate with the options expected term of five years. This calculation of implied volatility is derived from the closing prices of the Companys stock and exchange traded options from the most recent five trading days prior to the grant date of the employee stock option. In general, the higher the expected volatility used in the Black Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant date fair value of the option. Expected term We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black Scholes grant date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant date fair value of the option. Risk free interest rate The yield on zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate. Expected dividend yield Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarters cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. We currently expect, based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, that approximately 84% of our options will vest, and therefore have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 3.4% to all unvested options as of October 28, 2006. The 3.4% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period, therefore, the cumulative amount, on a compounded basis, that is expected to be forfeited is approximately 16% of the aggregate options granted. This analysis will be re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for information regarding our commitments and contingencies. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Our annual interest income would change by approximately $16 million in fiscal 2006 and $16 million in fiscal 2005 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005 would change by approximately $6 million and $14 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. The short term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 28, 2006, and October 29, 2005, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 40 Table of Contents
