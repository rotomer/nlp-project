ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including in particular the section entitled Outlook contains forward looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, continues, may, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10 K. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason. In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. We have reflected the financial results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income for all years presented. The assets and liabilities of this business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006. Unless otherwise noted, this Managements Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations. Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Total Revenue $ 2,546,117 $ 2,342,919 $ 2,134,800 Gross Margin % 59.7 % 59.9 % 60.0 % Net income from Continuing Operations $ 500,695 $ 516,314 $ 375,944 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 19.7 % 22.0 % 17.6 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 1.51 $ 1.39 $ 0.98 Diluted EPS $ 1.50 $ 1.48 $ 1.08 The year to year revenue changes by end market and product category is more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product. Revenue Trends by End Market The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 24 Table of Contents 2007 2006 2005 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Industrial $ 1,184,891 47 % 7 % $ 1,105,261 47 % $ 952,662 45 % Communications 545,792 22 % 7 % 510,137 22 % 475,284 22 % Consumer 544,415 22 % 23 % 441,871 19 % 380,160 18 % Computer 236,019 9 % (17 )% 285,650 12 % 326,694 15 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,511,117 100 % 7 % $ 2,342,919 100 % $ 2,134,800 100 % Revenue from one time IP license 35,000 Total Revenue $ 2,546,117 $ 2,342,919 $ 2,134,800 Industrial The year to year increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the automotive area and to a lesser extent the instrumentation portion of the industrial end market. These sales increases were partially offset by a decline in sales to automatic test equipment customers. The year to year increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was a result of a broad based increase in demand for our products across a wide range of customers in this end market. Communications The year to year increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was the result of an increase in sales to customers in the wireless basestation and analog wireless handset end markets. The increase in sales in these end markets was partially offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers. The year to year increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was the result of an increase in sales of our products sold to customers in the wireless basestation end market and to a lesser extent, an increase in sales of our products sold into optical applications. These increases were offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers as a result of the sale of our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line, which we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Consumer The year to year increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of increased sales of our products used in video game applications, advanced television systems and digital home applications. The year to year increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of the success of our products in digital home applications and advanced television systems and to a lesser extent in a broad array of audio and video applications. Computer The year to year decreases in each of the last two fiscal years was the result of our decision to deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop computers. Revenue from One Time IP License During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded revenue of $35 million received in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between 25 Table of Contents product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2007 2006 2005 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Converters $ 1,106,615 44 % 8 % $ 1,023,499 44 % $ 927,711 43 % Amplifiers 557,515 22 % 5 % 532,046 23 % 445,732 21 % Power management reference 205,497 8 % (6 )% 219,651 9 % 214,169 10 % Other analog 393,724 16 % 27 % 310,075 13 % 255,385 12 % Total analog products $ 2,263,351 90 % 9 % $ 2,085,271 89 % $ 1,842,997 86 % General purpose DSP 214,000 9 % 4 % 205,483 9 % 186,660 9 % Other DSP 33,766 1 % (35 )% 52,165 2 % 105,143 5 % Total DSP products $ 247,766 10 % (4 %) $ 257,648 11 % $ 291,803 14 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,511,117 100 % 7 % $ 2,342,919 100 % $ 2,134,800 100 % Revenue from one time IP license 35,000 Total Revenue $ 2,546,117 $ 2,342,919 $ 2,134,800 The significant changes in our revenue trends by product type from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006, and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005, were the year to year increases in our other analog product category, primarily as a result of increased sales of products used in video game applications and continued growth in converters and amplifiers. Sales of products in the power management and reference product category were lower in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of our decision to deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop computers. The year to year declines from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, and from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, in the DSP product category were primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from our general purpose DSP products. Revenue Trends by Geographic Region The percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2007 2006 2005 United States 26 % 27 % 27 % Europe 24 % 24 % 25 % Japan 20 % 20 % 20 % China 13 % 11 % 9 % Rest of Asia* 17 % 18 % 19 % * The predominant countries comprising Rest of Asia are Taiwan and Korea. There was no major shift in the distribution of revenue by geographic region in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. 26 Table of Contents Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Gross Margin $ 1,519,217 $ 1,403,166 $ 1,281,315 Gross Margin % 59.7 % 59.9 % 60.0 % Gross margin in fiscal 2007 decreased by 20 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2006. This decrease was primarily the result of higher sales of products used in consumer electronics, which currently earn relatively lower gross margins than our average gross margin. This decrease was partially offset by the $35 million in revenue recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. Fiscal year 2006 cost of sales also included approximately $20.3 million of restructuring related expenses, of which $18.3 million was accelerated depreciation. Gross margin in fiscal 2006 decreased by 10 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2005. This decrease was the result of recognizing $29.3 million of stock based compensation expense, restructuring related and acquisition related expenses in cost of sales in fiscal 2006. The restructuring expense primarily related to accelerated depreciation of $18.3 million. These increases in expenses were partially offset by an increase in utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities and increased sales of higher margin products during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Stock based Compensation Expense During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, on October 30, 2005, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective application method. Compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of the options as calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option pricing model requires us to make several assumptions. One of the key assumptions is expected volatility. For options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used historical volatility to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options. We changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility. This change was the result of a thorough review we undertook, which included consultations with several third party advisors. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the markets current expectations of future volatility. Historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time during which our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines. We believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for share based payments to employees under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, using the intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options. The adoption of SFAS 123R under the modified prospective application method allowed us to recognize compensation cost beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirement of SFAS 123R for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that were unvested on the effective date. Under the modified prospective application method, prior periods are not restated for the effect of SFAS 123R. We used the graded attribution method to recognize expense for all options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R on October 30, 2005, we switched to the straight line attribution method to recognize expense for all grants made after October 29, 2005. The expense associated with the unvested portion of the pre adoption grants continues to be expensed using the graded attribution method. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R on October 18, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded to employees after December 31, 2000 that had exercise prices of $40.00 per share or greater. The vesting of options issued to our corporate officers and directors was not accelerated. Unvested options to purchase approximately 18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration. Because the exercise 27 Table of Contents price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of the modification, no stock based compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25. The primary purpose for modifying the terms of these out of the money stock options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized non cash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these stock options as measured under SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, because the approximately $188 million ($134 million net of tax) of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification. Our income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007, are $67.0 million and $47.3 million lower, respectively, than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under APB Opinion 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007 were $0.15 and $0.14 lower, respectively, than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under APB Opinion 25. We expect that stock based compensation related to our adoption of SFAS 123R will reduce diluted EPS by approximately $0.03 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Our income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006, were $69.8 million and $49.7 million lower, respectively, than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under APB Opinion 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2006 were $0.14 and $0.13 lower, respectively, than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under APB Opinion 25. As of November 3, 2007, the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately $144.5 million (before tax consideration), which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our adoption of SFAS 123R. Research and Development (RD) Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 RD Expenses $ 519,315 $ 469,396 $ 438,183 RD Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 20.7 % 20.0 % 20.5 % RD expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by $49.9 million, or 11%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2006. The increase in RD expense was primarily the result of an increase in employee salary and benefit expense in fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of an increase in our employee population and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week of operations in fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expense during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. RD expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by $31.2 million, or 7%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2005. The increase in RD expense in fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of recognizing $29.6 million of stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123R and an increase in employee bonus expense. These increases were partially offset by the savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. RD expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of RD projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to RD is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant RD investments in the future. 28 Table of Contents Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMGA) Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 SMGA Expenses $ 393,221 $ 387,874 $ 333,091 SMGA Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 15.7 % 16.6 % 15.6 % SMGA expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by $5.3 million, or 1%, from the levels recorded in fiscal 2006. The increase in SMGA expenses was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense and an extra week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expense and $8.5 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. SMGA expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by $54.8 million, or 16%, from the levels recorded in fiscal 2005. The increase in SMGA expenses was primarily the result of recording $32.6 million of stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and higher employee salary, benefit and bonus expenses. These increases were partially offset by savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Purchased In process Research and Development Fiscal Year 2006 TTPCom Limited $ 5,500 Integrant 11,124 AudioAsics 5,087 Total Purchased in Process RD $ 21,711 We incurred charges totaling $21.7 million for the write off of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility associated with our acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006. There were no charges for the write off of in process research and development in fiscal 2007 or 2005. See Acquisitions below for additional information regarding these acquisitions. Special Charges Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $20.3 million as a result of a decision to close our California wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, or SFAS 88, under our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees. The severance benefit was calculated based on length of past service, and employees had to continue to be employed until they were involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We completed the final cleanup and closure activities associated with this action during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006, which consisted of $18.3 million of non cash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and $2.0 million for stay on bonuses. We reversed approximately $2.0 million of our severance accrual during fiscal 2006 because some employees voluntarily left the company, other employees found alternative employment within the company, and there was an over accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments, normally paid as income continuance, were paid in lump sum payments, which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments. We have terminated the employment of all of the remaining employees included in this action. 29 Table of Contents We ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on November 9, 2006. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded additional expense, in accordance with SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which consisted of $3.2 million for clean up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and $0.4 million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge, in accordance with SFAS 146, which included $5.0 million of expense for future lease obligation costs for the wafer fabrication facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Also included in this special charge was $1.7 million for clean up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. The clean up activity was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action. The closure of this facility has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007. These annual savings include: approximately $49 million in cost of sales, of which approximately $7 million relates to non cash depreciation savings, and approximately $1 million in SMGA expenses. At current demand levels, if this facility were still in operation, the capacity of the facility would be largely underutilized resulting in significant adverse manufacturing variances associated with the underutilization of our wafer fabrication facilities. Reorganization of Product Development and Support Programs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $11.2 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal processing product programs. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. During fiscal 2006, we recorded an additional special charge of $3.8 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write off of property, plant and equipment and other items at this facility. The remaining $2.3 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 46 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an additional special charge of $1.6 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $0.6 million of this charge was for contract termination costs. The remaining $1.0 million relates to severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for six engineering employees. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an additional special charge of $3.4 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $3.2 million relates to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or minimum statutory requirements at foreign locations for 20 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. The remaining $0.2 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we reversed approximately $0.9 million of our severance accrual because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company, and were therefore no longer entitled to severance payments. The employment of all employees included in this action has been terminated. We do not expect to incur any further charges related to this reorganization action. These organizational changes, which were fully implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, are expected to result in savings of approximately $30 million per year. These savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $17 million in RD expenses, approximately $10 million in SMGA expenses and approximately $3 million in cost of sales. A portion of these savings associated with these charges is reflected in our fiscal 2007 results. 30 Table of Contents Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2007 Special Charges Consolidation of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge of $13.7 million as a result of our decision to focus the wafer fabrication capacity at our Limerick facility on eight inch technology. Certain manufacturing processes and products produced on our six inch production line will transition to our existing eight inch production line in Limerick while others will transition to external foundries. The charge is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees. Production is expected to cease in the six inch wafer fabrication facility during the first half of 2009, and the affected employees will be terminated. These employees must continue to be employed until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We expect to incur additional expenses related to this action during fiscal year 2009 of approximately $6 million related to cleanup and closure costs. In accordance with SFAS 146, these costs will be expensed as incurred. The closure of this facility is estimated to result in annual cost savings of approximately $25 million per year, expected to start during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. These annual savings will be in cost of sales, of which approximately $1 million relates to non cash depreciation savings. Reduction of Overhead Infrastructure Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we decided to either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus investments in products and end markets where we have better opportunities for profitable growth. In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset Business. As a result of these decisions, we decided to reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing, engineering and SMGA to more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure. Consequently, we recorded a special charge of $12.3 million, of which $10.7 million is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 manufacturing employees and 127 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. The remaining $1.6 million is for contract termination costs related to a license agreement associated with products we will no longer develop and for which there is no future alternative use. As of November 3, 2007, 77 of the 152 employees included in this cost reduction action were still employed by us. These employees must continue to be employed until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. These cost reduction actions are expected to result in savings of approximately $15 million per year once substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. These savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately $7 million in RD expenses, approximately $6 million in SMGA expenses and approximately $2 million in cost of sales. Operating Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Operating income from Continuing Operations $ 566,186 $ 522,395 $ 478,561 Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 22.2 % 22.3 % 22.4 % Operating income increased by $43.8 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was the result of a $203.2 million increase in revenue, which was offset by a 0.2% reduction in gross margin percentage and a $72.3 million increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative, Special Charges and Purchased In process Research and Development. The $43.8 million, or 9%, increase in operating income in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of a 10% increase in revenue. This increase was partially offset by $69.8 million of stock based operating expenses associated with the adoption of SFAS 123R and the $21.7 million write off of purchased in process research and development as a result of our fiscal 2006 acquisitions. In addition, the special charges in fiscal 2006 were lower by $29.7 million than the special charges recorded in fiscal 2005. 31 Table of Contents Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Interest expense $ $ 52 $ 27 Interest income (77,007 ) (100,169 ) (71,688 ) Other, net (15,727 ) (10,472 ) (42 ) Total nonoperating income $ (92,734 ) $ (110,589 ) $ (71,703 ) The $17.9 million decrease in nonoperating income in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was a result of lower invested cash balances that were partially offset by the higher interest rates in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This decrease in interest income was partially offset by a $7.9 million gain from the sale of an investment and a $10.5 million settlement we received in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we also recognized a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line. Nonoperating income increased by $38.9 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily the result of higher interest income, which was primarily attributable to higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Nonoperating income for fiscal 2006 also included a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Provision for Income Taxes $ 158,444 $ 117,418 $ 174,320 Effective Income Tax Rate 24.0 % 18.5 % 31.7 % Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was higher by 550 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to the recording of tax benefits of $35.2 million associated with the completion of an Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, examination during fiscal 2006, including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit. The increase was also attributable to the following fiscal 2007 transactions, which were taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate: the one time receipt of $35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party, the gain on the sale of an investment of $7.9 million and the $19 million received from the settlement of litigation. In addition, we recorded an additional $4.4 million of taxes and penalties in fiscal 2007 for proposed adjustments related to the IRS examination of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and a $5.6 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of the accounting associated with a fiscal 2006 acquisition. These items were partially offset by a tax benefit of $4.7 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in fiscal 2007 and a $9.9 million cumulative adjustment recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the application of this credit to a portion of our fiscal 2006 results. The tax rate was lower in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the recording of tax benefits of $35.2 million associated with the completion of an IRS examination during fiscal 2006, including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit. In addition, the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal 2005 as a result of our repatriation of foreign earnings and the write off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our deferred compensation plan as more fully described below. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings, taking the benefit of current tax law allowing for earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 to be taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. In connection with the repatriation of earnings, we recorded additional income tax expense of $49 million in fiscal 2005. 32 Table of Contents We had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the 162(m) limitation of the Internal Revenue Code would not withdraw their balances from the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the deferred compensation plan, while they were still subject to the 162(m) limitation, and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal, generally upon their retirement. Due to changes in tax law during 2005 that were enacted as part of the AJCA, the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans changed. In fiscal 2005 three executive officers who were subject to the 162(m) limitation withdrew, or indicated their intention to withdraw a portion of their balances from the deferred compensation plan. As a result, we incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of $7.2 million due to the write off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in the deferred compensation plan. Net Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Net income from Continuing Operations $ 500,695 $ 516,314 $ 375,944 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 19.7 % 22.0 % 17.6 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 1.51 $ 1.39 $ 0.98 Net income from continuing operations was lower in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2006 by approximately $15.6 million primarily as a result of the $17.9 million decrease in nonoperating income and the impact of a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007, partially offset by the $43.8 million increase in operating income from continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations increased by $140.4 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily as the result of the 10% increase in revenue, the increase in nonoperating income and lower tax expense. This increase in net income was partially offset by a year to year increase in operating expenses of $78.0 million, primarily as a result of $62.2 million of stock based operating expenses related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and $22.2 million of operating expenses related to our acquisitions during fiscal 2006. These operating expense increases were partially offset by a $29.7 million decrease in special charges in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Discontinued Operations Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Net (loss) income from discontinued operations $ (3,788 ) $ 33,168 $ 38,843 Diluted (loss) earnings per share from discontinued operations $ (0.01 ) $ 0.09 $ 0.10 We entered into a definitive agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to sell our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. Accordingly, these operations have been presented as a discontinued operation within the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). We expect to record a gain from the sale of this business upon the completion of the sale in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We estimate this gain after taxes will be in the range of $150 million to $160 million. Acquisitions In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets associated with the support and customization of TTPComs GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future generations of SoftFone baseband processors. We also acquired development rights for AJAR, TTPComs advanced applications platform. As a result of this transaction, we became the single point of contact for both hardware and software support for our new and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving our abilities to 33 Table of Contents service the needs of individual customers. We paid TTPCom $11.9 million in initial cash payments. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The estimated fair values of the assets exceeded the initial payments by $7.8 million, resulting in negative goodwill. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No 141, Business Combinations, we recorded a liability for the contingent consideration that will be accounted for as additional purchase price, up to the amount of the negative goodwill. As contingent payments became due, the payments were applied against the contingent liability. As of October 28, 2006, we had paid $6 million of contingent payments and the remaining contingent liability was $1.8 million. The purchase price included $5.5 million of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The in process technology related to software code developed for use in our semiconductor chipsets manufactured for devices that use both the 2G and 2.5G cellular wireless technology standards. The fair value of the in process technology was determined with the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in process technology was approximately 56% complete. As of November 3, 2007, the in process research and development projects were complete. During fiscal 2007, we paid an additional $6.1 million of contingent consideration, which resulted in reducing the $1.8 million liability and recording additional goodwill of $4.3 million. As of November 3, 2007, all technological milestones have been met and no additional payments will be made. The acquisition also included $13.2 million of intangible assets that were being amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. As a result of the definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc., $7.9 million and $11.4 million of net intangible assets were reclassified to assets of discontinued operations at November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively, as the TTPCom assets will be transferred to Media Tek Inc. as part of the transaction. See Note 2u. to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding assets of discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened our presence in the Asian region. We paid $127.2 million in initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $33 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The initial cash payments included $4.2 million held in escrow for the purchase of the remaining non founder outstanding shares. These shares were purchased during fiscal 2007 and were recorded as additional goodwill. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We completed the final purchase accounting for this transaction during the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which resulted in an additional $5.6 million of goodwill. The $33 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $25 million for the achievement of revenue based milestones that may be payable during the period from July 2006 through December 2007 and $8 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. The additional cash payments will be recorded as additional purchase price. During fiscal 2007, we paid $3.5 million to repurchase founder shares. No revenue based milestones have been met as of November 3, 2007. The purchase price included $11.1 million of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in process technology related to technologies currently in development for Dual DAB, T DMB, DVB H, RFID and WiBro applications. The fair value of the in process technology was determined with the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in process technology was approximately 74% complete. As of November 3, 2007, the in process research and development projects were complete. The acquisition also included $21.6 million of intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing our low power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid $19.3 million in initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $8 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The $8 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $4.8 million for the achievement of revenue based milestones that may be 34 Table of Contents payable during the period from October 2006 through January 2009 and $3.2 million based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009. In order to be entitled to receive $2.4 million of the revenue based contingent consideration, certain key employees must continue to be employed by us. As such, that portion of the revenue based contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense when, and if, it is earned. The technological milestones require post acquisition services to be rendered in order to be achieved and, as such, will be recorded as compensation expense when earned. The purchase price included $5.1 million of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in process technology related to technologies currently in development for analog and digital microphone pre amplifiers. The fair value of the in process technology was determined with the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in process technology was approximately 69% complete. As of November 3, 2007, the in process research and development projects were complete. The acquisition also included $8.3 million of intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. As of November 3, 2007, no contingent consideration has been paid. Pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and AudioAsics have not been provided herein as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. The results of operations of each acquisition are included in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. Related Party Transaction One of our directors, who has served on our Board of Directors since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002 and continues to serve as a director of TSMC. Management believes the terms and prices for the purchases of products from TSMC are not affected by the presence of one of our directors on the Board of Directors of TSMC. We purchased approximately $302 million, $281 million and $224 million of products from TSMC in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately $47 million and $17 million were payable to TSMC as of November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively. We anticipate that we will make significant purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 820,365 $ 621,102 $ 672,704 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Total Revenue 32.2 % 26.5 % 31.5 % At November 3, 2007, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1,081.2 million, a decrease of $1,047.1 million from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2007 were net cash generated from operating activities of $820.4 million and proceeds of $109.1 million from our employee stock plans. The principal uses of funds during fiscal 2007 were the repurchase of approximately 45.9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $1,647.2 million, dividend payments of $228.3 million and capital expenditures of $141.8 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. The cash flows from this discontinued operation have been combined with the operating, investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations (i.e. no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations) for all periods presented. We believe the absence of the cash flows from this discontinued operation will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position. Additionally, as a result of this agreement, we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to this business to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations. See Note 2u. to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding this discontinued operation. The anticipated closure of the sale of our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and the anticipated closure of the sale of our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to ON Semiconductor 35 Table of Contents Corporation are expected to generate approximately $250 million to $270 million of cash in fiscal 2008 after the payment of all applicable taxes. Fiscal Year 2007 2006 Accounts Receivable $ 336,381 $ 305,761 Days Sales Outstanding* 47 46 Inventory $ 347,519 $ 362,945 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory* 118 133 * We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory. Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2007 increased by $30.6 million, or 10%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2006. This increase was the result of higher sales in the last month of fiscal 2007 as compared to the last month of fiscal 2006. Inventories at the end of fiscal 2007 decreased by $15.4 million, or 4%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2006 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal 2007 decreased by 15 days from the amount at the end of fiscal 2006. The decrease in inventory is a result of our continued effort to balance production, demand and inventory levels as well as the sale of inventory (valued at approximately $19 million at October 28, 2006) which had been built during fiscal 2006 in anticipation of the closure of the Sunnyvale, California wafer fabrication facility. Current liabilities increased to $548.1 million at November 3, 2007, an increase of $57.2 million, or 11.6%, from $490.9 million at the end of fiscal 2006. Net additions to property, plant and equipment including that related to our Baseband Chipset Business, which is reflected as a discontinued operation, were $141.8 million in fiscal 2007, $129.3 million in fiscal 2006 and $85.5 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2008 capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $160 million. During fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.70 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of $228.3 million in fiscal 2007. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on November 26, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 26, 2007 to shareholders of record on December 7, 2007 and is expected to total approximately $54 million. On May 11, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004 from $500 million to $1 billion. On March 14, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion of our common stock, increasing the total amount of our common stock we can repurchase from $1 billion to $2 billion of our common stock. On December 6, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion of our common stock, increasing the total amount of our common stock we are authorized to repurchase from $2 billion to $3 billion. On June 6, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion of our common stock, increasing the total amount of our common stock we are authorized to repurchase from $3 billion to $4 billion. Under the repurchase program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased approximately $1,647.2 million of our common stock under this plan. As of November 3, 2007, we had $665.2 million of authorized repurchases remaining under our repurchase program. We plan to continue to repurchase shares during fiscal 2008. The timing and number of shares repurchased can not be reasonably estimated at this time; however, from the end of fiscal year 2007 through November 26, 2007, we repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for approximately $151 million. 36 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 3, 2007: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 91,478 $ 30,774 $ 39,173 $ 9,272 $ 12,259 Deferred compensation planb 36,553 1,233 1,233 34,087 Pension fundingc 7,993 7,993 Total $ 136,024 $ 40,000 $ 40,406 $ 9,272 $ 46,346 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23, 1997. The amount in the More than 5 Years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the More than 5 Years column of the table. All other columns represent installment payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are on long term disability. (c) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2008. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements. The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. At November 3, 2007, our principal source of liquidity was $1,081.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Off balance Sheet Financing As of November 3, 2007, we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook made by the Company. Upon entering into the definitive agreement to sell our CPU Voltage regulator and PC thermal monitoring 37 Table of Contents business on November 8, 2007, the assets of this business met the held for sale criteria, and will therefore be reclassified as discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. This business generated approximately $25 million of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Therefore, once we reclassify the $25 million of revenue to discontinued operations, our fourth quarter revenue will be $623 million. On this basis, we expect product sales from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to be approximately $610 million to $635 million. Gross margin percentage is planned to be up slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Diluted EPS is planned to be approximately $0.38 to $0.42 for the first quarter of fiscal 2008. As previously announced, we also expect to close on the sales of two businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The estimated gains on these sales are not reflected in the estimates above. We expect to realize a gain, net of tax, of between approximately $150 million and $160 million related to the sale of our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. We also expect to recognize a gain, net of taxes of between approximately $52 million and $60 million related to the sale of our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business. The gains on both of these sales will be included in income from discontinued operations. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, which is our fiscal year 2009 that begins on November 2, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 159 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. This standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which is our fiscal year 2009 that begins on November 2, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS 157 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Accounting for Prior Year Misstatements In September 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). This SAB provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects on each of the companys balance sheet and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures. SAB 108 permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after November 15, 2006 by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings. Additionally, the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose. The adoption of SAB 108 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 38 Table of Contents Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur. It also requires the measurement date of plan assets and obligations to occur at the end of the employers fiscal year. SFAS 158 was effective for us at the end of fiscal 2007, except for the change in measurement date, which is effective for us in fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS 158 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that FIN 48 may have on our financial condition or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. 39 Table of Contents Long Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under SFAS 142, we utilize the entity wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At November 3, 2007, we had gross deferred tax assets of $210.9 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a $46.8 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. 40 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation The adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 required that stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income, rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements. Determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant date fair values using the Black Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third party estimates, when estimating volatility. For options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used historical volatility to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options. We changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted for fiscal 2005 and thereafter from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility. This change was the result of a thorough review we undertook, which included consultations with several third party advisors. Historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time when our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines. We believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior, and as such, we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the markets current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that: (1) options in the Companys common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near the money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year. Expected term We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black Scholes grant date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant date fair value of the option. Risk free interest rate The yield on zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate. Expected dividend yield Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarters cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock based awards as of November 3, 2007. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent 41 Table of Contents liability should be recorded in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 12 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, our annual interest income would change by approximately $9 million and $16 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006 would change by approximately $2 million and $6 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2i. in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. The fair values of these instruments were approximately $7 million at November 3, 2007 and were insignificant at October 28, 2006. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For contracts outstanding at November 3, 2007, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the rates as of our 2007 fiscal year end would increase the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments by approximately $24 million and a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would decrease their fair value by approximately $9 million. As at October 28, 2006, a 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the rates as of our 2006 fiscal year end would not expose us to significant gains or losses in the contracts fair values. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 42 Table of Contents
