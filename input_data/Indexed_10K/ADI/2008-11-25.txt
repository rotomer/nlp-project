ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including in particular the section entitled Outlook contains forward looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, continues, may, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections regarding our future financial performance, particularly in light of the global credit and financial market crisis; our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, our capital needs and capital expenditures; our market position and competitive changes in the marketplace for our products; our ability to innovate new products and technologies; the effectiveness of our efforts to refocus our operations and reduce our cost structure; our ability to access credit or capital markets; our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock; our third party suppliers; intellectual property and litigation matters; potential acquisitions or divestitures; key personnel; the effect of new accounting pronouncements and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10 K. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities related to these businesses are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007. The historical results of operations of these businesses have been segregated from our consolidated financial statements and are included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of income. Unless otherwise noted, this Managements Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations. Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Total Revenue $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 $ 2,250,100 Gross Margin % 61.1 % 61.2 % 61.9 % Net income from Continuing Operations $ 525,177 $ 502,123 $ 519,175 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 20.3 % 20.4 % 23.1 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 1.77 $ 1.51 $ 1.40 Diluted EPS $ 2.65 $ 1.50 $ 1.48 The year to year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product. In fiscal year 2008, our product revenue increased 6% from fiscal 2007 and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 17%. We sold two businesses during the year that resulted in net cash proceeds of $403 million and a $248 million net gain in fiscal 2008. We report these two businesses below as discontinued operations. Our fiscal 2008 cash flow from operations was $669 million, or 26% of revenue, and we had $1,310 million of cash and short term investments and no debt as of November 1, 2008. 23 Table of Contents While we achieved good operating results for fiscal 2008, the global credit crisis and deteriorating economic conditions have resulted in more cautious customer spending behavior and generally lower demand for our products. We cannot predict the severity, duration or precise impact of the economic downturn on our future financial results. Consequently, our reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 may not be indicative of our future results. Order rates slowed in late September 2008, and backlog declined significantly from the prior quarter, which limits our short term visibility. Forecasting revenue in this environment is difficult. Therefore, as more fully described in the Outlook section below, our operating plan is for revenues to decline approximately 20% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from the amount recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Revenue Trends by End Market The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2008 2007* 2006 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Industrial $ 1,274,924 49 % 6 % $ 1,198,984 49 % $ 1,117,602 50 % Communications 637,277 25 % 21 % 527,287 22 % 498,199 22 % Consumer 544,274 21 % (2 )% 557,373 23 % 449,754 20 % Computer 126,456 5 % (13 )% 146,077 6 % 184,545 8 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,582,931 100 % 6 % $ 2,429,721 100 % $ 2,250,100 100 % Revenue from one time IP license 35,000 Total Revenue $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 $ 2,250,100 * The year ended November 3, 2007 was a 53 week year. We follow a 52 week, or 364 day fiscal calendar that results in a 53 week year approximately every seventh year, as occurred in fiscal 2007. Industrial The year to year increase from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the instrumentation and automotive sectors and, to a lesser extent, the defense sector. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from automatic test equipment. The year to year increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the automotive area and to a lesser extent the instrumentation portion of the industrial end market. These sales increases were partially offset by a decline in sales to automatic test equipment customers. Communications The year to year increases from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 were primarily the result of revenue growth in sales of analog products used in basestations and wireless handsets. The increase in sales from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was partially offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers. Consumer The year to year decrease from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from advanced television and digital camera applications that was offset by a decline in revenue from other consumer applications, consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending. The year to year increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of increased sales of our products used in video game applications, advanced television systems and digital home applications. 24 Table of Contents Computer The year to year decreases from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 were primarily the result of broad based declines in sales of our products into this end market. Revenue from One Time IP License During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded revenue of $35 million received in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2008 2007* 2006 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Converters $ 1,190,964 46 % 8 % $ 1,104,842 46 % $ 1,021,174 45 % Amplifiers 590,275 23 % 6 % 557,515 23 % 532,046 24 % Other analog 393,856 15 % (0 )% 395,494 16 % 312,401 14 % Subtotal analog signal processing 2,175,095 84 % 6 % 2,057,851 85 % 1,865,621 83 % Power management reference 143,702 6 % 16 % 124,101 5 % 126,833 6 % Total analog products $ 2,318,797 90 % 6 % $ 2,181,952 90 % $ 1,992,454 89 % General purpose DSP 234,946 9 % 10 % 214,339 9 % 205,483 9 % Other DSP 29,188 1 % (13 )% 33,430 1 % 52,163 2 % Total DSP products $ 264,134 10 % 7 % $ 247,769 10 % $ 257,646 11 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,582,931 100 % 6 % $ 2,429,721 100 % $ 2,250,100 100 % Revenue from one time IP license 35,000 Total Revenue $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 $ 2,250,100 * The year ended November 3, 2007 was a 53 week year. We follow a 52 week, or 364 day fiscal calendar that results in a 53 week year approximately every seventh year, as occurred in fiscal 2007. The increase in sales from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was the result of a broad based increase in sales across many of our product categories. The increase in sales of converters and amplifiers was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our products used in the industrial and communications end markets. The significant changes in our revenue trends by product type from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 were the year to year increases in our converters and amplifiers. In addition the other analog product category increased primarily as a result of increased sales of products used in video game applications. The year to year decrease from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 in the other DSP product category was primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in fiscal 2006. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues from our general purpose DSP products. 25 Table of Contents Revenue Trends by Geographic Region The percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2008 2007 2006 United States 20 % 23 % 24 % Rest of North and South America 4 % 3 % 4 % Europe 26 % 24 % 24 % Japan 19 % 21 % 21 % China 16 % 13 % 11 % Rest of Asia 15 % 16 % 16 % The predominant countries comprising Rest of North and South America are Canada and Mexico. The predominant countries comprising European operations are Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The predominant countries comprising Rest of Asia are Taiwan and Korea. Revenue in the United States declined from 24% to 20% of total revenue over the past three fiscal years. This geographic shift of revenue reflects the increased manufacturing activity of our customers in locations outside the United States, primarily China and our success in markets located outside of the United States. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Gross Margin $ 1,577,275 $ 1,508,276 $ 1,393,601 Gross Margin % 61.1 % 61.2 % 61.9 % Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2008 was lower by 10 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2007. Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 was higher primarily as a result of recording revenue of $35 million we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 decreased by 70 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2006. This decrease was primarily the result of higher sales of products used in consumer electronics in fiscal 2007, which were primarily manufactured at external foundries where we earned lower gross margins compared to our average gross margin. This gross margin percentage decrease in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by the $35 million in revenue recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. Fiscal year 2006 cost of sales also included approximately $20.3 million of restructuring related expenses, of which $18.3 million was accelerated depreciation. Stock based Compensation Expense During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, on October 30, 2005, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. We calculate compensation cost on the date of grant using the fair value of stock options as calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of November 1, 2008, the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately $116.7 million (before tax consideration), which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our adoption of SFAS 123R. 26 Table of Contents Research and Development (RD) Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 RD Expenses $ 533,480 $ 509,553 $ 459,846 RD Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 20.7 % 21.0 % 20.4 % RD expenses in fiscal 2008 increased by $23.9 million, or 5%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary, benefit and bonus expenses, which were partially offset by one fewer week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 and lower employee stock option expenses. RD expenses in fiscal 2007 increased by $49.7 million, or 11%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2006. The increase in RD expenses was primarily the result of an increase in employee salary and benefit expense in fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of an increase in our employee population and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week of operations in fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expenses during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. RD expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of RD projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to RD is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant RD investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMGA) Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 SMGA Expenses $ 415,682 $ 389,505 $ 384,051 SMGA Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 16.1 % 16.0 % 17.1 % SMGA expenses increased by $26.2 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2008 as compared to the amount recorded in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary, benefit and bonus expenses, which were partially offset by lower employee stock option expenses and one less week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 also included $8.5 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in fiscal 2007. SMGA expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by $5.5 million, or 1%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2006. The increase in SMGA expenses was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expenses and to a lesser extent an extra week of operations in fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expenses and $8.5 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in fiscal 2007. Purchased In process Research and Development Fiscal Year 2006 TTPCom Limited $ 5,500 Integrant 11,124 AudioAsics 5,087 Total Purchased in Process RD $ 21,711 We incurred charges totaling $21.7 million for the write off of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility associated with our acquisitions in fiscal 2006. There were no charges for the write off of 27 Table of Contents in process research and development in fiscal 2008 or 2007. See Acquisitions below for additional information regarding these acquisitions. Special Charges Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $20.3 million as a result of a decision to close our California wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that we recorded pursuant to SFAS 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, or SFAS 88, under our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees. The severance benefit is based on the length of past service, and employees had to continue to be employed until their employment was involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We completed the final cleanup and closure activities associated with this action during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006 related to the Sunnyvale facility closure, which consisted of $18.3 million of non cash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and $2.0 million for stay on bonuses for certain employees critical to facilitating the closure of this facility. We reversed approximately $2.0 million of the severance accrual during fiscal 2006 because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company. In addition, there was an over accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments, normally paid as income continuance, were paid in lump sum payments, which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments. We have terminated the employment of all of the employees included in this action. We ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on November 9, 2006. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded additional expense, in accordance with SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities or, SFAS 146, which consisted of $3.2 million for clean up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and $0.4 million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge, in accordance with SFAS 146, which included $5.0 million of expense for future lease obligation costs for the wafer fabrication facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The lease obligation costs are being paid out on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which expires in 2010. Also included in this special charge was $1.7 million for facility clean up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. We completed the clean up activity during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action. The closure of this facility has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007. These annual savings include: approximately $49 million in cost of sales, of which approximately $7 million relates to non cash depreciation savings, and approximately $1 million in SMGA expenses. At current demand levels, if this facility were still in operation, the capacity of the facility would be largely underutilized resulting in significant adverse manufacturing variances associated with the underutilization of our wafer fabrication facilities. Reorganization of Product Development and Support Programs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge of $11.2 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal processing product programs. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees associated with these programs. During fiscal 2006, we recorded an additional special charge of $3.8 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility that we ceased using 28 Table of Contents during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write off of property, plant and equipment and other items at this facility. The remaining $2.3 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 46 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees associated with these programs. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an additional special charge of $1.6 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $0.6 million of this charge was for contract termination costs. The remaining $1.0 million relates to severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for six engineering employees associated with these programs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an additional special charge of $3.4 million related to this reorganization action. Approximately $3.2 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or minimum statutory requirements at foreign locations for 20 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. The remaining $0.2 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we reversed approximately $0.9 million of our severance accrual because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company, and were therefore no longer entitled to severance payments. The employment of all employees associated with these programs has been terminated and amounts owed to employees for severance are being paid out as income continuance. We do not expect to incur any further charges related to this reorganization action. These organizational changes, which were fully implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, have resulted in savings of approximately $30 million per year. These annual savings include: approximately $17 million in RD expenses, approximately $10 million in SMGA expenses and approximately $3 million in cost of sales. As this action was completed during fiscal 2007, a portion of these annual savings is reflected in our results for fiscal 2007 and all of the annual savings are reflected in our fiscal 2008 results. Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2007 Special Charges Consolidation of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge of $13.7 million as a result of our decision to only use eight inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in Limerick. Certain manufacturing processes and products produced on the Limerick facilitys six inch production line will transition to our existing eight inch production line in Limerick while others will transition to external foundries. The charge is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees associated with these action. As of November 1, 2008, 126 of the 150 employees included in this cost reduction action were still employed by us. We expect production to cease in the six inch wafer fabrication facility during the first half of 2009, at which time the employment of the remaining affected employees will be terminated. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded an additional charge of $1.5 million related to this action, of which $1.2 million was an adjustment to our original estimate of the severance costs and $0.3 million was for clean up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. We expect to incur additional clean up and closure costs related to this action over the next three quarters totaling approximately $1.5 million. In accordance with SFAS 146, we will expense these costs as incurred. We estimate that the closure of this facility will result in annual cost savings of approximately $25 million per year, expected to start during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We expect these annual savings will be in cost of sales, of which approximately $1 million relates to non cash depreciation savings. Reduction of Overhead Infrastructure Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we decided to either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus investments in products and end markets where we have better opportunities for profitable growth. In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset Business. As a result, we decided to reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing, engineering and SMGA to more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure. Consequently, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we 29 Table of Contents recorded a special charge of $12.3 million, of which $10.7 million was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 manufacturing employees and 127 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees associated with this action. The remaining $1.6 million was for contract termination costs related to a license agreement associated with products we will no longer develop and for which there is no future alternative use. As of November 1, 2008, we still employed 6 of the 152 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We expect these cost reduction actions, which were substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, to result in savings of approximately $15 million per year. We expect these savings to be realized as follows: approximately $7 million in RD expenses, approximately $6 million in SMGA expenses and approximately $2 million in cost of sales. A portion of these savings is reflected in our results for fiscal 2008. Fourth Quarter of 2008 Special Charge During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we decided to further reduce the operating cost structure of our company. Consequently, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we recorded a special charge of $1.6 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 19 engineering and SMGA employees. As of November 1, 2008 we still employed, 14 of the 19 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We expect this cost reduction action, which we expect to complete during the first quarter of fiscal 2009, to result in savings of approximately $2.1 million per year. We expect these savings to be realized as follows: approximately $0.5 million in RD expenses and approximately $1.6 million in SMGA expenses. Operating Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Operating income from Continuing Operations $ 625,025 $ 568,723 $ 526,203 Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 24.2 % 23.1 % 23.4 % The $56.3 million, or 10%, increase in operating income in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in total revenue of $118.2 million and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in special charges of $37.4 million. This increase in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a 10 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage, an increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative, and the fact that fiscal 2007 included $35 million in non product revenue that we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. Operating income increased by $42.5 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was the result of a $214.6 million increase in revenue, which was partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and a $72.2 million increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative, Special Charges and Purchased In process Research and Development. Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Interest income (41,041 ) (77,007 ) (100,117 ) Other, net (36 ) (15,727 ) (10,472 ) Total nonoperating income $ (41,077 ) $ (92,734 ) $ (110,589 ) Nonoperating income in fiscal 2008 was lower by $51.7 million as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of lower average invested cash balances and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates in fiscal 2008 as compared 30 Table of Contents to fiscal 2007. In addition, other income in fiscal 2007 included $10.5 million we received as part of a litigation settlement and a $7.9 million gain from the sale of an investment. The $17.9 million decrease in nonoperating income in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was a result of lower invested cash balances that were partially offset by the higher interest rates in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This decrease in interest income was partially offset by a $7.9 million gain from the sale of an investment and a $10.5 million settlement we received in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we also recognized a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our DSP based DSL ASIC and network processor product line. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Provision for Income Taxes $ 140,925 $ 159,553 $ 118,365 Effective Income Tax Rate 21.2 % 24.1 % 18.6 % Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was lower by 290 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007. The 2007 tax rate included the following transactions, which were taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate: the one time receipt of $35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party, $19 million we received from a settlement of litigation and the $7.9 million gain on the sale of an investment. In addition, the 2007 tax rate included tax expense related to the finalization of the accounting for a 2006 acquisition. These items, which had the effect of increasing the 2007 tax rate, were partially offset by a higher RD credit in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2008. In addition to these isolated transactions that impacted our tax rate, a larger percentage of our profits were earned in lower tax jurisdictions during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007 causing a decrease in our tax rate. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was higher by 550 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to the recording of tax benefits of $35.2 million associated with the completion of an Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, examination during fiscal 2006, including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit. The increase was also attributable to the following fiscal 2007 transactions, which were taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate: the one time receipt of $35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party, the gain on the sale of an investment of $7.9 million and $19 million received from the settlement of litigation. In addition, we recorded an additional $4.4 million of taxes and penalties in fiscal 2007 for proposed adjustments related to the IRS examination of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and a $5.6 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of the accounting associated with a fiscal 2006 acquisition. These items were partially offset by a tax benefit of $4.7 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in fiscal 2007 and a $9.9 million cumulative adjustment recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the application of this credit to a portion of our fiscal 2006 results. Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax $ 525,177 $ 502,123 $ 519,175 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax as a % of Total Revenue 20.3 % 20.4 % 23.1 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 1.77 $ 1.51 $ 1.40 Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2008 was higher than in fiscal 2007 by approximately $23.1 million primarily as a result of the $56.3 million increase in operating income from continuing operations that was partially offset by a $51.7 million decrease in nonoperating income and a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2008. 31 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations, net of tax, was lower in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2006 by approximately $17.1 million primarily as a result of the $17.9 million decrease in nonoperating income and the impact of a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007. These items, which had the impact of decreasing 2007 income from continuing operations, net of tax, were partially offset by the $42.5 million increase in operating income from continuing operations. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Discontinued Operations Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 12,779 $ (5,216 ) $ 30,307 Gain on sale of Discontinued Operations, net of tax 248,328 Total income (loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 261,107 $ (5,216 ) $ 30,307 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from Discontinued Operations $ 0.88 $ (0.02 ) $ 0.08 We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Acquisitions In fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets associated with the support and customization of TTPComs GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future generations of SoftFone baseband processors. We also acquired development rights for AJAR, TTPComs advanced applications platform. As a result of this transaction, we became the single point of contact for both hardware and software support for our new and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving our ability to service the needs of individual customers. We paid TTPCom $11.9 million in initial cash payments. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The estimated fair values of the assets exceeded the initial payments by $7.8 million, resulting in negative goodwill. Pursuant to SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, we recorded a liability for the contingent consideration that was accounted for as additional purchase price, up to the amount of the negative goodwill. As contingent payments became due, we applied the payments against the contingent liability. As of October 28, 2006, we had paid $6 million of contingent payments and the remaining contingent liability was $1.8 million. The purchase price included $5.5 million of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during fiscal 2006. The in process technology related to software code developed for use in our semiconductor chipsets manufactured for devices that use both the 2G and 2.5G cellular wireless technology standards. We determined the fair value of the in process technology with the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in process technology was approximately 56% complete. We completed the in process research and development projects during fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we paid an additional $6.1 million of contingent consideration, which resulted in reducing the $1.8 million liability and recording additional goodwill of $4.3 million. All technological milestones have been met and no additional payments will be made. The acquisition also included $13.2 million of intangible assets that we were amortizing over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. As a result of the sale of our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc., we reclassified $7.9 million of net intangible assets to assets of discontinued operations at November 3, 2007 and transferred them to MediaTek Inc. during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. See Note 2u. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information on assets of discontinued operations. 32 Table of Contents In fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened our presence in the Asian region. We paid $127.2 million in initial cash payments at closing and were obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $33 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The initial cash payments included $4.2 million held in escrow for the purchase of the remaining non founder outstanding shares. We purchased these shares during fiscal 2007 and recorded them as additional goodwill. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We completed the final purchase accounting for this transaction during fiscal 2007, which resulted in an additional $5.6 million of goodwill. The $33 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $25 million for the achievement of revenue based milestones during the period from July 2006 through December 2007, none of which were met, and $8.4 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. We recorded or will record these payments as additional purchase price. We have paid $6.3 million to repurchase founder shares through November 1, 2008 and will make the remaining $2.1 million payment during fiscal 2009. The purchase price included $11.1 million of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in process technology related to technologies currently in development for Dual DAB, T DMB, DVB H, RFID and WiBro applications. We determined the fair value of the in process technology with the assistance of a third party using the income forecast approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in process technology was approximately 74% complete. We completed the in process research and development projects during fiscal 2007. The acquisition also included $21.6 million of intangible assets that we are amortizing over their estimated useful lives of two to five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. In fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing low power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid $19.3 million in initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of $8 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The $8 million of potential cash payments is comprised of $4.8 million for the achievement of revenue based milestones that may be payable during the period from October 2006 through January 2009 and $3.2 million based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009. If the revenue based milestone is met by January 2009, it will be recorded as additional goodwill. The technological milestones required post acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, we recorded them as compensation expense in fiscal 2008. These technological milestones were achieved during fiscal 2008 and will be paid during fiscal 2009. The purchase price included $5.1 million of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in process technology related to technologies currently in development for analog and digital microphone pre amplifiers. We determined the fair value of the in process technology with the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in process technology was approximately 69% complete. We completed the in process research and development projects during fiscal 2007. The acquisition also included $8.3 million of intangible assets that we are amortizing over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. We have not provided pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and AudioAsics herein as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 669,368 $ 820,365 $ 621,102 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Total Revenue 25.9 % 33.3 % 27.6 % 33 Table of Contents At November 1, 2008, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1,309.7 million, an increase of $228.5 million from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2008 were net cash generated from operating activities of $669.4 million, $403.2 million received from the sale of two businesses and proceeds of $94.2 million from the exercise of stock options. The principal uses of funds during fiscal 2008 were the repurchase of approximately 19.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $569.9 million, dividend payments of $222.5 million, and capital expenditures of $157.4 million. Included in the cash flow from operations is $110.4 million of tax payments related to the sale of the two businesses. Under SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, all income tax payments are included in determining net cash flow from operating activities, but the cash received from the sale of the businesses must be reported as an investing cash inflow. We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cash flows from these discontinued operations have been combined with the operating, investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations (i.e. no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations) for all periods presented. We believe the absence of the cash flows from these discontinued operations will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position. Additionally, as a result of these dispositions, we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations. See Note 2u. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding these discontinued operations. Fiscal Year 2008 2007 Accounts Receivable $ 315,290 $ 323,777 Days Sales Outstanding* 44 47 Inventory $ 314,629 $ 324,373 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory* 112 119 * We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory. Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2008 decreased by $8.5 million, or 3%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2007. This decrease was the result of lower product shipments in the last month of fiscal 2008 as compared to the last month of fiscal 2007. Inventories at the end of fiscal 2008 decreased by $9.7 million, or 3%, from the amount at the end of fiscal 2007 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal 2008 decreased by 7 days from the amount at the end of fiscal 2007. This decrease in inventory is primarily the result of lower revenue forecasted for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Current liabilities increased to $569.1 million at November 1, 2008, an increase of $21.0 million, or 4%, from $548.1 million at the end of fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in accrued liabilities as a result of increases in compensation and benefit accruals and to a lesser extent an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors as a result of our shipments to distributors in fiscal 2008 exceeding the distributors sales to their end customers. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable. Net additions to property, plant and equipment including discontinued operations, were $157.4 million in fiscal 2008, $141.8 million in fiscal 2007 and $129.3 million in fiscal 2006. We expect fiscal 2009 capital expenditures to total approximately $55 million. During fiscal 2008, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.76 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of $222.5 million. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on November 20, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 24, 2008 to shareholders of record on December 5, 2008 and is expected to total approximately $58.2 million. 34 Table of Contents Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $4 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. We repurchased approximately 19.4 million shares for approximately $569.9 million during fiscal 2008. As of November 1, 2008, we had repurchased a total of approximately 114.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3,904.7 million under this program and an additional $95.4 million remains under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options. Any future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon the amount of cash we have available to us in the United States. At November 1, 2008, our principal source of liquidity was $1,309.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of November 1, 2008, approximately $89.0 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the United States, including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases. As a result, we entered into a five year $165 million unsecured revolving credit facility in May 2008 in order to supplement our occasional cash requirements in the United States. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions. However, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and purchases of stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of November 1, 2008: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 83,492 $ 27,929 $ 36,201 $ 8,802 $ 10,560 Deferred compensation planb 32,742 942 31,800 Pension fundingc 7,624 7,624 Total $ 123,858 $ 36,495 $ 36,201 $ 8,802 $ 42,360 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23, 1997. The amount in the More than 5 Years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation 35 Table of Contents to these participants in the More than 5 Years column of the table. All other columns represent installment payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are on long term disability. (c) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2009. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements. As of November 1, 2008, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions under FIN 48 was $20.2 million, which are included in Other non current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K as a result of our adoption of FIN 48. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table. The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. Off balance Sheet Financing As of November 1, 2008, we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook made by us. The global credit crisis and deteriorating economic conditions have resulted in more cautious customer spending behavior and generally lower demand. Order rates slowed in late September 2008, and backlog declined significantly from the prior quarter, which limits our short term visibility into future revenues. Forecasting revenue in this environment is difficult. Our operating plan is for revenue to decline approximately 20% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We are planning to take steps to avoid a large inventory buildup by significantly reducing manufacturing output, which we expect will temporarily impact our gross margin by approximately 3 to 4 percentage points. We are therefore planning for gross margin to be approximately 57% to 58% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, depending on the actual product mix and level of sales we achieve. Further, we are planning to take actions in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 that we expect will result in operating expense reductions from fourth quarter levels of approximately 10%, or $25 million. We expect to realize over half of that savings in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and the balance in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result of these anticipated actions, we plan to record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently in the process of finalizing our plans to reduce costs and are unable to determine the amount of the restructuring charge at this point. Assuming these levels of sales and resulting gross margin, anticipated cost reductions, and an effective tax rate of 22%, we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 to be approximately $0.22 to $0.23, excluding restructuring charges. We are responding to the current economic environment by taking actions that we expect will reduce expenses in the short term while strengthening our position for the long term. We anticipate that our variable and discretionary cost reductions will fluctuate with general economic conditions, while the actions related to realigning our product 36 Table of Contents portfolio and streamlining our manufacturing infrastructure will result in short term savings as well as a lower cost structure. While we believe that we have taken steps to mitigate the short term reduction in our earnings and position ourselves for significant earnings leverage when growth resumes, there can be no assurances that market conditions will improve or that our actions will be sufficient to counteract those market conditions. New Accounting Pronouncements Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 161 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 161 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. The adoption of SFAS 161 will change our disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R requires an acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the acquisition. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which is our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 141R may have on our financial condition and results of operations. The adoption of SFAS 141R will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Noncontrolling Interests In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest and, accordingly, requires all entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which is our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 160 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Accounting for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB, issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which is our fiscal year 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 159 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also provides for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies 37 Table of Contents whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. This standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which is our fiscal year 2009. The adoption of SFAS 157 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 will not materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. The adoption of SFAS 157 will expand our disclosures pertaining to the measurement of assets and liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation We value inventories at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our 38 Table of Contents results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under SFAS 142, we utilize the entity wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On November 4, 2007 (the first day of our 2008 fiscal year), we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 differs from the prior standards in that it requires companies to determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Stock Based Compensation The adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 required that stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income, rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements. Determining the amount of stock based 39 Table of Contents compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant date fair values using the Black Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the markets current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in the Companys common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near the money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year. Expected term We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black Scholes grant date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant date fair value of the option. Risk free interest rate The yield on zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate. Expected dividend yield Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarters cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock based awards as of November 1, 2008. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes allegedly infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007, our annual interest income would change by approximately $14 million and $9 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007 would each change by approximately $2 million for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2i. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. We do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties, and limit the financial exposure with any one financial institution. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties. The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007: November 1, 2008 November 3, 2007 Fair value of forward exchange contracts (liability) asset $ (23,158 ) $ 6,924 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates (liability) asset $ (9,457 ) $ 24,414 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability $ (38,294 ) $ (9,233 ) The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 41 Table of Contents
