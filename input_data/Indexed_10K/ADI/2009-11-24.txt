MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including in particular the section entitled Outlook, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, continues, may, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections regarding our future financial performance, particularly in light of the ongoing global credit and financial market crisis; our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, our capital needs and capital expenditures; our market position and competitive changes in the marketplace for our products; our ability to innovate new products and technologies; the timing or the effectiveness of our efforts to refocus our operations and reduce our cost structure and the expected amounts of any cost savings related to those efforts; our ability to access credit or capital markets; our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock; our ability to service our outstanding debt; our expected tax rate; our third party suppliers; intellectual property and litigation matters; potential acquisitions or divestitures; key personnel; the effect of new accounting pronouncements and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10 K. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements except to the extent required by law. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities related to these businesses are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2009 and November 1, 2008. Unless otherwise noted, this Managements Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations. Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Total Revenue $ 2,014,908 $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 Gross Margin % 55.5 % 61.1 % 61.2 % Net income from Continuing Operations $ 247,408 $ 525,177 $ 502,123 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 12.3 % 20.3 % 20.4 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 0.85 $ 1.77 $ 1.51 Diluted EPS $ 0.85 $ 2.65 $ 1.50 The year to year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product. In fiscal year 2009, our revenue decreased 22% from fiscal 2008 and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by 52%. Our fiscal 2009 cash flow from operations was $432.1 million, or 21% of revenue. We received net proceeds of $370.4 million during fiscal 2009 from the issuance of long term debt and had $1,816 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments as of October 31, 2009. The global credit crisis and current economic conditions could continue to result in cautious customer spending behavior. We cannot predict the severity, duration or precise impact of the economic downturn on our 25 future financial results. Consequently, our reported results for the fiscal 2009 may not be indicative of our future results. Revenue Trends by End Market The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2009 2008 2007* % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue ** Revenue Revenue Industrial $ 1,049,158 52 % (24 )% $ 1,386,874 54 % $ 1,323,252 54 % Communications 512,941 25 % (13 )% 590,267 23 % 477,645 20 % Consumer 400,290 20 % (22 )% 512,339 20 % 523,793 22 % Computer 52,519 3 % (44 )% 93,451 4 % 105,031 4 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,014,908 100 % (22 )% $ 2,582,931 100 % $ 2,429,721 100 % Revenue from one time IP license 35,000 Total Revenue $ 2,014,908 $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 * The year ended November 3, 2007 was a 53 week year. We follow a 52 week, or 364 day fiscal calendar that results in a 53 week year approximately every seventh year, as occurred in fiscal 2007. ** The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. Industrial The year to year decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based decline in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation, automotive and process controls sectors of this end market. The year to year increase from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the instrumentation and automotive sectors and, to a lesser extent, the defense sector. The revenue growth in these sectors was partially offset by a decline in revenue from products used in automatic test equipment. Communications The year to year decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of analog products used in basestations, wireless handsets and networking applications. The year to year increase from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of revenue growth in sales of analog products used in basestations and wireless handsets. Consumer The year to year decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment, digital cameras and video game applications, consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending. The year to year decrease from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from advanced television and digital camera applications that was offset by a decline in revenue from other consumer applications, consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending. Computer The year to year decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in computer end market revenue was primarily the result of a general slowdown in the PC market. The year to year decrease from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of broad based declines in sales of our products into this end market. 26 Revenue from One Time IP License During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded revenue of $35 million received in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2009 2008 2007* % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue** Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue** Converters $ 960,502 48 % (19 )% $ 1,190,866 46 % $ 1,104,932 45 % Amplifiers 501,759 25 % (25 )% 665,585 26 % 618,267 25 % Other analog 261,059 13 % (18 )% 318,648 12 % 334,652 14 % Subtotal analog signal processing 1,723,320 86 % (21 )% 2,175,099 84 % 2,057,851 85 % Power management reference 118,247 6 % (18 )% 143,698 6 % 124,101 5 % Total analog products $ 1,841,567 91 % (21 )% $ 2,318,797 90 % $ 2,181,952 90 % General purpose DSP 167,133 8 % (29 )% 234,946 9 % 214,339 9 % Other DSP 6,208 0 % (79 )% 29,188 1 % 33,430 1 % Total DSP products $ 173,341 9 % (34 )% $ 264,134 10 % $ 247,769 10 % Total Product Revenue $ 2,014,908 100 % (22 )% $ 2,582,931 100 % $ 2,429,721 100 % Revenue from one time IP license 35,000 Total Revenue $ 2,014,908 $ 2,582,931 $ 2,464,721 * The year ended November 3, 2007 was a 53 week year. We follow a 52 week, or 364 day fiscal calendar that results in a 53 week year approximately every seventh year, as occurred in fiscal 2007. ** The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding. The decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 was due to declining demand across our product categories in every market that we serve, particularly the industrial and consumer end markets, as a result of an overall decline in the worldwide economy. The increase in revenue from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was the result of a broad based increase in sales across many of our product categories. The increase in sales of converters and amplifiers was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our products used in the industrial and communications end markets. 27 Revenue Trends by Geographic Region The percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three fiscal years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2009 2008 2007 United States 20 % 20 % 23 % Rest of North and South America 5 % 4 % 3 % Europe 25 % 26 % 24 % Japan 17 % 19 % 21 % China 19 % 16 % 13 % Rest of Asia 14 % 15 % 16 % In fiscal year 2009 the predominant countries comprising Rest of North and South America are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising Europe are Germany, Sweden and France; and the predominant countries comprising Rest of Asia are Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. In fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2007 the predominant countries comprising Rest of North and South America are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising Europe are Germany, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising Rest of Asia are Taiwan and Korea. Sales declined in all geographic regions in the fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, with sales in Europe and Japan experiencing the largest decline. This decline in sales in Europe was partially attributable to a decline in the automotive end market. The decline in sales in Japan was principally attributable to the general decline in consumer spending as a result of the global economic crisis. The decline in China was smaller than the decline in the other regions primarily due to the strong demand for our products used in Chinas recent infrastructure build out of the countrys next generation of communication technology. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Gross Margin $ 1,118,637 $ 1,577,275 $ 1,508,276 Gross Margin % 55.5 % 61.1 % 61.2 % Gross margin percentage was lower in fiscal 2009 by 560 basis points as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of a decrease in sales of $568.0 million and reduced operating levels in our manufacturing facilities that created adverse utilization variances. Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2008 was lower by 10 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of recording revenue in fiscal 2007 of $35 million we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. Stock based Compensation Expense As of October 31, 2009, the total compensation cost related to unvested equity awards not yet recognized in our statement of income was approximately $103.4 million (before tax consideration), which we will recognize over a weighted average period of 1.6 years. During fiscal 2009, our shareholders approved and we completed an employee stock option exchange program (Option Exchange). The Option Exchange provided our eligible employees, except our named executive officers and directors, the opportunity to exchange eligible stock option grants for a smaller number of new stock options, with a lower exercise price, or in some instances, cash, that had approximately the same fair value as the options surrendered. 28 See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information. Research and Development (RD) Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 RD Expenses $ 446,980 $ 533,480 $ 509,553 RD Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 22.2 % 20.7 % 21.0 % Research and development, or RD, expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased $86.5 million, or 16%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of the actions we took to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses. RD expenses in fiscal 2008 increased by $23.9 million, or 5%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary, benefit and variable compensation expenses, which were partially offset by one fewer week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 and lower employee stock option expenses. RD expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of RD projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to RD is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant RD investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMGA) Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 SMGA Expenses $ 333,184 $ 415,682 $ 389,505 SMGA Expenses as a % of Product Revenue 16.5 % 16.1 % 16.0 % Selling, marketing, general and administrative, or SMGA, expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased $82.5 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of our actions taken to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses. SMGA expenses increased by $26.2 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2008 as compared to the amount recorded in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary, benefit and variable compensation expenses, which were partially offset by lower employee stock option expenses and one less week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 also included $8.5 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in fiscal 2007. Special Charges Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale We ceased production at our California wafer fabrication facility in November 2006. We are paying the lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which expires in 2010. We completed the clean up activity during fiscal 2007, and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action. Reorganization of Product Development and Support Programs We recorded special charges in fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007 as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal processing product programs. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with these programs and 29 have paid all amounts owed to employees for severance. We do not expect to incur any further charges related to this reorganization action. Consolidation of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick In fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge of $13.7 million as a result of our decision to only use eight inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in Limerick. Certain manufacturing processes and products produced on the Limerick facilitys six inch production line have transitioned to our existing eight inch production line in Limerick while others have transitioned to external foundries. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees associated with this action. As of October 31, 2009, we still employed 2 of the 150 employees included in this action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. During fiscal 2008, we recorded an additional charge of $1.5 million related to this action, of which $1.2 million was an adjustment to the original estimate of the severance costs and $0.3 million was for clean up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred. During fiscal 2009, we recorded additional charges of $1.2 million for clean up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred. The production in the six inch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not expect to incur any further charges related to this action. We estimate that the closure of this facility will result in annual cost savings of approximately $25 million per year, which we expect to realize starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We expect these annual savings will be in cost of sales, of which approximately $1 million relates to non cash depreciation savings. Reduction of Overhead Infrastructure Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge as a result of our decision to either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus investments in products and end markets where we have better opportunities for profitable growth. In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset Business. As a result, we decided to reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing, engineering and SMGA to more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action and have paid all amounts owed to employees for severance. We do not expect to incur any further charges related to this action. These cost reduction actions, which were substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, resulted in annual savings of approximately $15 million. We realized these savings as follows: approximately $7 million in RD expenses, approximately $6 million in SMGA expenses and approximately $2 million in cost of sales. Reduction of Operating Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, in order to further reduce our operating cost structure, we recorded a special charge of $1.6 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 19 engineering and SMGA employees. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this charge and are paying amounts owed to employees for severance as income continuance. During fiscal 2009, we recorded an additional charge of $30.3 million related to this cost reduction action. Approximately $2.1 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009; approximately $0.9 million was for the write off of property, plant and equipment; and approximately $0.8 million was for contract termination costs and for clean up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred. The remaining $26.5 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations, for 245 manufacturing employees and 302 engineering and SMGA employees. As of October 31, 2009, we still employed 16 of the 547 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We believe this cost reduction action, which was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, will result in annual savings of approximately $36.4 million once fully implemented. We expect these annual savings will be realized as follows: approximately $31.6 million in SMGA expenses and approximately 30 $4.8 million in cost of sales. A portion of these savings is reflected in our results for fiscal year 2009 and the remainder of the savings will be fully reflected in our results by the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Cambridge During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a special charge of $22.1 million as a result of our decision to consolidate our Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility. In connection with the anticipated closure of this facility, we evaluated the recoverability of the facilities manufacturing assets and concluded that there was an impairment of approximately $12.9 million based on the revised period of intended use. The remaining $9.2 million was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan for 175 manufacturing employees and 9 SMGA employees associated with this action. We finished production in the Cambridge fabrication facility and began clean up activity during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we reversed approximately $1.8 million of the severance accrual. The accrual reversal was required because 51 employees either voluntarily left the Company or found alternative employment within the Company. In addition, we recorded a special charge of approximately $1.7 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets that were originally going to be moved to our other wafer fabrication facilities, but are no longer needed at those facilities and therefore have no future use. We also recorded a special charge of $0.1 million for clean up costs as we began our cleanup of the Cambridge fabrication facility at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As of October 31, 2009, we still employed 33 employees included in this action. The remaining employees will continue working during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 on the cleanup and closure of the wafer fabrication facility. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We expect to incur additional expenses, that cannot be precisely determined at this time, related to this action in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for lease termination, cleanup and closure costs. The lease charge will be taken when we cease using the building and the cleanup and closure costs will be expensed as incurred. We estimate that the closure of this facility will result in annual cost savings of approximately $41 million per year, expected to be fully realized starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We expect these annual savings to be realized as follows: approximately $40.2 million in cost of sales, of which approximately $4.0 million relates to non cash depreciation savings, and approximately $0.8 million in SMGA expenses. Operating Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Operating income from Continuing Operations $ 284,817 $ 625,025 $ 568,723 Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Total Revenue 14.1 % 24.2 % 23.1 % The $340.2 million, or 54%, decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of $568.0 million, a 560 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and an increase of $50.6 million in special charges. This decrease in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a decrease in RD and SMGA expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative. The $56.3 million, or 10%, increase in operating income in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in total revenue of $118.2 million and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in special charges of $37.4 million. This increase in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a 10 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage, an increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative, and the fact that fiscal 2007 included $35 million in non product revenue that we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales. 31 Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense 4,094 Interest income (15,621 ) (41,041 ) (77,007 ) Other, net (1,100 ) (36 ) (15,727 ) Total nonoperating income $ (12,627 ) $ (41,077 ) $ (92,734 ) Nonoperating income was lower by $28.5 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest income earned on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. In addition, we incurred interest expense during fiscal 2009 as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal 5.0% senior unsecured notes on June 30, 2009. We entered into an interest rate swap in June 2009 that swaps the fixed rate of the notes to a variable rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34% as of October 31, 2009). Nonoperating income in fiscal 2008 was lower by $51.7 million as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of lower average invested cash balances and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. In addition, other income in fiscal 2007 included $10.5 million we received as part of a litigation settlement and a $7.9 million gain from the sale of an investment. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Provision for Income Taxes $ 50,036 $ 140,925 $ 159,553 Effective Income Tax Rate 16.8 % 21.2 % 24.1 % Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was lower compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of our recording special charges of $53.7 million in fiscal 2009, a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate, and as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a lower rate. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was lower by 290 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007. The 2007 tax rate included the following transactions, which were taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate: the one time receipt of $35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party, $19 million we received from a settlement of litigation and a $7.9 million gain on the sale of an investment. In addition, the 2007 tax rate included tax expense related to the finalization of the accounting for a 2006 acquisition. These items, which had the effect of increasing the 2007 tax rate, were partially offset by a higher RD credit in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2008. In addition to these isolated transactions that impacted our tax rate, a larger percentage of our profits were earned in lower tax jurisdictions during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, causing a decrease in our tax rate. Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax $ 247,408 $ 525,177 $ 502,123 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax as a % of Total Revenue 12.3 % 20.3 % 20.4 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 0.85 $ 1.77 $ 1.51 32 Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2009 was lower than in fiscal 2008 by approximately $277.8 million primarily as a result of the $340.2 million decrease in operating income that was partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2009. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2008 was higher than in fiscal 2007 by approximately $23.1 million primarily as a result of the $56.3 million increase in operating income from continuing operations that was partially offset by a $51.7 million decrease in nonoperating income and a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2008. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Discontinued Operations Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 364 $ 12,779 $ (5,216 ) Gain on sale of Discontinued Operations, net of tax 248,328 Total income (loss) from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 364 $ 261,107 $ (5,216 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per share from Discontinued Operations $ 0.00 $ 0.88 $ (0.02 ) We sold our baseband chipset business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions In fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets associated with the support and customization of TTPComs GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future generations of SoftFone baseband processors. We also acquired development rights for AJAR, TTPComs advanced applications platform. As a result of this transaction, we became the single point of contact for both hardware and software support for our new and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving our ability to service the needs of individual customers. During fiscal 2007, we paid $6.1 million of contingent consideration related to this acquisition. In fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened our presence in the Asia region. We paid $8.4 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. We recorded these payments as additional goodwill. In fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing low power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid additional cash payments of $3.1 million during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of revenue based milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which were recorded as additional goodwill. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the acquisition documents, we paid $3.2 million during fiscal 2009 based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which were recorded as compensation expense in fiscal 2008. All revenue and technological milestones related to this acquisitions have been met and no additional payments will be made. We have not provided pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and AudioAsics in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. 33 Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 432,148 $ 669,368 $ 820,365 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Total Revenue 21.4 % 25.9 % 33.3 % At October 31, 2009, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1,816 million, an increase of $506.3 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2009 were net cash generated from operating activities of $432.1 million and net proceeds of $370.4 million from the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in June 2009. The principal uses of funds for fiscal 2009 were dividend payments of $233.0 million and capital expenditures of $56.1 million. We sold our baseband chipset business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cash flows from these discontinued operations have been combined with the operating, investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations (i.e. no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations) for all periods presented. We believe the absence of the cash flows from these discontinued operations has not and will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position. Additionally, as a result of these dispositions, we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations. See Note 2u. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding these discontinued operations. Fiscal Year 2009 2008 Accounts Receivable $ 301,036 $ 315,290 Days Sales Outstanding* 48 44 Inventory $ 253,161 $ 314,629 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory* 92 112 * We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory. Accounts receivable at October 31, 2009 decreased $14.3 million, or 5%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The decrease in receivables was the result of lower product shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Inventory at October 31, 2009 decreased by $61.5 million, or 20%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The decrease in inventory, despite a lower level of sales, is primarily a result of significant reductions in external manufacturing spending and additional factory shutdowns in fiscal 2009. Current liabilities decreased to $386.6 million at October 31, 2009, a decrease of $182.4 million, or 32%, from $569.1 million at the end of fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in accrued liabilities as a result of decreases in compensation and benefit accruals and to a lesser extent a decrease in income taxes payable as a result of lower profits in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Net additions to property, plant and equipment including discontinued operations, were $56.1 million in fiscal 2009, $157.4 million in fiscal 2008 and $141.8 million in fiscal 2007. We expect fiscal 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million. During fiscal 2009, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.80 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in aggregate dividend payments of $233.0 million. After the end of the fiscal year, on November 19, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 23, 2009 to shareholders of record on December 4, 2009 and is expected to total approximately $58.4 million. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. 34 Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $4 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 31, 2009, we had repurchased a total of approximately 114.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3,908.4 million under this program and an additional $91.6 million remains under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available to us in the United States. On June 30, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014 (the Notes) with annual interest payments of 5.0% paid in two installments on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010. The net proceeds of the offering were $370.4 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be amortized over the term of the Notes. We swapped the fixed interest portion of these Notes for a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34% as of October 31, 2009). The variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate are payable quarterly. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. In addition, we have a five year $165 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2013. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. At October 31, 2009, our principal source of liquidity was $1,816 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of October 31, 2009, approximately $412.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the United States, including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, by efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash, through borrowings under our current credit facility or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, our business strategies and operating results could be adversely affected. The volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions. However, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and purchases of stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. 35 The table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of October 31, 2009: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 80,782 $ 24,735 $ 27,905 $ 9,887 $ 18,255 Long term debt obligations 375,000 375,000 Interest payments associated with long term debt obligationsb 93,802 18,802 37,500 37,500 Payments due under interest rate swap agreementsc 42,447 8,935 17,894 15,618 Deferred compensation pland 7,940 1,363 6,577 Pension fundinge 30,050 30,050 Total $ 630,021 $ 83,885 $ 83,299 $ 438,005 $ 24,832 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These interest payments are expected to be offset by the proceeds from our interest rate swap agreements. (c) These interest payments are based on a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05%. The actual payments will be based on the LIBOR based rate which is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payments plus 2.05%. (d) These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the More than 5 Years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the More than 5 Years column of the table. All other columns represent installment payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are on long term disability, or as a result of elections made by plan participants under the provisions of our Deferred Compensation Plan. (e) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2010. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements. As of October 31, 2009, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $26.2 million, which are included in Other non current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table. 36 The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information. Off balance Sheet Financing As of October 31, 2009, we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us. We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to be approximately flat to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Our plan is for gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to increase to approximately 58.0% to 58.5% as a result of lower infrastructure costs and a richer mix of industrial sales. We are planning for operating expenses, excluding one time restructuring items associated with the closure of our Cambridge wafer fabrication facility, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to remain approximately flat to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, in line with our plan to achieve higher operating leverage going forward. As a result, our plan is for diluted EPS from continuing operations to be approximately $0.36 to $0.37 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, excluding one time restructuring items associated with the closure of our Cambridge wafer fabrication facility, which cannot be precisely determined at this time. New Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009 14 Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements (formerly EITF Issue No. 09 3). This standard removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance and also provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue guidance. More specifically, if the software sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential to the functionality of the tangible product, then this software, as well as undelivered software elements that relate to this software, are excluded from the scope of existing software revenue guidance. ASU No. 2009 14 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009 14 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009 13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (formerly EITF Issue No. 08 1). This standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements, such as product, software, services or support, to a customer at different times as part of a single revenue generating transaction. This standard provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables. The standard also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU No. 2009 13 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009 13 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. 37 Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS 167). SFAS 167 requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. Additionally, an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. SFAS 167 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2009, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 167 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Transfers of Financial Assets In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS 166). SFAS 166 changes the way entities account for securitizations and other transfers of financial instruments. SFAS 166 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2009, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 166 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 805 10 (formerly SFAS 141R, Business Combinations). ASC 805 10 requires an acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the acquisition. In April 2009, the FASB updated ASC 805 10 to amend the provisions for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations. This update also eliminates the distinction between contractual and non contractual contingencies. ASC 805 10 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which is our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that this rule may have on our financial condition and results of operations. The adoption of ASC 805 10 will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Noncontrolling Interests In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC810 10 (formerly SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements). ASC 810 10 clarifies that a noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest and, accordingly, requires all entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements. This topic is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which is our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that this rule may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until 38 the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation We value inventories at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The performance of the test involves a two step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 39 Accounting for Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On November 4, 2007 (the first day of our 2008 fiscal year), we adopted new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions. These principles requires companies to determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income. Determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant date fair values using the Black Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the markets current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near the money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year. 40 Expected term We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black Scholes grant date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant date fair value of the option. Risk free interest rate The yield on zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate. Expected dividend yield Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarters cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock based awards as of October 31, 2009. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. Contingencies From time to time, we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes allegedly infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of October 31, 2009 and November 1, 2008, our annual interest income would change by approximately $20 million and $14 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 31, 2009, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of November 1, 2008, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $2 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. In June 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $375 million 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014. The effect of the swap was to convert our 5.0% fixed 41 interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34% as of October 31, 2009). If LIBOR changes by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would change by $3.8 million. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2i. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 31, 2009 and November 1, 2008, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge a high proportion of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. We do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties. The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 31, 2009 and November 1, 2008: October 31, 2009 November 1, 2008 Fair value of forward exchange contracts asset (liability) $ 6,427 $ (23,158 ) Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset (liability) $ 20,132 $ (9,457 ) Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability $ (6,781 ) $ (38,294 ) The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 42
