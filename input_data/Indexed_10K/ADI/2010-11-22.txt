In addition, any statements that refer to projections regarding our future financial performance, particularly in light of the uncertainty remaining after the global credit and financial market crisis over the past two years; our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, our future capital needs and capital expenditures; our future market position and competitive changes in the marketplace for our products; our ability to innovate new products and technologies; the timing or the effectiveness of our continuing efforts to refocus our operations and reduce our cost structure and the expected amounts of any cost savings related to those efforts; our ability to access credit or capital markets; our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock; our ability to service our outstanding debt; our expected tax rate; the future actions of our third party suppliers; our reliance on assembly and test subcontractors, third party wafer fabricators and independent distributors; the expected outcomes of intellectual property and litigation matters; the ability to safeguard our patents and intellectual property; potential acquisitions or divestitures; the continued availability of key personnel; the global nature of our operations; the effect of new accounting pronouncements; and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10 K. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements except to the extent required by law. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The assets related to these businesses are reflected as non current assets of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2009. Unless otherwise noted, this Managements Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations. Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Revenue $ 2,761,503 $ 2,014,908 $ 2,582,931 Gross Margin % 65.2 % 55.5 % 61.1 % Net income from Continuing Operations $ 711,225 $ 247,408 $ 525,177 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue 25.8 % 12.3 % 20.3 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 2.33 $ 0.85 $ 1.77 Diluted EPS $ 2.33 $ 0.85 $ 2.65 The year to year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product. In fiscal 2010, our revenue increased 37% from fiscal 2009 and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.85 to $2.33. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2010 was $991.2 million, or 36% of revenue. In addition, we received $216.1 million in net proceeds related to employee stock option exercises, 26 Table of Contents distributed $250 million to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid $111.6 million for capital expenditures. These factors contributed to the net increase in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $871.8 million in fiscal 2010. The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was the result of a resurgence in economic activity from the low levels achieved during 2009 as a result of the general economic downturn following the global credit and financial crisis. The strategy we employed during the start of the economic downturn to be more focused on products and markets that value innovation and to make fundamental improvements to our cost structure aided in our growth. Improving macro trends in the industrial, communications, automotive and healthcare markets helped, and we believe will continue to help, to generate strong growth opportunities for us in the future. However, these trends remain uncertain and we cannot predict the sustainability of the current economic conditions. Consequently, our reported results for fiscal 2010 may not be indicative of our future results. Revenue Trends by End Market The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2010 2009 2008 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue* Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Industrial $ 1,266,423 46 % 48 % $ 857,950 43 % $ 1,143,333 44 % Automotive 333,045 12 % 66 % 200,989 10 % 255,172 10 % Consumer 513,348 19 % 23 % 417,652 21 % 538,202 21 % Communications 595,709 22 % 21 % 493,409 24 % 559,006 22 % Computer 52,978 2 % 18 % 44,908 2 % 87,218 3 % Total Revenue $ 2,761,503 100 % 37 % $ 2,014,908 100 % $ 2,582,931 100 % * The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. Industrial The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors. The year to year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based decline in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and process controls sectors. Automotive The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of increased demand due to various government initiated incentive programs, inventory replenishment and a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles. The year to year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in automotive end market revenue was primarily due to economic conditions relating to the global credit crisis resulting in cautious customer spending behavior. Consumer The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand for products used in digital cameras and other consumer applications. The year to year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment, digital cameras and video game applications, consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending. 27 Table of Contents Communications The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for the infrastructure sector. The year to year decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of analog products used in basestations, wireless handsets and networking applications. Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2010 2009 2008 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue* Revenue Revenue* Converters $ 1,286,344 47 % 29 % $ 999,227 50 % $ 1,235,378 48 % Amplifiers/Radio frequency 703,082 25 % 40 % 502,972 25 % 666,893 26 % Other analog 342,473 12 % 55 % 221,110 11 % 272,950 11 % Subtotal analog signal processing 2,331,899 84 % 35 % 1,723,309 86 % 2,175,221 84 % Power management reference 194,761 7 % 65 % 118,258 6 % 143,572 6 % Total analog products $ 2,526,660 91 % 37 % $ 1,841,567 91 % $ 2,318,793 90 % Digital signal processing 234,843 9 % 35 % 173,341 9 % 264,138 10 % Total Revenue $ 2,761,503 100 % 37 % $ 2,014,908 100 % $ 2,582,931 100 % * The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. The increase in total revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was the result of a broad based increase in sales across all of our product categories. The decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 was due to declining demand across our product categories in every market that we serve, particularly the industrial and consumer end markets, as a result of an overall decline in the worldwide economy. Revenue Trends by Geographic Region The percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three fiscal years is as follows: Fiscal Year Region 2010 2009 2008 United States 19 % 20 % 20 % Rest of North and South America 6 % 5 % 4 % Europe 25 % 25 % 26 % Japan 16 % 17 % 19 % China 18 % 19 % 16 % Rest of Asia 16 % 14 % 15 % 28 Table of Contents In fiscal year 2010 and 2009, the predominant countries comprising Rest of North and South America are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising Europe are Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising Rest of Asia are Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. In fiscal year 2008, the predominant countries comprising Rest of North and South America are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising Europe are Germany, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising Rest of Asia are Taiwan and South Korea. Sales increased in all geographic regions in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, with sales in Europe and the Rest of Asia experiencing the largest increases. The increase in sales was the result of an increase in demand for our products primarily as a result of improving economic conditions worldwide. Sales declined in all geographic regions in fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, with sales in Europe and Japan experiencing the largest decline. This decline in sales in Europe was partially attributable to a decline in the automotive end market. The decline in sales in Japan was principally attributable to the general decline in consumer spending as a result of the global economic crisis. The decline in China was smaller than the decline in the other regions primarily due to the strong demand for our products used in Chinas recent infrastructure build out of the countrys next generation of communication technology. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Gross Margin $ 1,799,422 $ 1,118,637 $ 1,577,275 Gross Margin % 65.2 % 55.5 % 61.1 % Gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal 2010 by 970 basis points as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of $746.6 million, increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of ongoing efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs, including the savings realized as a result of wafer fabrication facility consolidations. Additionally, a higher proportion of our revenues was from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market, which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets. Gross margin percentage was lower in fiscal 2009 by 560 basis points as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of a decrease in sales of $568.0 million and reduced operating levels in our manufacturing facilities that created adverse utilization variances. Research and Development (RD) Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 RD Expenses $ 492,305 $ 446,980 $ 533,480 RD Expenses as a % of Revenue 17.8 % 22.2 % 20.7 % Research and development, or RD, expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $45.3 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability, partially offset by the impact of actions we took over the past two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses. RD expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased $86.5 million, or 16%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of the actions we took to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses. RD expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of RD projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to RD is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our 29 Table of Contents existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore we expect to continue to make significant RD investments in the future. Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMGA) Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 SMGA Expenses $ 390,560 $ 333,184 $ 415,682 SMGA Expenses as a % of Revenue 14.1 % 16.5 % 16.1 % Selling, marketing, general and administrative, or SMGA, expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $57.4 million, or 17%, from fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability, and higher sales commission expenses, which are variable expenses linked to our sales. These increases were offset by the impact of actions we took over the past two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses. SMGA expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased $82.5 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of our actions taken to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses. Stock based Compensation Expense As of October 30, 2010, the total compensation cost related to unvested equity awards not yet recognized in our statement of income was approximately $95 million (before tax consideration), which we will recognize over a weighted average period of 1.4 years. During fiscal 2009, our shareholders approved and we completed an employee stock option exchange program (Option Exchange). The Option Exchange provided our eligible employees, excluding our named executive officers and directors, the opportunity to exchange eligible stock option grants for a smaller number of new stock options with a lower exercise price, or in some instances cash, that had approximately the same fair value as the options surrendered. See Note 3 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information on our stock based compensation. Special Charges The following is a summary of ongoing restructuring actions we have taken over the last several years. Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale We ceased production at our California wafer fabrication facility in November 2006. We paid the related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which expired in March 2010. We recorded a one time settlement charge of $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to the termination of the lease. This action was completed in fiscal 2010. Consolidation of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick In fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge of $13.7 million as a result of our decision to only use eight inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in Limerick. Certain manufacturing processes and products produced on the Limerick facilitys six inch production line have transitioned to our existing eight inch production line in Limerick while others have transitioned to external foundries. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees associated with this action. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with these programs and have paid out all amounts owed to employees as severance. During fiscal 2008, we recorded an additional charge of $1.5 million related to this action, of which $1.2 million was an adjustment to the original estimate of the severance costs and $0.3 million was for clean up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred. During fiscal 2009, we recorded additional charges of 30 Table of Contents $1.2 million for clean up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred. The production in the six inch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This action was completed in fiscal 2010. The closure of this facility resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $25 million per year, which we began realizing in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. These savings are recorded in cost of sales, of which approximately $1 million relates to non cash depreciation savings. Reduction of Operating Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, in order to further reduce our operating cost structure, we recorded a special charge of $1.6 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or the statutory requirements at foreign locations for 19 engineering, selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. During fiscal 2009, we recorded an additional charge of $30.3 million related to this cost reduction action. Approximately $2.1 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009; approximately $0.8 million was for the write off of property, plant and equipment no longer used as a result of this action; and approximately $0.5 million was for contract termination costs and approximately $0.3 million was for clean up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred. The remaining $26.6 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing employees and 302 engineering and SMGA employees. This cost reduction action, which was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, resulted in annual savings of approximately $36.4 million. These annual savings are being realized as follows: approximately $31.6 million in SMGA expenses and approximately $4.8 million in cost of sales. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded an additional charge of $11.4 million related to the further reduction of our operating cost structure. Approximately $10.9 million of this charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 149 engineering and SMGA employees. Approximately $0.5 million of the charge relates to our decision to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in power management, resulting in the impairment of related intellectual property. When fully implemented in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate that these cost reduction actions will result in annual savings of approximately $16 million. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action and are paying amounts owed to employees for severance as income continuance. Closure of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Cambridge During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a special charge of $22.1 million as a result of our decision to consolidate our Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility. In connection with the anticipated closure of this facility, we evaluated the recoverability of the facilitys manufacturing assets and concluded that there was an impairment of approximately $12.9 million based on the revised period of intended use. The remaining $9.2 million was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 175 manufacturing employees and 9 SMGA employees associated with this action. We finished production in the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility and began clean up activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we reversed approximately $1.8 million of our severance accrual. The accrual reversal was required because 51 employees either voluntarily left the Company or found alternative employment within the Company. In addition, we recorded a special charge of approximately $1.7 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets that were originally going to be moved to our other wafer fabrication facilities but are no longer needed at those facilities and therefore have no future use. We also recorded a special charge of $0.1 million for clean up costs as we began our clean up of the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this charge and are paying amounts owed to employees for severance as income continuance. We estimate that this action will result in annual cost savings of approximately $41 million per year, which we began realizing in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We expect these annual savings to be realized as follows: approximately $40.2 million 31 Table of Contents in cost of sales, of which approximately $4.0 million relates to non cash depreciation savings, and approximately $0.8 million relates to SMGA expenses. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded an additional charge of $4.7 million related to this cost reduction action. Approximately $3.4 million of the charge related to lease obligation costs for the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility, which we ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and the remaining $1.3 million of the charge related to clean up and closure costs. These cost reductions resulted in annual savings of approximately $2.4 million, which we began realizing in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Operating Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Operating income from Continuing Operations $ 900,074 $ 284,817 $ 625,025 Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue 32.6 % 14.1 % 24.2 % The $615.3 million, or 216%, increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $746.6 million, a 970 basis point increase in gross margin percentage, and lower special charges recorded in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The $340.2 million, or 54%, decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of $568.0 million, a 560 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and an increase of $50.6 million in special charges. This decrease in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a decrease in RD and SMGA expenses as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative. Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 10,429 $ 4,094 $ Interest income (9,837 ) (15,621 ) (41,041 ) Other, net (2,183 ) (1,100 ) (36 ) Total nonoperating income $ (1,591 ) $ (12,627 ) $ (41,077 ) Nonoperating income was lower by $11 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher interest expense incurred during fiscal 2010 as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal 5.0% senior unsecured notes on June 30, 2009 resulting in a partial year of interest expense in 2009 compared to a full year in 2010. In addition, we earned lower interest income on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Nonoperating income was lower by $28.5 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest income earned on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. In addition, we incurred interest expense during fiscal 2009 as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal 5.0% senior unsecured notes on June 30, 2009. We entered into an interest rate swap in June 2009 that swaps the fixed rate of the notes to a variable rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05%. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Provision for Income Taxes $ 190,440 $ 50,036 $ 140,925 Effective Income Tax Rate 21.1 % 16.8 % 21.2 % 32 Table of Contents Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was higher compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate. In addition, higher special charges recorded in fiscal 2009, a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate contributed to a higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was lower compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of our recording special charges of $53.7 million in fiscal 2009, a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate, and as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a lower rate. Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax $ 711,225 $ 247,408 $ 525,177 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax as a % of Revenue 25.8 % 12.3 % 20.3 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 2.33 $ 0.85 $ 1.77 Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2010 was higher than in fiscal 2009 by approximately $463.8 million primarily as a result of the $615.3 million increase in operating income that was partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal 2010. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2009 was lower than in fiscal 2008 by approximately $277.8 million primarily as a result of the $340.2 million decrease in operating income that was partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2009. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Discontinued Operations Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ $ 364 $ 12,779 Gain on sale of Discontinued Operations, net of tax 859 248,328 Total income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 859 $ 364 $ 261,107 Diluted earnings per share from Discontinued Operations $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.88 We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions In fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened our presence in the Asia region. We paid $8.4 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. We recorded these payments as additional goodwill. In fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing low power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid additional cash payments of 33 Table of Contents $3.1 million during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of revenue based milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which we recorded as additional goodwill. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the acquisition documents, we paid $3.2 million during fiscal 2009 based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which we recorded as compensation expense in fiscal 2008. All revenue and technological milestones related to this acquisition have been met and no additional payments will be made. We have not provided pro forma results of operations for Integrant and AudioAsics in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 991,175 $ 432,148 $ 669,368 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Revenue 35.9 % 21.4 % 25.9 % At October 30, 2010, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $2,687.8 million, an increase of $871.8 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2010 were net cash generated from operating activities of $991.2 million and $216.1 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The principal uses of funds for fiscal 2010 were dividend payments of $250.0 million and capital expenditures of $111.6 million. We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cash flows from these discontinued operations have been combined with the operating, investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations (i.e. no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations) for all periods presented. We believe the absence of the cash flows from these discontinued operations has not and will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position. Additionally, as a result of these dispositions, we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations. See Note 2u. in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding these discontinued operations. Fiscal Year 2010 2009 Accounts Receivable $ 387,169 $ 301,036 Days Sales Outstanding* 46 48 Inventory $ 277,478 $ 253,161 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory* 100 92 * We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory. Accounts receivable at October 30, 2010 increased $86.1 million, or 29%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The increase in receivables was the result of higher revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Inventory at October 30, 2010 increased by $24.3 million, or 10%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The increase in inventory relates primarily to an increase in manufacturing production to support higher sales demand. Current liabilities increased to $643.5 million at October 30, 2010, an increase of $256.9 million, or 66%, from $386.6 million at the end of fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher deferred income on shipments to distributors in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, and an increase in accrued liabilities relating to variable 34 Table of Contents compensation expense. In addition, income taxes payable increased in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of higher profits and a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate. Net additions to property, plant and equipment including discontinued operations were $111.6 million in fiscal 2010, $56.1 million in fiscal 2009 and $157.4 million in fiscal 2008. We expect fiscal 2011 capital expenditures to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. During fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.84 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in aggregate dividend payments of $250.0 million. After the end of fiscal 2010, on November 19, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 22, 2010 to shareholders of record on December 3, 2010 and is expected to total approximately $66 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.22 per share, although they remain subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $4 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 30, 2010, we had repurchased a total of approximately 116.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3,948.2 million under this program. As of October 30, 2010, an additional $51.8 million remained available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program. On November 19, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion of our common stock under our existing share repurchase program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options, or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted to our employees under our equity compensation plans. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the United States. On June 30, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014 (the Notes) with annual interest payments of 5.0% paid in two installments on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010. The net proceeds of the offering were $370.4 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be amortized over the term of the Notes. We swapped the fixed interest portion of these Notes for a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34% as of October 30, 2010). The variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate are payable quarterly. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party. In addition, we have a five year $165 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2013. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. At October 30, 2010, our principal source of liquidity was $2,687.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of October 30, 2010, approximately $725.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the United States, including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases. The volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets. While there are signs that conditions may be improving, there is no certainty that the current tentative recovery in credit and financial markets will continue. We are unable to predict the likely duration of the tentative 35 Table of Contents recovery in the credit and financial markets. However, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and purchases of stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of October 30, 2010: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 85,729 $ 21,871 $ 21,400 $ 11,803 $ 30,655 Long term debt obligations 375,000 375,000 Interest payments associated with long term debt obligationsb 75,000 18,750 37,500 18,750 Payments due under interest rate swap agreementsc 33,369 8,897 17,818 6,654 Deferred compensation pland 8,690 8,690 Pension fundinge 8,965 8,965 Total $ 586,753 $ 58,483 $ 76,718 $ 412,207 $ 39,345 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) These interest payments are expected to be offset by the proceeds from our interest rate swap agreements. (c) These interest payments are based on a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05%. The actual payments will be based on the LIBOR based rate which is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payments plus 2.05%. (d) These payments relate to obligations under our Deferred Compensation Plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the More than 5 Years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the More than 5 Years column of the table. (e) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2010. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements. As of October 30, 2010, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $28.3 million, which are included in Other non current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain 36 Table of Contents tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table. The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of October 30, 2010. Off balance Sheet Financing As of October 30, 2010, we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us. We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be in the range of $715 million to $740 million. Our plan is for gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be approximately 66%. We are planning for operating margins in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.5%. As a result, our plan is for diluted EPS from continuing operations to be approximately $0.63 to $0.67 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. New Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009 14 Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements (formerly EITF Issue No. 09 3). This standard removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance and also provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue guidance. More specifically, if the software sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential to the functionality of the tangible product, then this software, as well as undelivered software elements that relate to this software, are excluded from the scope of existing software revenue guidance. ASU No. 2009 14 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009 14 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009 13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (formerly EITF Issue No. 08 1). This standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements, such as product, software, services or support, to a customer at different times as part of a single revenue generating transaction. This standard provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables. The standard also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU No. 2009 13 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009 13 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Variable Interest Entities In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009 17 Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, which amends ASC 810, Consolidation. This standard requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable 37 Table of Contents interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. Additionally, an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. ASU No. 2009 17 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2009, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009 17 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Transfers of Financial Assets In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009 16, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, (Topic 820). This standard changes the way entities account for securitizations and other transfers of financial instruments. ASU No. 2009 16 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2009, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2009 16 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation We value inventories at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be 38 Table of Contents recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The performance of the test involves a two step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On November 4, 2007 (the first day of our 2008 fiscal year), we adopted new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions. These principles requires companies to determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on 39 Table of Contents factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income. Determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant date fair values using the Black Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the markets current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near the money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year. Expected term We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black Scholes grant date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant date fair value of the option. Risk free interest rate The yield on zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate. Expected dividend yield Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarters cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock based awards as of October 30, 2010. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. 40 Table of Contents Contingencies From time to time, we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009, our annual interest income would change by approximately $27 million and $18 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 30, 2010, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of October 31, 2009, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in approximately $3 million of incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. In June 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $375 million 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014. The effect of the swap was to convert our 5.0% fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34% as of October 30, 2010). If LIBOR changes by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $4 million. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2i. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately $6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows. The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. We do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties. 41 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009: October 30, 2010 October 31, 2009 Fair value of forward exchange contracts asset $ 7,256 $ 8,367 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset $ 22,062 $ 20,132 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability $ (7,396 ) $ (6,781 ) The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 42 Table of Contents
