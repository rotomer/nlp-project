ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts) During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, this Managements Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations. Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Revenue $ 2,993,320 $ 2,761,503 $ 2,014,908 Gross Margin % 66.4 % 65.2 % 55.5 % Net income from Continuing Operations $ 860,894 $ 711,225 $ 247,408 Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue 28.8 % 25.8 % 12.3 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 2.79 $ 2.33 $ 0.85 Diluted EPS $ 2.81 $ 2.33 $ 0.85 The year to year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product. During fiscal 2011, our revenue increased 8%, as compared to fiscal 2010. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.79 in fiscal 2011 from $2.33 in fiscal 2010. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011 was $900.5 million or 30% of revenue. We received proceeds of $515.5 million during fiscal 2011 from the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes and from a $145 million term loan facility entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. In addition, we received $217.2 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased a total of approximately 9.0 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $330.3 million, distributed $281.6 million to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid $123.0 million for property, plant and equipment additions. These factors contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $335.1 million in fiscal 2011. The year to year increase in revenue and profitability for fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of improved global macro economic conditions during the first half of the fiscal year. The strong growth we experienced in the first six months of fiscal 2011, including a 9% sequential revenue increase in our second fiscal quarter, was followed by sequential revenue declines in both the third and fourth fiscal quarters. The 9% sequential revenue increase in the second fiscal quarter included increased inventory stocking by our customers as a result of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. During the third and fourth quarters, of fiscal 2011, we began to see revenue declines attributable to inventory corrections following the inventory buildup in the prior quarters and declining demand as the deficit and credit related crisis in Europe and the U.S. caused customers to become more cautious in the second half of fiscal 2011. Revenue Trends by End Market The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. During fiscal year 2011, we consolidated the computer end market, which represented approximately 1% of fiscal 2011 revenue, into the consumer end market, and reclassified handset 27 revenue, which represented approximately 3% of fiscal 2011 revenue, from the communications end market to the consumer end market for all periods presented. 2011 2010 2009 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue* Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Industrial $ 1,397,634 47 % 10 % $ 1,267,736 46 % $ 860,696 43 % Automotive 415,444 14 % 25 % 333,644 12 % 200,329 10 % Consumer 586,945 20 % (6 )% 626,565 23 % 508,848 25 % Communications 593,297 20 % 11 % 533,558 19 % 445,035 22 % Total Revenue $ 2,993,320 100 % 8 % $ 2,761,503 100 % $ 2,014,908 100 % * The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. Industrial The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the automation and instrumentation sectors and, to a lesser extent, products sold into the energy and healthcare sectors. The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors. Automotive The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles and, to a lesser extent, a general increase in demand by our customers. The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of increased demand due to various government initiated incentive programs, inventory replenishment and a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles. Consumer The year to year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products in the digital camera and home entertainment sector primarily as a result of the impact of the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan in March 2011, partially offset by an increase in demand for products used in portable devices in this end market. The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand for products used in digital cameras and other consumer applications. Communications The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for the basestation end market sector. The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for the infrastructure sector. 28 Revenue Trends by Product The following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2011 2010 2009 % of % of % of Total Total Total Product Product Product Revenue Revenue Y/Y% Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue* Converters $ 1,343,492 45 % 4 % $ 1,295,678 47 % $ 1,005,004 50 % Amplifiers/Radio frequency 788,498 26 % 12 % 701,634 25 % 501,942 25 % Other analog 410,233 14 % 23 % 334,649 12 % 216,473 11 % Subtotal analog signal processing 2,542,223 85 % 9 % 2,331,961 84 % 1,723,419 86 % Power management reference 217,501 7 % 12 % 194,699 7 % 118,148 6 % Total analog products $ 2,759,724 92 % 9 % $ 2,526,660 91 % $ 1,841,567 91 % Digital signal processing 233,596 8 % (1 )% 234,843 9 % 173,341 9 % Total Revenue $ 2,993,320 100 % 8 % $ 2,761,503 100 % $ 2,014,908 100 % * The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. The increase in total revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 and from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was the result of a broad based increase in sales across all of our product categories. Revenue Trends by Geographic Region Revenue by geographic region, based upon customer location, for the last three fiscal years is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 United States $ 532,011 $ 508,187 $ 401,608 Rest of North and South America 164,079 153,962 92,954 Europe 838,719 703,717 502,602 Japan 400,456 441,826 349,907 China 596,433 508,489 376,080 Rest of Asia 461,622 445,322 291,757 Total revenue $ 2,993,320 $ 2,761,503 $ 2,014,908 In fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, the predominant countries comprising Rest of North and South America are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising Europe are Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising Rest of Asia are Taiwan and South Korea. Sales increased in all geographic regions, except Japan, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily as a result of increases in sales activity in the industrial, automotive and communications end market sectors. The year to year decrease in sales in Japan was primarily the result of lower sales activity in the consumer end market sector in this region due to the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan in March 2011. 29 Sales increased in all geographic regions in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, with sales in Europe and the Rest of Asia experiencing the largest increases. The increase in sales was the result of an increase in demand for our products primarily as a result of improving economic conditions worldwide. Gross Margin Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Gross Margin $ 1,986,541 $ 1,799,422 $ 1,118,637 Gross Margin % 66.4 % 65.2 % 55.5 % Gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal 2011 by 120 basis points, as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of $231.8 million, increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs, including the savings realized as a result of our wafer fabrication consolidation actions. Additionally, a higher proportion of our revenues were from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market, which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets. Gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal 2010 by 970 basis points as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of $746.6 million, increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of ongoing efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs, including the savings realized as a result of our wafer fabrication facility consolidations. Additionally, a higher proportion of our revenues were from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market, which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets. Research and Development (RD) Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 RD Expenses $ 505,570 $ 492,305 $ 446,980 RD Expenses as a % of Revenue 16.9 % 17.8 % 22.2 % RD expenses increased $13.3 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2011, increased headcount, and a general increase in spending. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth. Research and development, or RD, expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $45.3 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense, which was a variable expense linked to our overall profitability, partially offset by the impact of actions we took over the prior two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses. RD expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of RD projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, and we believe that a continued commitment to RD is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant RD investments in the future. 30 Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMGA) Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 SMGA Expenses $ 406,707 $ 390,560 $ 333,184 SMGA Expenses as a % of Revenue 13.6 % 14.1 % 16.5 % Selling, marketing, general and administrative, or SMGA, expenses increased $16.1 million, or 4%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2011, increased headcount and a general increase in spending. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth. SMGA expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $57.4 million, or 17%, from fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense, which was a variable expense linked to our overall profitability, and higher sales commission expenses, which are variable expenses linked to our sales. These increases were offset by the impact of actions we took over the prior two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses. Special Charges Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale We ceased production at our California wafer fabrication facility in November 2006. We paid the related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which expired in March 2010. We recorded a one time settlement charge of $0.4 million in fiscal 2010 related to the termination of the lease. This action was completed during fiscal 2010. Consolidation of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick During fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2010, we recorded special charges of $16.4 million as a result of our decision to only use eight inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in Limerick. These special charges included $14.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees and $1.5 million for clean up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred. The production in the six inch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This action was completed during fiscal 2010. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $25 million per year. Reduction of Operating Costs During fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010, in order to further reduce our operating cost structure, we recorded special charges of approximately $43.3 million. These special charges included: $39.1 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing employees and 470 engineering and SMGA employees; $2.1 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009; $0.8 million for the write off of property, plant and equipment; $0.5 million for contract termination costs; $0.3 million for clean up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred; and $0.5 million related to the impairment of intellectual property. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $52 million per year. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action and we are paying amounts owed to them as income continuance. During fiscal 2011, in order to further reduce our operating cost structure, we recorded a special charge of approximately $2.2 million. This special charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 engineering and SMGA employees. As of October 29, 2011, we still employed 13 of the 25 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We estimate this action will result in annual savings in SMGA expenses of approximately $4 million once fully implemented. 31 Closure of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Cambridge During fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, we recorded special charges of $26.8 million as a result of our decision to consolidate our Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility. These special charges included: $7.4 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 124 manufacturing employees and 9 SMGA employees; $14.6 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets; $3.4 million for lease obligation costs for the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility, which we ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal 2010; and $1.4 million for clean up and closure costs that we expensed as incurred. This action was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2011. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $43 million per year. Operating Income from Continuing Operations Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Operating income from Continuing Operations $ 1,072,025 $ 900,074 $ 284,817 Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue 35.8 % 32.6 % 14.1 % The $172.0 million, or 19%, increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $231.8 million and a 120 basis point increase in gross margin percentage. The $615.3 million, or 216%, increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $746.6 million, a 970 basis point increase in gross margin percentage, and lower special charges recorded in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Nonoperating (Income) Expense Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 19,146 $ 10,429 $ 4,094 Interest income (9,060 ) (9,837 ) (15,621 ) Other, net 492 (2,183 ) (1,100 ) Total nonoperating expense (income) $ 10,578 $ (1,591 ) $ (12,627 ) Nonoperating (income) expense was higher by $12.2 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense incurred as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes on April 4, 2011, and the $145 million term loan facility entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours in December 2010. In addition, we earned lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, which was partially offset by interest earned on higher cash balances in fiscal 2011. Nonoperating income was lower by $11 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense incurred during fiscal 2010 as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal 5.0% senior unsecured notes on June 30, 2009, resulting in a partial year of interest expense in 2009 compared to a full year in 2010. In addition, we earned lower interest income on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Provision for Income Taxes $ 200,553 $ 190,440 $ 50,036 Effective Income Tax Rate 18.9 % 21.1 % 16.8 % 32 Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was lower by 220 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010. The tax rate for fiscal 2011 included the following items which caused a decrease in our tax rate: the reinstatement of the federal RD tax credit in December 2010 retroactive to January 1, 2010, resulting in a $6.0 million income tax savings; a $6.7 million reduction in the state tax credit valuation reserve that we believe we can now recover; a $0.5 million tax benefit from the increase in Irish deferred taxes as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%; and a net $10.8 million tax benefit related to the settlement with the Appeals Office of the Internal Revenue Service of certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. Fiscal 2010 also included a higher special charge, a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate as compared to the special charge recorded in fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was higher compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate. In addition, higher special charges recorded in fiscal 2009, a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate, contributed to a higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax $ 860,894 $ 711,225 $ 247,408 Income from Continuing Operations, net of tax as a % of Revenue 28.8 % 25.8 % 12.3 % Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 2.79 $ 2.33 $ 0.85 Net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 was higher than in fiscal 2010 by approximately $149.7 million primarily as a result of the $172.0 million increase in operating income from continuing operations, offset by lower nonoperating income and a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2010 was higher than in fiscal 2009 by approximately $463.8 million primarily as a result of the $615.3 million increase in operating income that was partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal 2010. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant. Discontinued Operations Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ $ $ 364 Gain on sale of Discontinued Operations, net of tax 6,500 859 Total income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax $ 6,500 $ 859 $ 364 Diluted earnings per share from Discontinued Operations $ 0.02 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions In fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened our 33 presence in the Asia region. We paid $8.4 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. We recorded these payments as additional goodwill. In fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of privately held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allowed us to continue developing low power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid additional cash payments of $3.1 million during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of revenue based milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which we recorded as additional goodwill. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the acquisition documents, we paid $3.2 million during fiscal 2009 based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which we recorded as compensation expense in fiscal 2008. All revenue and technological milestones related to this acquisition have been met and no additional payments will be made. In fiscal 2011, we acquired privately held Lyric Semiconductor, Inc. (Lyric) of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The acquisition of Lyric gives us the potential to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency in mixed signal processing. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $27.8 million, which consisted of $14.0 million in initial cash payments at closing and contingent consideration of up to $13.8 million. The contingent consideration arrangement requires additional cash payments to the former equity holders of Lyric upon the achievement of certain technological and product development milestones payable during the period from June 2011 through June 2016. As of October 29, 2011, no contingent payments have been made and the fair value of the contingent consideration was approximately $14.0 million. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $12.2 million of in process research and development, $18.9 million of goodwill and $3.3 million of net deferred tax liabilities. In addition, we will be obligated to pay royalties to the former equity holders of Lyric on revenue recognized from the sale of Lyric products and licenses through the earlier of 20 years or the accrual of a maximum of $25 million. Royalty payments to Lyric employees require post acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods. As of October 29, 2011, no royalty payments have been made. We recognized $0.2 million of acquisition related costs that we expensed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. These costs are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income. We have not provided pro forma results of operations for Integrant, AudioAsics and Lyric in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 900,529 $ 991,175 $ 432,148 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Revenue 30.1 % 35.9 % 21.4 % At October 29, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,405.1 million. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2011 were net cash generated from operating activities of $900.5 million, proceeds of $515.5 million relating to the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 and the $145 million term loan facility we entered into through a wholly owned subsidiary. In addition, we received $217.2 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The principal uses of funds for fiscal 2011 were the repurchase of approximately 9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $330.3 million, 34 dividend payments of $281.6 million and additions to property, plant and equipment of $123.0 million. These factors contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $335.1 million in fiscal 2011. Fiscal Year 2011 2010 Accounts Receivable $ 348,416 $ 387,169 Days Sales Outstanding* 44 46 Inventory $ 295,081 $ 277,478 Days Cost of Sales in Inventory* 105 100 * We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory. Accounts receivable at October 29, 2011 decreased $38.8 million, or 10%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The decrease in receivables was primarily the result of lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Days sales outstanding decreased by two days as a result of lower product shipments in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Inventory at October 29, 2011 increased by $17.6 million, or 6%, from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The increase in inventory relates primarily to an increase in manufacturing production to support the higher revenue levels recorded in fiscal 2011. Days cost of sales in inventory increased five days primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, which resulted in cost of sales increasing only 1% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to a 6% increase in inventory during this same time period. Current liabilities decreased to $525.0 million at October 29, 2011, a decrease of $118.5 million, or 18%, from $643.5 million at the end of fiscal 2010. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income tax payable as a result of the settlement with the Appeals Office of the Internal Revenue Service of certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. In addition, accrued liabilities declined as a result of a decrease in accruals related to variable compensation expense. As of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, we had gross deferred revenue of $311.3 million and $327.2 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $78.1 million and $84.4 million, respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors decreased by approximately $9.6 million in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the distributors sales to their customers in fiscal 2011 exceeding our shipments to our distributors during this same time period. Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers. The amount of price adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $123.0 million in fiscal 2011 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $100 million to $125 million in fiscal 2012 to be used primarily in our manufacturing facilities. During fiscal 2011, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends totaling $0.94 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in aggregate dividend payments of $281.6 million. After the end of fiscal 2011, on November 18, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on December 21, 2011 to shareholders of record on December 2, 2011 and is expected to total approximately $75 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.25 per share, 35 although they remain subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 29, 2011, we had repurchased a total of approximately 125.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4,278.5 million under this program. As of October 29, 2011, an additional $721.5 million remained available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options, or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted to our employees under our equity compensation plans. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the United States. On June 30, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014 (the 5.0% Notes) with annual interest payments of 5.0% paid in two installments on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010. The net proceeds of the offering were $370.4 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be amortized over the term of the 5.0% Notes. We swapped the fixed interest portion of these Notes for a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.42% as of October 29, 2011). The variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate are payable quarterly. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. The indenture governing the 5.0% Notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party. As of October 29, 2011, we were compliant with these covenants. On December 22, 2010, Analog Devices Holdings B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., London Branch as administrative agent. The borrowers obligations are guaranteed by us. The credit agreement provides for a term loan facility of $145 million, which matures on December 22, 2013. The terms of the agreement provide for a three year principal amortization schedule with $3.6 million payable quarterly every March, June, September and December with the balance payable upon the maturity date. During the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we made an additional principal payment of $17.5 million. The loan will bear interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the LIBOR rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of 1.25% (1.61% as of October 29, 2011). The terms of this facility include limitations on subsidiary indebtedness and on liens against our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, and also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of October 29, 2011, we were compliant with these covenants. The proceeds of this loan are being used to restructure our captive finance subsidiaries. On April 4, 2011, we issued $375 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 (the 3.0% Notes) with semi annual fixed interest payments due on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2011. The net proceeds of the offering were $370.5 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be amortized over the term of the 3.0% Notes. The indenture governing the 3.0% Notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of October 29, 2011, we were compliant with these covenants. In addition, we have a five year $165 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2013. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, 36 working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of this facility also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of October 29, 2011, we were compliant with these covenants. At October 29, 2011, our principal source of liquidity was $3,592.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, of which approximately $1,170.5 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the United States, including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition and our short term investments consist primarily of liquid money market funds and corporate obligations, such as commercial paper, bonds and bank time deposits. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and repurchases of our stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of October 29, 2011: Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Contractual obligations: Operating leasesa $ 66,055 $ 17,590 $ 19,675 $ 9,318 $ 19,472 Long term debt obligations 866,608 14,500 477,108 375,000 Interest payments associated with long term debt obligationsb 110,599 31,808 61,916 16,875 Payments due under interest rate swap agreementsc 25,281 9,184 16,097 Deferred compensation pland 26,410 26,410 Pension fundinge 3,673 3,673 Total $ 1,098,626 $ 76,755 $ 574,796 $ 401,193 $ 45,882 (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table. (b) The interest payments related to our 5% senior unsecured notes are expected to be fully offset by the proceeds from our interest rate swap agreements. The interest payments related to our term loan facility are based on LIBOR plus a spread of 1.25% (1.61% as of October 29, 2011). The actual payments will be based on the LIBOR rate corresponding to the tenor of the interest period chosen, plus a spread of 1.25% which is set two business days prior to the start of the new interest period. (c) These interest payments are based on a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.42% as of October 29, 2011). The actual payments will be based on the LIBOR based rate which is set quarterly three months prior to the due date of the interest payments plus 2.05%. (d) These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the More than 5 Years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for 37 participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the More than 5 Years column of the table. (e) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2012. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements. Our 2011 acquisition of Lyric Semiconductor involves the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information regarding our acquisitions. As of October 29, 2011, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $20.8 million, which are included in Other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table. The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of October 29, 2011. Off balance Sheet Financing As of October 29, 2011, we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements. Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us. We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be down approximately 5% to 10% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our plan is for gross margin percentage for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be approximately 63.0% plus or minus 50 basis points. We are planning for operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $226 million to $229 million. As a result, our plan is for diluted EPS to be approximately $0.44 to $0.51 in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. New Accounting Pronouncements Standards Implemented Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009 13 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (formerly EITF Issue No. 08 1) (ASU No. 2009 13). This standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements, such as product, software, services or support, to a customer at different 38 times as part of a single revenue generating transaction. This standard provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables. The standard also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU No. 2009 13 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. The adoption of ASU 2009 13 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 did not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Standards to be Implemented Business Combinations In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010 29, Business Combinations (ASC Topic 805) Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations (ASU No. 2010 29). ASU No. 2010 29 requires a public entity to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior year. It also requires a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported revenue and earnings. The new disclosure will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal year 2012. The adoption of ASU No. 2010 29 will require additional disclosure in the event of a business combination but will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Intangibles Goodwill and Other In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010 28, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (ASC Topic 350) (ASU No. 2010 28). ASU No. 2010 28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. ASU 2010 28 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2012. We do not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2010 28 to impact our financial condition and results of operations. Fair Value Measurement In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU No. 2011 04). ASU No. 2011 04 amended ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to converge the fair value measurement guidance in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). Some of the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements, while other amendments change a particular principle in ASC 820. In addition, ASU No. 2011 04 requires additional fair value disclosures. The amendments are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, which is our second quarter of fiscal year 2012. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2011 04 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU No. 2011 05). ASU No. 2011 05 amended ASC 320, Comprehensive Income, to converge the presentation of comprehensive income between U.S GAAP and IFRS. ASU No. 2011 05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements and also requires reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. ASU No. 2011 05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. ASU 2011 05 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, which is our fiscal year 39 2013. The adoption of ASU No. 2011 05 will affect the presentation of comprehensive income but will not impact our financial condition or results of operations. Intangibles Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (ASC Topic 350): Testing for Goodwill Impairment (ASU No. 2011 08). ASU No. 2011 08 provides a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of certain conditions leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, a company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. However, if a company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. ASU No. 2011 08 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2011, which is our fiscal year 2013. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU No. 2011 08 may have on our financial condition and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Inventory Valuation We value inventories at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are 40 expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. For our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred on July 31, 2011, we identified our reporting units to be our five operating segments, which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment. The performance of the test involves a two step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Value of Contingent Consideration related to Business Combination We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period. Accounting for Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the 41 uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income. Determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant date fair values using the Black Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions: Expected volatility We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the markets current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near the money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year. Expected term We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black Scholes grant date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant date fair value of the option. Risk free interest rate The yield on zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate. 42 Expected dividend yield Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarters cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock based awards as of October 29, 2011. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. Contingencies From time to time, we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value of our investments, debt and interest rate swap agreement. Based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, our annual interest income would change by approximately $38 million and $27 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4 million decline in each year in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. As of October 29, 2011, we had $750 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which consisted of $375 million 5% senior unsecured notes, due July 1, 2014 and $375 million 3% senior unsecured notes, due April 15, 2016. As of October 29, 2011, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our $375 million of 3% senior unsecured notes outstanding by approximately $16 million. As of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010 a similar increase in market interest rates would not change the fair value of our $375 million 5% senior unsecured notes which have been hedged by an interest rate swap agreement. Any changes to fair value of the 5% senior unsecured notes would be offset by the change in the fair value of the corresponding interest rate swap. 43 We hold an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $375 million 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014. The effect of the swap is to convert our 5.0% fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.42% as of October 29, 2011). In addition, we have a term loan facility of $145 million that bears interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the LIBOR rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of 1.25% (1.61% as of October 29, 2011). If LIBOR increases by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $5 million. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our $375 million of 3% fixed rate debt, which is not hedged. As of October 30, 2010, a similar 100 basis point increase in LIBOR would have resulted in an increase of approximately $4 million to our annual interest expense. Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note 2i in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately $6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows. The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of October 29, 2011, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties. The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010: October 29, 2011 October 30, 2010 Fair value of forward exchange contracts asset $ 2,472 $ 7,256 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset $ 17,859 $ 22,062 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability $ (13,332 ) $ (7,396 ) The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. 44
