ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts)During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, this Managements Discussion and Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations.Results of OperationsOverview Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeRevenue$2,701,142 $2,993,320 $2,761,503 $(292,178) (10)% $231,817 8%Gross Margin %64.5% 66.4% 65.2% Net income from Continuing Operations$651,236 $860,894 $711,225 $(209,658) (24)% $149,669 21%Net income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue24.1% 28.8% 25.8% Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations$2.13 $2.79 $2.33 $(0.66) (24)% $0.46 20%Diluted EPS$2.13 $2.81 $2.33 $(0.68) (24)% $0.48 21%Fiscal 2012 was a 53 week year. Fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were 52 week years. The additional week in fiscal 2012 was included in the first quarter ended February 4, 2012.The year to year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under Revenue Trends by End Market and Revenue Trends by Product Type.During fiscal 2012, our revenue decreased 10% compared to fiscal 2011. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased to $2.13 in fiscal 2012 from $2.79 in fiscal 2011. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 was $814.5 million, or 30.2% of revenue. During fiscal 2012, we received $191.2 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises, repurchased a total of approximately 4.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $160.5 million, distributed $344.7 million to our shareholders in dividend payments, paid $56.5 million in principal payments related to our $145.0 million term loan facility, paid $132.2 million for property, plant and equipment additions and paid $24.2 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Multigig. In addition, we paid $1,183.5 million for the net purchase of short term available for sale investments. These factors contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $876.3 million in fiscal 2012.The year to year decrease in revenue and profitability for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of continued slowdown in the growth of the global economy. Our customers were increasingly cautious through the year and reduced the inventory levels of our products. We believe that our variable cost structure and continued efforts to manage production, inventory levels and expenses helped to mitigate the effect that these lower sales levels had on our earnings.26Revenue Trends by End MarketThe following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market. 2012 2011 2010 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenueIndustrial$1,240,344 46% (12)% $1,411,386 47% $1,280,027 46%Automotive463,577 17% 11 % 417,929 14% 335,163 12%Consumer467,626 17% (16)% 559,142 19% 605,541 22%Communications529,595 20% (12)% 604,863 20% 540,772 20%Total Revenue$2,701,142 100% (10)% $2,993,320 100% $2,761,503 100%Industrial The year to year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based decrease in demand in this end market related to ongoing global macro economic weakness. The year to year decrease was most significant for products sold into the industrial automation and instrumentation sectors. The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the automation and instrumentation sectors and, to a lesser extent, products sold into the energy and healthcare sectors. Automotive The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of an increase in the electronic content in automobiles used in infotainment applications and to a lesser extent in power train and safety applications and a general increase in demand by our customers. The year to year increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles and, to a lesser extent, a general increase in demand by our customers. Consumer The year to year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad based decrease in demand for products sold in this end market. The year to year decrease in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products in the digital camera and home entertainment sector primarily as a result of the impact of the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan in March 2011, partially offset by an increase in demand for products used in portable devices in this end market. Communications The year to year fluctuations in communications end market revenue for the years presented are primarily the result of broad based demand shifts in this end market, which were most significant for products sold into the wireless base station end market sector.27Revenue Trends by Product TypeThe following table summarizes revenue by product categories. The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories, we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category. 2012 2011 2010 Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue* Y/Y% Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenue Revenue % ofTotalProductRevenueConverters$1,192,064 44% (11)% $1,343,487 45% $1,295,700 47%Amplifiers/Radio frequency697,687 26% (11)% 788,299 26% 701,557 25%Other analog397,376 15% (3)% 410,323 14% 334,663 12%Subtotal analog signal processing2,287,127 85% (10)% 2,542,109 85% 2,331,920 84%Power management & reference182,134 7% (16)% 217,615 7% 194,740 7%Total analog products$2,469,261 91% (11)% $2,759,724 92% $2,526,660 91%Digital signal processing231,881 9% (1)% 233,596 8% 234,843 9%Total Revenue$2,701,142 100% (10)% $2,993,320 100% $2,761,503 100% *The sum of the individual percentages do not equal the total due to rounding. The year to year fluctuations in total revenue for the years presented were the result of a broad based demand shift across all product categories.Revenue Trends by Geographic RegionDuring fiscal year 2012 we changed our method for classifying revenue by geographic region to more accurately reflect the primary location of our customers design activity for our products. Prior periods have been reclassified to align with this definition. In general, the prior classification method reflected the customers manufacturing location or the distributors stocking territory. No changes have been made to our revenue recognition policy. A breakdown of our fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 revenue by geographic location follows.

The year to year decrease in sales in Japan and Rest of Asia was primarily the result of lower sales activity in the consumer end market sector in this region due to the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan in March 2011.Gross Margin Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeGross Margin$1,741,001 $1,986,541 $1,799,422 $(245,540) (12)% $187,119 10%Gross Margin %64.5% 66.4% 65.2% Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2012 decreased 190 basis points compared to fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of decreased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities as well as a reduced percentage of sales of our products sold into the industrial automation and instrumentation sectors of the industrial end market and the wireless base station sector of the communications end market, which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end market sectors.Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2011 increased 120 basis points compared to fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of $231.8 million, increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs, including the savings realized as a result of our wafer fabrication consolidation actions. Additionally, a higher proportion of our revenues were from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market, which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets.Research and Development (R&D) Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeR&D Expenses$512,003 $505,570 $492,305 $6,433 1% $13,265 3%R&D Expenses as a % of Revenue19.0% 16.9% 17.8% R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of annual salary increases that became effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and a general increase in spending, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense, which is linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, increased headcount, and a general increase in spending. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We have hundreds of R&D projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.29Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeSMG&A Expenses$396,519 $406,707 $390,560 $(10,188) (3)% $16,147 4%SMG&A Expenses as a % of Revenue14.7% 13.6% 14.1% SMG&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as lower variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, was partially offset by annual salary increases that became effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012.SMG&A, expenses increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, increased headcount and a general increase in spending. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth.Special ChargesWe monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years. The expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below.Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility in SunnyvaleWe ceased production at our California wafer fabrication facility in November 2006. We paid the related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which expired in March 2010. We recorded a one time settlement charge of $0.4 million in fiscal 2010 related to the termination of the lease. This action was completed during fiscal 2010.Reduction of Operating CostsDuring fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010, we recorded special charges of approximately $43.3 million. These special charges included: $39.1 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing employees and 470 engineering and SMG&A employees; $2.1 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009; $0.8 million for the write off of property, plant and equipment; $0.5 million for contract termination costs and $0.3 million for clean up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred; and $0.5 million related to the impairment of intellectual property. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $52.0 million per year. We have terminated the employment of all employees associated with these actions. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a special charge of approximately $2.2 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 engineering and SMG&A employees. This action was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $4.0 million.During fiscal 2012, we recorded special charges of approximately $8.4 million. The special charge included $7.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 95 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees; $0.1 million for contract termination costs; $0.2 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and $0.2 million for the write off of property, plant and equipment. As of November 3, 2012, we employed 6 of the 95 employees included in this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We estimate this action will result in annual savings in SMG&A expenses of approximately $12.0 million once fully implemented.30Closure of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in CambridgeDuring fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, we recorded special charges of $26.8 million as a result of our decision to consolidate our Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility. These special charges included: $7.4 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 124 manufacturing employees and 9 SMG&A employees; $14.6 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets; $3.4 million for lease obligation costs for the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility, which we ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal 2010; and $1.4 million for clean up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred. This action was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2011. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $43 million per year.Operating Income from Continuing Operations Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeOperating income from Continuing Operations$824,048 $1,072,025 $900,074 $(247,977) (23)% $171,951 19%Operating income from Continuing Operations as a % of Revenue30.5% 35.8% 32.6% The year over year decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of $292.2 million and a 190 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage.The increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $231.8 million and a 120 basis point increase in gross margin percentage.Nonoperating (Income) Expense Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change $ ChangeInterest expense$26,422 $19,146 $10,429 $7,276 $8,717Interest income(14,448) (9,060) (9,837) (5,388) 777Other, net(1,459) 492 (2,183) (1,951) 2,675Total nonoperating expense (income)$10,515 $10,578 $(1,591) $(63) $12,169The year over year increase in nonoperating interest expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily a result of our issuance of $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes on April 4, 2011 which was partially offset by the impact of the termination of our interest rate swap agreement more fully described below under the heading Debt. The increases were partially offset by an increase in nonoperating interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and the investment of higher cash balances in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, and an increase in nonoperating other income as a result of the gain from the sale of other investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.The year over year increase in nonoperating expense (income) in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense incurred as a result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes on April 4, 2011, and the $145 million term loan facility entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours in December 2010. In addition, we earned lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, which was partially offset by interest earned on higher cash balances in fiscal 2011.31Provision for Income Taxes Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeProvision for Income Taxes$162,297 $200,553 $190,440 $(38,256) (19)% $10,113 5%Effective Income Tax Rate19.9% 18.9% 21.1% Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 increased 100 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 due to the expiration of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in December 2011. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 decreased 220 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 due to the impact of several discrete tax items. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 included the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit in December 2010 retroactive to January 1, 2010, resulting in a $6.0 million income tax savings; a $6.7 million reduction in the state tax credit valuation reserve; a $0.5 million tax benefit from the increase in Irish deferred taxes as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%; and a net $10.8 million tax benefit related to the settlement with the Appeals Office of the Internal Revenue Service of certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years.

Accordingly, the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements.32AcquisitionsIn fiscal 2012, we acquired privately held Multigig, Inc. (Multigig) of San Jose, California. The acquisition of Multigig is expected to enhance our clocking capabilities in stand alone and embedded applications and strengthen our high speed signal processing solutions. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $26.8 million, which consisted of $24.2 million in initial cash payments at closing and an additional $2.6 million subject to an indemnification holdback that is payable within 15 months of the transaction date, which is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of November 3, 2012. Our assessment of fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $15.6 million of in process research and development (IPR&D), $1.1 million of developed technology, $7.0 million of goodwill and $3.1 million of net deferred tax assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we reduced the indemnification holdback amount by $0.1 million as a result of indemnification claims. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we finalized our purchase accounting for Multigig which resulted in adjustments of $0.4 million to deferred taxes and goodwill. In addition, we will be obligated to pay royalties to the Multigig employees on revenue recognized from the sale of certain Multigig products through the earlier of 5 years or the aggregate maximum payment of $1.0 million. Royalty payments to Multigig employees require post acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods. As of November 3, 2012, no royalty payments have been made. We recognized $0.5 million of acquisition related costs that were expensed in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, which were included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.In fiscal 2011, we acquired privately held Lyric Semiconductor, Inc. (Lyric) of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The acquisition of Lyric gives us the potential to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency in mixed signal processing. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $27.8 million, which consisted of $14.0 million in initial cash payments at closing and contingent consideration of up to $13.8 million. The contingent consideration arrangement requires additional cash payments to the former equity holders of Lyric upon the achievement of certain technological and product development milestones payable during the period from June 2011 through June 2016. As of November 3, 2012, we paid $2.0 million in contingent consideration. The payment is reflected in the statements of cash flows as cash used in financing activities related to the liability recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and cash provided by operating activities related to the fair value adjustments previously recognized in earnings. The fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was approximately $12.2 million of IPR&D as of November 3, 2012, of which $6.8 million is included in accrued liabilities and $5.4 million is included in other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $12.2 million of in process research and development, $18.9 million of goodwill and $3.3 million of net deferred tax liabilities. In addition, we will be obligated to pay royalties to the former equity holders of Lyric on revenue recognized from the sale of Lyric products and licenses through the earlier of 20 years or the accrual of a maximum of $25.0 million. Royalty payments to Lyric employees require post acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods. As of November 3, 2012, no royalty payments have been made. We recognized $0.2 million of acquisition related costs that we expensed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. These costs are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.We have not provided pro forma results of operations for Multigig and Lyric in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt November 3, 2012, our principal source of liquidity was $3,900.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, of which approximately $1,105.8 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend toreinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the United States, including cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition, including money market funds, and our short term investments consist primarily of corporate obligations, such as commercial paper and floating rate notes, bonds and bank time deposits. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and repurchases of our stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.33 Change Fiscal Year 2012 over 2011 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % ChangeNet Cash Provided by Operations$814,542 $900,529 $991,175 $(85,987) (10)% $(90,646) (9)%Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Revenue30.2% 30.1% 35.9% At November 3, 2012, cash and cash equivalents totaled $528.8 million. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2012 were net cash generated from operating activities of $814.5 million. In addition, we received $191.2 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The principal uses of funds for fiscal 2012 were the repurchase of approximately 4.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $160.5 million, dividend payments of $344.7 million, principal payments of $56.5 million related to our $145 million term loan facility, additions to property, plant and equipment of $132.2 million and payments of $24.2 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Multigig. In addition, we paid $1,183.5 million for the net purchase of short term available for sale investments. These factors contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $876.3 million in fiscal 2012.Working Capital Fiscal Year 2012 2011 $ Change% ChangeAccounts Receivable$339,881 $348,416 $(8,535)(2)%Days Sales Outstanding*45 44 Inventory$313,723 $295,081 $18,6426 %Days Cost of Sales in Inventory*114 105 *We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales in inventory.The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Days sales outstanding increased as a result of higher product shipments made to our distributors in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.Inventory as of November 3, 2012 increased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as a result of an increase in manufacturing production to support anticipated higher sales demand. Days cost of sales in inventory increased primarily due to lower manufacturing costs which resulted in cost of sales decreasing 2% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. In addition, inventory levels increased by 6% for the same period.Current liabilities of $525.1 million at November 3, 2012, remained flat to the $525.0 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2011, as an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors, net, which is more fully described below and an increase in accounts payable was offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities as a result of lower variable compensation expense accruals. As of November 3, 2012 and October 29, 2011, we had gross deferred revenue of $299.0 million and $309.6 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $60.5 million and $76.4 million, respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products in the channel. Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers. The amount of price adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions.34 DebtAs of November 3, 2012, we had $821.6 million in debt outstanding, of which $14.5 million was current. Our debt obligations consist of the following:$375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notesOn June 30, 2009, we issued $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014 (the 5.0% Notes) with semi annual fixed interest payments due on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010. We swapped the fixed interest portion of these notes for a variable interest rate based on the three month LIBOR plus 2.05%. The variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate were payable quarterly. The LIBOR based rate was set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we terminated the interest rate swap agreement. We received $19.8 million in cash proceeds from the swap termination, which included $1.3 million in accrued interest. The proceeds, net of interest received, are disclosed in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As a result of the termination, the carrying value of the 5.0% Notes was adjusted for the change in fair value of the interest component of the debt up to the date of the termination of the swap in an amount equal to the fair value of the swap, and will be amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. This amortization is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities.$145.0 million term loan facilityOn December 22, 2010, Analog Devices Holdings B.V., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., London Branch as administrative agent. The credit agreement provides for a $145.0 million term loan facility, which matures on December 22, 2013. We have guaranteed the borrowers obligations. The terms of the agreement provide for a three year principal amortization schedule with $3.6 million payable quarterly every March, June, September and December with the balance payable upon the maturity date.$375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notesOn April 4, 2011, we issued $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 (the 3.0% Notes) with semi annual fixed interest payments due on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2011.The indenture governing the 5.0% Notes and 3.0% Notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of November 3, 2012, we were compliant with these covenants. The terms of the $145.0 million term loan facility include limitations on subsidiary indebtedness and on liens against our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, and also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of November 3, 2012, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 16, Debt, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information on our outstanding debt.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a five year $165.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2013. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of this facility also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of November 3, 2012, we were compliant with these covenants. Stock Repurchase ProgramOur common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $5.0 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of November 3, 2012, we had repurchased a total of approximately 129.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4,439.0 million under this program. As of November 3, 2012, an additional $561.0 million worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options, or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted to our employees under our equity compensation plans. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors, including our financial 35performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the United States. Capital ExpendituresNet additions to property, plant and equipment were $132.2 million in fiscal 2012 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $90 million to $120 million in fiscal 2013 to be used primarily in our manufacturing facilities and to be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. DividendsOn November 26, 2012, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 18, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2012 and is expected to total approximately $90.4 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.30 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity. Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of November 3, 2012: Payment due by period Less than More than(thousands) Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 YearsContractual obligations: Operating leases (a) $89,028 $29,559 $36,299 $10,733 $12,437Debt obligations 810,108 14,500 420,608 375,000 Interest payments associated with long term debt obligations (b) 77,763 30,775 41,363 5,625 Deferred compensation plan (c) 28,480 54 28,426Pension funding (d) 2,488 2,488 Total $1,007,867 $77,376 $498,270 $391,358 $40,863 (a)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.(b)The interest payments related to our term loan facility are based on LIBOR plus a spread of 1.25% (1.46% as of November 3, 2012). The actual payments will be based on the LIBOR rate corresponding to the tenor of the interest period chosen, plus a spread of 1.25% which is set two business days prior to the start of the new interest period.(c)These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the More than 5 Years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the More than 5 Years column of the table.(d)Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2013. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements.36Our 2011 acquisition of Lyric Semiconductor involves the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information regarding our acquisitions.As of November 3, 2012, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $10.1 million, which are included in Other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of November 3, 2012.Off balance Sheet FinancingAs of November 3, 2012, we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements.OutlookThe following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us.We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be down approximately 6% to 12% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Our plan is for gross margin percentage for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be approximately 62.0%. We are planning for operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be approximately $223 million and our tax rate to be approximately 18%. As a result, our plan is for Diluted EPS to be approximately $0.40 to $0.48 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.New Accounting PronouncementsFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2t, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.37Inventory ValuationWe value inventories at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.Long Lived AssetsWe review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. For our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred on August 5, 2012, we identified our reporting units to be our five operating segments, which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment. The performance of the test involves a two step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.38Value of Contingent Consideration related to Business CombinationWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.Accounting for Income TaxesWe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.Stock Based CompensationStock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income. Determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant date fair values using the Black Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following items:39Expected volatility We are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors, including third party estimates, when estimating volatility. We currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the markets current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near the money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year.Expected term We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black Scholes grant date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the longer the expected term used in the Black Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant date fair value of the option.Risk free interest rate The yield on zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate.Expected dividend yield Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarters cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.The amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.4% to all unvested stock based awards as of November 3, 2012. The rate of 4.4% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period. This analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.ContingenciesFrom time to time, we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.40Post Retirement Benefits We have significant pension costs and liabilities related to our foreign defined benefit pension plans that are developed from actuarial valuations specific to each country. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, merit and promotion increases. We are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making our assumptions. Changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in our assumptions. Our assumptions as to the expected long term rates of return on plan assets are based upon the composition of plan assets, historical long term rates of return on similar assets and current and expected market conditions. The discount rate used for non U.S. plans reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income investments on our annual measurement date (November 3) and is subject to change each year. The discount rates used for plans outside the U.S. are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities, the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment. Changes in pension income/costs or assets/liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions and changes in asset values. If the actual results and events of our pension plan differ from our current assumptions, our benefit obligations may be over or under valued. See the disclosures about pension obligations, the composition of plan assets, assumptions and other matters in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and long term rate of return on assets, which are key assumptions in determining our net periodic post retirement benefit cost. The table below illustrates the impact of an increase/(decrease) of 25 basis points in these assumptions for the year ended November 3, 2012. Increase/(Decrease) in Pension Expense 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point DecreaseLong term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost$(0.5) $0.5Discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost$(1) $1ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate ExposureOur interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value of our investments, debt and interest rate swap agreement.Based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of November 3, 2012 and October 29, 2011, our annual interest income would change by approximately $41 million and $38 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of November 3, 2012 and October 29, 2011, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $10 million decline in each year in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of November 3, 2012, we had $750 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which consisted of $375 million 5% senior unsecured notes, due July 1, 2014 and $375 million 3% senior unsecured notes, due April 15, 2016. As of November 3, 2012, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our $375 million of 3% senior unsecured notes outstanding by approximately $13 million. As of November 3, 2012 a similar increase in market interest rates would change the fair value of our $375 million 5% senior unsecured notes by $6 million. 41Foreign Currency ExposureAs more fully described in Note 2i in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we regularly hedge our non U.S. dollar based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November 3, 2012 and October 29, 2011, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately $1 million in losses in earnings or cash flows.The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of November 3, 2012, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of November 3, 2012 and October 29, 2011: November 3, 2012 October 29, 2011Fair value of forward exchange contracts asset$1,061 $2,472Fair value of forward exchange contracts liability$ $Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset$16,800 $17,859Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability$(13,885) $(13,332)The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.42
