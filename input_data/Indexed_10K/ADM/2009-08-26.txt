Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Company Overview The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. The Companys operations are classified into three reportable business segments: Oilseeds Processing, Corn Processing and Agricultural Services. Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered. The Companys remaining operations are aggregated and classified as Other. The Oilseeds Processing segment includes activities related to the origination and crushing of oilseeds such as soybeans, cottonseed, sunflower seeds, canola, rapeseed, peanuts, and flaxseed into vegetable oils and protein meals principally for the food and feed industries. In addition, oilseeds and oilseed products may be processed internally or resold into the marketplace as raw materials for other processing. Crude vegetable oil is sold "as is" or is further processed by refining, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils. Salad oils can be further processed by hydrogenating and or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oil is sold for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products. Refined oil can be further processed for use in the production of biodiesel. Oilseed protein meals are primary ingredients used in the manufacture of commercial livestock and poultry feeds. Oilseeds Processing includes activities related to the production of natural health and nutrition products and the production of other specialty food and feed ingredients. This segment also includes activities related to the Companys unconsolidated affiliate in Asia, Wilmar International Limited. The Corn Processing segment includes activities related to the production of sweeteners, starches, dextrose, and syrups primarily for the food and beverage industry as well as activities related to the production, by fermentation, of bioproducts such as ethanol, amino acids, and other food, feed and industrial products. The Agricultural Services segment utilizes the Companys extensive grain elevator and transportation network to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients for the agricultural processing industry. In addition, the Agricultural Services segment includes activities related to edible bean procurement, rice milling, formula feed, and animal health and nutrition. Agricultural Services grain sourcing and transportation network also provides reliable and efficient services to the Companys agricultural processing operations. Also included in Agricultural Services are the activities of A.C. Toepfer International, a global merchant of agricultural commodities and processed products. Other includes the Companys remaining processing operations, consisting of activities related to processing agricultural commodities into food ingredient products such as wheat into wheat flour, cocoa into chocolate and cocoa products, barley into malt, and sugarcane into sugar and ethanol. Other also includes financial activities related to banking, captive insurance, private equity fund investments, and futures commission merchant activities. Operating Performance Indicators The Companys Oilseeds Processing, Agricultural Services, and wheat processing operations are principally agricultural commodity based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity based agricultural raw materials. Therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both net sales and other operating income and cost of products sold and minimal impact on the gross profit of underlying transactions. As a result, changes in gross profit of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in net sales and other operating income amounts. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The Companys Corn Processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. In these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes can result in significant fluctuations in cost of products sold, and such price changes cannot necessarily be passed directly through to the selling price of the finished products. The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, and Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar will result in corresponding fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the Company. The impact of these currency exchange rate changes, where significant, is discussed below. The Company measures the performance of its business segments using key operating statistics such as segment operating profit, return on fixed capital investment, return on net assets, and return on equity. The Companys operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company does not provide forward looking information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 2009 Compared to 2008 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Net corn costs increased significantly in 2009 compared to 2008, negatively impacting ethanol margins, and, to a lesser extent, sweeteners and starches margins as the higher net corn costs were only partially offset by increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Additionally, lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices and excess ethanol industry capacity negatively impacted ethanol margins. Demand for agricultural commodities, freight, and other products was weaker during 2009 in line with the downturn in the global economy. Results were negatively impacted by decreased equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates including significant non cash charges related to currency derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V., and losses from the Companys managed fund investments. Earnings before income taxes for 2009 include a credit of $517 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a charge of $569 million in 2008. Income taxes for 2009 include charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income decreased 1% to $69.2 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts and decreased sales volumes partially offset by higher average selling prices. Net sales and other operating income increased $3.0 billion due to higher average selling prices primarily related to higher underlying commodity costs, decreased $2.0 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts, and decreased $1.6 billion due to lower sales volumes and other. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 15,579 $ 14,477 $ 1,102 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,760 8,588 172 Asia 179 214 (35 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 24,518 23,279 1,239 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,785 3,546 239 Bioproducts 3,938 3,591 347 Total Corn Processing 7,723 7,137 586 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 31,342 33,749 (2,407 ) Transportation 242 219 23 Total Agricultural Services 31,584 33,968 (2,384 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 5,272 5,335 (63 ) Financial 110 97 13 Total Other 5,382 5,432 (50 ) Total $ 69,207 $ 69,816 $ (609 ) Oilseeds Processing sales increased 5% to $24.5 billion due principally to increased sales volumes of merchandised oilseeds and biodiesel partially offset by lower sales volumes of vegetable oil and protein meal. Corn Processing sales increased 8% to $7.7 billion due principally to higher sales volumes of ethanol and higher average selling prices of sweeteners and starches, partially offset by lower average selling prices of ethanol. Agricultural Services sales decreased 7% to $31.6 billion due principally to lower sales volumes of grain. Other sales decreased 1% to $5.4 billion primarily due to the sale of the Companys malting business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and lower average selling prices of wheat flour. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher average selling prices of cocoa products and increased chocolate sales volumes. Cost of products sold decreased 1% to $65.1 billion, in line with the decrease in net sales and other operating income. Cost of products sold decreased $856 million due principally to decreased sales volumes, decreased LIFO inventory valuations and approximately $1.9 billion from the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased agricultural commodity costs. Manufacturing expenses decreased $215 million primarily due to decreased energy and fuel costs. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion were comparable to 2008. Decreased employee related costs and favorable impacts from foreign currency translation were offset by increases in provisions for doubtful accounts. Other (income) expense net decreased $344 million primarily due to decreased results from equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $270 million, and decreased investment income. Equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates included $275 million of foreign exchange derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 767 $ 727 $ 40 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 265 181 84 Asia 248 132 116 Total Oilseeds Processing 1,280 1,040 240 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 500 557 (57 ) Bioproducts (315 ) 404 (719 ) Total Corn Processing 185 961 (776 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 832 873 (41 ) Transportation 162 144 18 Total Agricultural Services 994 1,017 (23 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 51 217 (166 ) Financial (57 ) 206 (263 ) Total Other (6 ) 423 (429 ) Total Segment Operating Profit 2,453 3,441 (988 ) Corporate 81 (817 ) 898 Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,534 $ 2,624 $ (90 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 23% to $1.3 billion. Crushing and origination results increased $40 million. Improved global crushing margins were partially offset by lower fertilizer sales volumes and margins and lower North American crushing volumes due to decreased demand for vegetable oil and protein meal. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $84 million due principally to higher biodiesel sales volumes in South America and increased average margins for value added products. 2008 results for refining, packaging, biodiesel and other included asset abandonment charges of $27 million. Asia results increased $116 million due principally to the Companys share in improved operating results of Wilmar International Limited. Corn Processing operating profits decreased 81% to $185 million. Sweeteners and starches decreased $57 million due to the impact of higher net corn costs partially offset by higher average sweetener and starches selling prices. Bioproducts operating profit decreased $719 million for the year as ethanol and lysine margins declined significantly due to higher corn costs and lower average selling prices. Ethanol margins were also impacted by lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices, and excess ethanol industry capacity. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Agricultural Services operating profits decreased 2% to $994 million. Merchandising and handling profit decreased $41 million. Merchandising margins moderated as demand for commodities slowed following the downturn in the global economy. Transportation results increased $18 million due to higher barge freight rates. Other operating profits decreased 101% to a loss of $6 million. Wheat, cocoa, malt, and sugar processing operating profit decreased $166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa and wheat processing margins. Financial operating profit decreased $263 million due to losses on managed fund investments compared to gains for the year ended June 30, 2008, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income and lower marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage service business. Corporate results increased $898 million to $81 million, primarily due to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations which resulted in credits of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $569 million of LIFO charges for the year ended June 30, 2008. Unallocated interest expense increased $238 million primarily due to higher long term debt interest expense and decreased interest income. Corporate interest income decreased due to lower short term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments. The Companys effective tax rate during 2009 was 32.6% compared to 31.3% during 2008. Income taxes increased $5 million. Lower pre tax earnings and positive impacts from favorable changes in geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and return to provision adjustments, were offset by charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. 2008 Compared to 2007 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Strong demand for agricultural commodities and processed products challenged the global supply chain and provided exceptional margin opportunities in 2008. Strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and strong fertilizer demand in South America positively impacted Oilseeds Processing results. The market price of corn rose due to increased demand, resulting in higher raw material costs for Corn Processing which were only partially passed on in the form of increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Average ethanol selling prices decreased due to additional supply entering the market. Large North American crops combined with global wheat shortages created favorable conditions in agricultural merchandising and handling operations. Increased commodity costs resulted in larger LIFO inventory valuation reserves. Earnings before income taxes decreased due principally to gains totaling $1.0 billion before income tax on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the exchange of the Companys interest in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International Limited (the Wilmar gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 include a charge of $569 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a charge of $207 million in 2007. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 also include a $32 million charge related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, a $38 million gain on sales of securities, and a $21 million gain on the disposal of long lived assets. Earnings before income taxes for 2007 include charges of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures and $21 million related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 727 $ 414 $ 313 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 181 202 (21 ) Asia 132 523 (391 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 1,040 1,139 (99 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 557 510 47 Bioproducts 404 595 (191 ) Total Corn Processing 961 1,105 (144 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 873 382 491 Transportation 144 156 (12 ) Total Agricultural Services 1,017 538 479 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 217 209 8 Financial 206 170 36 Total Other 423 379 44 Total Segment Operating Profit 3,441 3,161 280 Corporate (817 ) (7 ) (810 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,624 $ 3,154 $ (530 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The Companys Corn Processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. In these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes can result in significant fluctuations in cost of products sold, and such price changes cannot necessarily be passed directly through to the selling price of the finished products. The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, and Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar will result in corresponding fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the Company. The impact of these currency exchange rate changes, where significant, is discussed below. The Company measures the performance of its business segments using key operating statistics such as segment operating profit, return on fixed capital investment, return on net assets, and return on equity. The Companys operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company does not provide forward looking information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 2009 Compared to 2008 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Net corn costs increased significantly in 2009 compared to 2008, negatively impacting ethanol margins, and, to a lesser extent, sweeteners and starches margins as the higher net corn costs were only partially offset by increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Additionally, lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices and excess ethanol industry capacity negatively impacted ethanol margins. Demand for agricultural commodities, freight, and other products was weaker during 2009 in line with the downturn in the global economy. Results were negatively impacted by decreased equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates including significant non cash charges related to currency derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V., and losses from the Companys managed fund investments. Earnings before income taxes for 2009 include a credit of $517 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a charge of $569 million in 2008. Income taxes for 2009 include charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income decreased 1% to $69.2 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts and decreased sales volumes partially offset by higher average selling prices. Net sales and other operating income increased $3.0 billion due to higher average selling prices primarily related to higher underlying commodity costs, decreased $2.0 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts, and decreased $1.6 billion due to lower sales volumes and other. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 15,579 $ 14,477 $ 1,102 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,760 8,588 172 Asia 179 214 (35 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 24,518 23,279 1,239 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,785 3,546 239 Bioproducts 3,938 3,591 347 Total Corn Processing 7,723 7,137 586 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 31,342 33,749 (2,407 ) Transportation 242 219 23 Total Agricultural Services 31,584 33,968 (2,384 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 5,272 5,335 (63 ) Financial 110 97 13 Total Other 5,382 5,432 (50 ) Total $ 69,207 $ 69,816 $ (609 ) Oilseeds Processing sales increased 5% to $24.5 billion due principally to increased sales volumes of merchandised oilseeds and biodiesel partially offset by lower sales volumes of vegetable oil and protein meal. Corn Processing sales increased 8% to $7.7 billion due principally to higher sales volumes of ethanol and higher average selling prices of sweeteners and starches, partially offset by lower average selling prices of ethanol. Agricultural Services sales decreased 7% to $31.6 billion due principally to lower sales volumes of grain. Other sales decreased 1% to $5.4 billion primarily due to the sale of the Companys malting business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and lower average selling prices of wheat flour. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher average selling prices of cocoa products and increased chocolate sales volumes. Cost of products sold decreased 1% to $65.1 billion, in line with the decrease in net sales and other operating income. Cost of products sold decreased $856 million due principally to decreased sales volumes, decreased LIFO inventory valuations and approximately $1.9 billion from the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased agricultural commodity costs. Manufacturing expenses decreased $215 million primarily due to decreased energy and fuel costs. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion were comparable to 2008. Decreased employee related costs and favorable impacts from foreign currency translation were offset by increases in provisions for doubtful accounts. Other (income) expense net decreased $344 million primarily due to decreased results from equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $270 million, and decreased investment income. Equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates included $275 million of foreign exchange derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 767 $ 727 $ 40 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 265 181 84 Asia 248 132 116 Total Oilseeds Processing 1,280 1,040 240 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 500 557 (57 ) Bioproducts (315 ) 404 (719 ) Total Corn Processing 185 961 (776 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 832 873 (41 ) Transportation 162 144 18 Total Agricultural Services 994 1,017 (23 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 51 217 (166 ) Financial (57 ) 206 (263 ) Total Other (6 ) 423 (429 ) Total Segment Operating Profit 2,453 3,441 (988 ) Corporate 81 (817 ) 898 Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,534 $ 2,624 $ (90 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 23% to $1.3 billion. Crushing and origination results increased $40 million. Improved global crushing margins were partially offset by lower fertilizer sales volumes and margins and lower North American crushing volumes due to decreased demand for vegetable oil and protein meal. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $84 million due principally to higher biodiesel sales volumes in South America and increased average margins for value added products. 2008 results for refining, packaging, biodiesel and other included asset abandonment charges of $27 million. Asia results increased $116 million due principally to the Companys share in improved operating results of Wilmar International Limited. Corn Processing operating profits decreased 81% to $185 million. Sweeteners and starches decreased $57 million due to the impact of higher net corn costs partially offset by higher average sweetener and starches selling prices. Bioproducts operating profit decreased $719 million for the year as ethanol and lysine margins declined significantly due to higher corn costs and lower average selling prices. Ethanol margins were also impacted by lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices, and excess ethanol industry capacity. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Agricultural Services operating profits decreased 2% to $994 million. Merchandising and handling profit decreased $41 million. Merchandising margins moderated as demand for commodities slowed following the downturn in the global economy. Transportation results increased $18 million due to higher barge freight rates. Other operating profits decreased 101% to a loss of $6 million. Wheat, cocoa, malt, and sugar processing operating profit decreased $166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa and wheat processing margins. Financial operating profit decreased $263 million due to losses on managed fund investments compared to gains for the year ended June 30, 2008, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income and lower marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage service business. Corporate results increased $898 million to $81 million, primarily due to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations which resulted in credits of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $569 million of LIFO charges for the year ended June 30, 2008. Unallocated interest expense increased $238 million primarily due to higher long term debt interest expense and decreased interest income. Corporate interest income decreased due to lower short term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments. The Companys effective tax rate during 2009 was 32.6% compared to 31.3% during 2008. Income taxes increased $5 million. Lower pre tax earnings and positive impacts from favorable changes in geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and return to provision adjustments, were offset by charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. 2008 Compared to 2007 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Strong demand for agricultural commodities and processed products challenged the global supply chain and provided exceptional margin opportunities in 2008. Strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and strong fertilizer demand in South America positively impacted Oilseeds Processing results. The market price of corn rose due to increased demand, resulting in higher raw material costs for Corn Processing which were only partially passed on in the form of increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Average ethanol selling prices decreased due to additional supply entering the market. Large North American crops combined with global wheat shortages created favorable conditions in agricultural merchandising and handling operations. Increased commodity costs resulted in larger LIFO inventory valuation reserves. Earnings before income taxes decreased due principally to gains totaling $1.0 billion before income tax on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the exchange of the Companys interest in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International Limited (the Wilmar gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 include a charge of $569 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a charge of $207 million in 2007. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 also include a $32 million charge related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, a $38 million gain on sales of securities, and a $21 million gain on the disposal of long lived assets. Earnings before income taxes for 2007 include charges of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures and $21 million related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 727 $ 414 $ 313 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 181 202 (21 ) Asia 132 523 (391 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 1,040 1,139 (99 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 557 510 47 Bioproducts 404 595 (191 ) Total Corn Processing 961 1,105 (144 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 873 382 491 Transportation 144 156 (12 ) Total Agricultural Services 1,017 538 479 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 217 209 8 Financial 206 170 36 Total Other 423 379 44 Total Segment Operating Profit 3,441 3,161 280 Corporate (817 ) (7 ) (810 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,624 $ 3,154 $ (530 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income decreased 1% to $69.2 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts and decreased sales volumes partially offset by higher average selling prices. Net sales and other operating income increased $3.0 billion due to higher average selling prices primarily related to higher underlying commodity costs, decreased $2.0 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts, and decreased $1.6 billion due to lower sales volumes and other. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 15,579 $ 14,477 $ 1,102 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,760 8,588 172 Asia 179 214 (35 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 24,518 23,279 1,239 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,785 3,546 239 Bioproducts 3,938 3,591 347 Total Corn Processing 7,723 7,137 586 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 31,342 33,749 (2,407 ) Transportation 242 219 23 Total Agricultural Services 31,584 33,968 (2,384 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 5,272 5,335 (63 ) Financial 110 97 13 Total Other 5,382 5,432 (50 ) Total $ 69,207 $ 69,816 $ (609 ) Oilseeds Processing sales increased 5% to $24.5 billion due principally to increased sales volumes of merchandised oilseeds and biodiesel partially offset by lower sales volumes of vegetable oil and protein meal. Corn Processing sales increased 8% to $7.7 billion due principally to higher sales volumes of ethanol and higher average selling prices of sweeteners and starches, partially offset by lower average selling prices of ethanol. Agricultural Services sales decreased 7% to $31.6 billion due principally to lower sales volumes of grain. Other sales decreased 1% to $5.4 billion primarily due to the sale of the Companys malting business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and lower average selling prices of wheat flour. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher average selling prices of cocoa products and increased chocolate sales volumes. Cost of products sold decreased 1% to $65.1 billion, in line with the decrease in net sales and other operating income. Cost of products sold decreased $856 million due principally to decreased sales volumes, decreased LIFO inventory valuations and approximately $1.9 billion from the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased agricultural commodity costs. Manufacturing expenses decreased $215 million primarily due to decreased energy and fuel costs. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion were comparable to 2008. Decreased employee related costs and favorable impacts from foreign currency translation were offset by increases in provisions for doubtful accounts. Other (income) expense net decreased $344 million primarily due to decreased results from equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $270 million, and decreased investment income. Equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates included $275 million of foreign exchange derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 767 $ 727 $ 40 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 265 181 84 Asia 248 132 116 Total Oilseeds Processing 1,280 1,040 240 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 500 557 (57 ) Bioproducts (315 ) 404 (719 ) Total Corn Processing 185 961 (776 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 832 873 (41 ) Transportation 162 144 18 Total Agricultural Services 994 1,017 (23 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 51 217 (166 ) Financial (57 ) 206 (263 ) Total Other (6 ) 423 (429 ) Total Segment Operating Profit 2,453 3,441 (988 ) Corporate 81 (817 ) 898 Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,534 $ 2,624 $ (90 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 23% to $1.3 billion. Crushing and origination results increased $40 million. Improved global crushing margins were partially offset by lower fertilizer sales volumes and margins and lower North American crushing volumes due to decreased demand for vegetable oil and protein meal. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $84 million due principally to higher biodiesel sales volumes in South America and increased average margins for value added products. 2008 results for refining, packaging, biodiesel and other included asset abandonment charges of $27 million. Asia results increased $116 million due principally to the Companys share in improved operating results of Wilmar International Limited. Corn Processing operating profits decreased 81% to $185 million. Sweeteners and starches decreased $57 million due to the impact of higher net corn costs partially offset by higher average sweetener and starches selling prices. Bioproducts operating profit decreased $719 million for the year as ethanol and lysine margins declined significantly due to higher corn costs and lower average selling prices. Ethanol margins were also impacted by lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices, and excess ethanol industry capacity. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Agricultural Services operating profits decreased 2% to $994 million. Merchandising and handling profit decreased $41 million. Merchandising margins moderated as demand for commodities slowed following the downturn in the global economy. Transportation results increased $18 million due to higher barge freight rates. Other operating profits decreased 101% to a loss of $6 million. Wheat, cocoa, malt, and sugar processing operating profit decreased $166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa and wheat processing margins. Financial operating profit decreased $263 million due to losses on managed fund investments compared to gains for the year ended June 30, 2008, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income and lower marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage service business. Corporate results increased $898 million to $81 million, primarily due to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations which resulted in credits of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $569 million of LIFO charges for the year ended June 30, 2008. Unallocated interest expense increased $238 million primarily due to higher long term debt interest expense and decreased interest income. Corporate interest income decreased due to lower short term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments. The Companys effective tax rate during 2009 was 32.6% compared to 31.3% during 2008. Income taxes increased $5 million. Lower pre tax earnings and positive impacts from favorable changes in geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and return to provision adjustments, were offset by charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. 2008 Compared to 2007 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Strong demand for agricultural commodities and processed products challenged the global supply chain and provided exceptional margin opportunities in 2008. Strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and strong fertilizer demand in South America positively impacted Oilseeds Processing results. The market price of corn rose due to increased demand, resulting in higher raw material costs for Corn Processing which were only partially passed on in the form of increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Average ethanol selling prices decreased due to additional supply entering the market. Large North American crops combined with global wheat shortages created favorable conditions in agricultural merchandising and handling operations. Increased commodity costs resulted in larger LIFO inventory valuation reserves. Earnings before income taxes decreased due principally to gains totaling $1.0 billion before income tax on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the exchange of the Companys interest in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International Limited (the Wilmar gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 include a charge of $569 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a charge of $207 million in 2007. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 also include a $32 million charge related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, a $38 million gain on sales of securities, and a $21 million gain on the disposal of long lived assets. Earnings before income taxes for 2007 include charges of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures and $21 million related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 727 $ 414 $ 313 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 181 202 (21 ) Asia 132 523 (391 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 1,040 1,139 (99 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 557 510 47 Bioproducts 404 595 (191 ) Total Corn Processing 961 1,105 (144 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 873 382 491 Transportation 144 156 (12 ) Total Agricultural Services 1,017 538 479 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 217 209 8 Financial 206 170 36 Total Other 423 379 44 Total Segment Operating Profit 3,441 3,161 280 Corporate (817 ) (7 ) (810 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,624 $ 3,154 $ (530 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion were comparable to 2008. Decreased employee related costs and favorable impacts from foreign currency translation were offset by increases in provisions for doubtful accounts. Other (income) expense net decreased $344 million primarily due to decreased results from equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $270 million, and decreased investment income. Equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates included $275 million of foreign exchange derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 767 $ 727 $ 40 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 265 181 84 Asia 248 132 116 Total Oilseeds Processing 1,280 1,040 240 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 500 557 (57 ) Bioproducts (315 ) 404 (719 ) Total Corn Processing 185 961 (776 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 832 873 (41 ) Transportation 162 144 18 Total Agricultural Services 994 1,017 (23 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 51 217 (166 ) Financial (57 ) 206 (263 ) Total Other (6 ) 423 (429 ) Total Segment Operating Profit 2,453 3,441 (988 ) Corporate 81 (817 ) 898 Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,534 $ 2,624 $ (90 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 23% to $1.3 billion. Crushing and origination results increased $40 million. Improved global crushing margins were partially offset by lower fertilizer sales volumes and margins and lower North American crushing volumes due to decreased demand for vegetable oil and protein meal. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $84 million due principally to higher biodiesel sales volumes in South America and increased average margins for value added products. 2008 results for refining, packaging, biodiesel and other included asset abandonment charges of $27 million. Asia results increased $116 million due principally to the Companys share in improved operating results of Wilmar International Limited. Corn Processing operating profits decreased 81% to $185 million. Sweeteners and starches decreased $57 million due to the impact of higher net corn costs partially offset by higher average sweetener and starches selling prices. Bioproducts operating profit decreased $719 million for the year as ethanol and lysine margins declined significantly due to higher corn costs and lower average selling prices. Ethanol margins were also impacted by lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices, and excess ethanol industry capacity. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Agricultural Services operating profits decreased 2% to $994 million. Merchandising and handling profit decreased $41 million. Merchandising margins moderated as demand for commodities slowed following the downturn in the global economy. Transportation results increased $18 million due to higher barge freight rates. Other operating profits decreased 101% to a loss of $6 million. Wheat, cocoa, malt, and sugar processing operating profit decreased $166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa and wheat processing margins. Financial operating profit decreased $263 million due to losses on managed fund investments compared to gains for the year ended June 30, 2008, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income and lower marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage service business. Corporate results increased $898 million to $81 million, primarily due to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations which resulted in credits of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $569 million of LIFO charges for the year ended June 30, 2008. Unallocated interest expense increased $238 million primarily due to higher long term debt interest expense and decreased interest income. Corporate interest income decreased due to lower short term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments. The Companys effective tax rate during 2009 was 32.6% compared to 31.3% during 2008. Income taxes increased $5 million. Lower pre tax earnings and positive impacts from favorable changes in geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and return to provision adjustments, were offset by charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. 2008 Compared to 2007 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Strong demand for agricultural commodities and processed products challenged the global supply chain and provided exceptional margin opportunities in 2008. Strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and strong fertilizer demand in South America positively impacted Oilseeds Processing results. The market price of corn rose due to increased demand, resulting in higher raw material costs for Corn Processing which were only partially passed on in the form of increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Average ethanol selling prices decreased due to additional supply entering the market. Large North American crops combined with global wheat shortages created favorable conditions in agricultural merchandising and handling operations. Increased commodity costs resulted in larger LIFO inventory valuation reserves. Earnings before income taxes decreased due principally to gains totaling $1.0 billion before income tax on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the exchange of the Companys interest in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International Limited (the Wilmar gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 include a charge of $569 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a charge of $207 million in 2007. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 also include a $32 million charge related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, a $38 million gain on sales of securities, and a $21 million gain on the disposal of long lived assets. Earnings before income taxes for 2007 include charges of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures and $21 million related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 727 $ 414 $ 313 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 181 202 (21 ) Asia 132 523 (391 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 1,040 1,139 (99 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 557 510 47 Bioproducts 404 595 (191 ) Total Corn Processing 961 1,105 (144 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 873 382 491 Transportation 144 156 (12 ) Total Agricultural Services 1,017 538 479 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 217 209 8 Financial 206 170 36 Total Other 423 379 44 Total Segment Operating Profit 3,441 3,161 280 Corporate (817 ) (7 ) (810 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,624 $ 3,154 $ (530 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Agricultural Services operating profits decreased 2% to $994 million. Merchandising and handling profit decreased $41 million. Merchandising margins moderated as demand for commodities slowed following the downturn in the global economy. Transportation results increased $18 million due to higher barge freight rates. Other operating profits decreased 101% to a loss of $6 million. Wheat, cocoa, malt, and sugar processing operating profit decreased $166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa and wheat processing margins. Financial operating profit decreased $263 million due to losses on managed fund investments compared to gains for the year ended June 30, 2008, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income and lower marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage service business. Corporate results increased $898 million to $81 million, primarily due to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations which resulted in credits of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $569 million of LIFO charges for the year ended June 30, 2008. Unallocated interest expense increased $238 million primarily due to higher long term debt interest expense and decreased interest income. Corporate interest income decreased due to lower short term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments. The Companys effective tax rate during 2009 was 32.6% compared to 31.3% during 2008. Income taxes increased $5 million. Lower pre tax earnings and positive impacts from favorable changes in geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and return to provision adjustments, were offset by charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. 2008 Compared to 2007 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Strong demand for agricultural commodities and processed products challenged the global supply chain and provided exceptional margin opportunities in 2008. Strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and strong fertilizer demand in South America positively impacted Oilseeds Processing results. The market price of corn rose due to increased demand, resulting in higher raw material costs for Corn Processing which were only partially passed on in the form of increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Average ethanol selling prices decreased due to additional supply entering the market. Large North American crops combined with global wheat shortages created favorable conditions in agricultural merchandising and handling operations. Increased commodity costs resulted in larger LIFO inventory valuation reserves. Earnings before income taxes decreased due principally to gains totaling $1.0 billion before income tax on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the exchange of the Companys interest in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International Limited (the Wilmar gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 include a charge of $569 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a charge of $207 million in 2007. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 also include a $32 million charge related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, a $38 million gain on sales of securities, and a $21 million gain on the disposal of long lived assets. Earnings before income taxes for 2007 include charges of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures and $21 million related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 727 $ 414 $ 313 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 181 202 (21 ) Asia 132 523 (391 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 1,040 1,139 (99 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 557 510 47 Bioproducts 404 595 (191 ) Total Corn Processing 961 1,105 (144 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 873 382 491 Transportation 144 156 (12 ) Total Agricultural Services 1,017 538 479 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 217 209 8 Financial 206 170 36 Total Other 423 379 44 Total Segment Operating Profit 3,441 3,161 280 Corporate (817 ) (7 ) (810 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,624 $ 3,154 $ (530 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007.

Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007.

Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused.

The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive.

These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements.

If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Company Overview The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. The Companys operations are classified into three reportable business segments: Oilseeds Processing, Corn Processing and Agricultural Services. Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered. The Companys remaining operations are aggregated and classified as Other. The Oilseeds Processing segment includes activities related to the origination and crushing of oilseeds such as soybeans, cottonseed, sunflower seeds, canola, rapeseed, peanuts, and flaxseed into vegetable oils and protein meals principally for the food and feed industries. In addition, oilseeds and oilseed products may be processed internally or resold into the marketplace as raw materials for other processing. Crude vegetable oil is sold "as is" or is further processed by refining, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils. Salad oils can be further processed by hydrogenating and or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oil is sold for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products. Refined oil can be further processed for use in the production of biodiesel. Oilseed protein meals are primary ingredients used in the manufacture of commercial livestock and poultry feeds. Oilseeds Processing includes activities related to the production of natural health and nutrition products and the production of other specialty food and feed ingredients. This segment also includes activities related to the Companys unconsolidated affiliate in Asia, Wilmar International Limited. The Corn Processing segment includes activities related to the production of sweeteners, starches, dextrose, and syrups primarily for the food and beverage industry as well as activities related to the production, by fermentation, of bioproducts such as ethanol, amino acids, and other food, feed and industrial products. The Agricultural Services segment utilizes the Companys extensive grain elevator and transportation network to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients for the agricultural processing industry. In addition, the Agricultural Services segment includes activities related to edible bean procurement, rice milling, formula feed, and animal health and nutrition. Agricultural Services grain sourcing and transportation network also provides reliable and efficient services to the Companys agricultural processing operations. Also included in Agricultural Services are the activities of A.C. Toepfer International, a global merchant of agricultural commodities and processed products. Other includes the Companys remaining processing operations, consisting of activities related to processing agricultural commodities into food ingredient products such as wheat into wheat flour, cocoa into chocolate and cocoa products, barley into malt, and sugarcane into sugar and ethanol. Other also includes financial activities related to banking, captive insurance, private equity fund investments, and futures commission merchant activities. Operating Performance Indicators The Companys Oilseeds Processing, Agricultural Services, and wheat processing operations are principally agricultural commodity based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity based agricultural raw materials. Therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both net sales and other operating income and cost of products sold and minimal impact on the gross profit of underlying transactions. As a result, changes in gross profit of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in net sales and other operating income amounts. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The Companys Corn Processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. In these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes can result in significant fluctuations in cost of products sold, and such price changes cannot necessarily be passed directly through to the selling price of the finished products. The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, and Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar will result in corresponding fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the Company. The impact of these currency exchange rate changes, where significant, is discussed below. The Company measures the performance of its business segments using key operating statistics such as segment operating profit, return on fixed capital investment, return on net assets, and return on equity. The Companys operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company does not provide forward looking information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 2009 Compared to 2008 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Net corn costs increased significantly in 2009 compared to 2008, negatively impacting ethanol margins, and, to a lesser extent, sweeteners and starches margins as the higher net corn costs were only partially offset by increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Additionally, lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices and excess ethanol industry capacity negatively impacted ethanol margins. Demand for agricultural commodities, freight, and other products was weaker during 2009 in line with the downturn in the global economy. Results were negatively impacted by decreased equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates including significant non cash charges related to currency derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V., and losses from the Companys managed fund investments. Earnings before income taxes for 2009 include a credit of $517 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a charge of $569 million in 2008. Income taxes for 2009 include charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income decreased 1% to $69.2 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts and decreased sales volumes partially offset by higher average selling prices. Net sales and other operating income increased $3.0 billion due to higher average selling prices primarily related to higher underlying commodity costs, decreased $2.0 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts, and decreased $1.6 billion due to lower sales volumes and other. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 15,579 $ 14,477 $ 1,102 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,760 8,588 172 Asia 179 214 (35 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 24,518 23,279 1,239 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,785 3,546 239 Bioproducts 3,938 3,591 347 Total Corn Processing 7,723 7,137 586 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 31,342 33,749 (2,407 ) Transportation 242 219 23 Total Agricultural Services 31,584 33,968 (2,384 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 5,272 5,335 (63 ) Financial 110 97 13 Total Other 5,382 5,432 (50 ) Total $ 69,207 $ 69,816 $ (609 ) Oilseeds Processing sales increased 5% to $24.5 billion due principally to increased sales volumes of merchandised oilseeds and biodiesel partially offset by lower sales volumes of vegetable oil and protein meal. Corn Processing sales increased 8% to $7.7 billion due principally to higher sales volumes of ethanol and higher average selling prices of sweeteners and starches, partially offset by lower average selling prices of ethanol. Agricultural Services sales decreased 7% to $31.6 billion due principally to lower sales volumes of grain. Other sales decreased 1% to $5.4 billion primarily due to the sale of the Companys malting business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and lower average selling prices of wheat flour. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher average selling prices of cocoa products and increased chocolate sales volumes. Cost of products sold decreased 1% to $65.1 billion, in line with the decrease in net sales and other operating income. Cost of products sold decreased $856 million due principally to decreased sales volumes, decreased LIFO inventory valuations and approximately $1.9 billion from the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased agricultural commodity costs. Manufacturing expenses decreased $215 million primarily due to decreased energy and fuel costs. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion were comparable to 2008. Decreased employee related costs and favorable impacts from foreign currency translation were offset by increases in provisions for doubtful accounts. Other (income) expense net decreased $344 million primarily due to decreased results from equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $270 million, and decreased investment income. Equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates included $275 million of foreign exchange derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 767 $ 727 $ 40 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 265 181 84 Asia 248 132 116 Total Oilseeds Processing 1,280 1,040 240 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 500 557 (57 ) Bioproducts (315 ) 404 (719 ) Total Corn Processing 185 961 (776 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 832 873 (41 ) Transportation 162 144 18 Total Agricultural Services 994 1,017 (23 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 51 217 (166 ) Financial (57 ) 206 (263 ) Total Other (6 ) 423 (429 ) Total Segment Operating Profit 2,453 3,441 (988 ) Corporate 81 (817 ) 898 Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,534 $ 2,624 $ (90 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 23% to $1.3 billion. Crushing and origination results increased $40 million. Improved global crushing margins were partially offset by lower fertilizer sales volumes and margins and lower North American crushing volumes due to decreased demand for vegetable oil and protein meal. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $84 million due principally to higher biodiesel sales volumes in South America and increased average margins for value added products. 2008 results for refining, packaging, biodiesel and other included asset abandonment charges of $27 million. Asia results increased $116 million due principally to the Companys share in improved operating results of Wilmar International Limited. Corn Processing operating profits decreased 81% to $185 million. Sweeteners and starches decreased $57 million due to the impact of higher net corn costs partially offset by higher average sweetener and starches selling prices. Bioproducts operating profit decreased $719 million for the year as ethanol and lysine margins declined significantly due to higher corn costs and lower average selling prices. Ethanol margins were also impacted by lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices, and excess ethanol industry capacity. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Agricultural Services operating profits decreased 2% to $994 million. Merchandising and handling profit decreased $41 million. Merchandising margins moderated as demand for commodities slowed following the downturn in the global economy. Transportation results increased $18 million due to higher barge freight rates. Other operating profits decreased 101% to a loss of $6 million. Wheat, cocoa, malt, and sugar processing operating profit decreased $166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa and wheat processing margins. Financial operating profit decreased $263 million due to losses on managed fund investments compared to gains for the year ended June 30, 2008, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income and lower marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage service business. Corporate results increased $898 million to $81 million, primarily due to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations which resulted in credits of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $569 million of LIFO charges for the year ended June 30, 2008. Unallocated interest expense increased $238 million primarily due to higher long term debt interest expense and decreased interest income. Corporate interest income decreased due to lower short term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments. The Companys effective tax rate during 2009 was 32.6% compared to 31.3% during 2008. Income taxes increased $5 million. Lower pre tax earnings and positive impacts from favorable changes in geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and return to provision adjustments, were offset by charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. 2008 Compared to 2007 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Strong demand for agricultural commodities and processed products challenged the global supply chain and provided exceptional margin opportunities in 2008. Strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and strong fertilizer demand in South America positively impacted Oilseeds Processing results. The market price of corn rose due to increased demand, resulting in higher raw material costs for Corn Processing which were only partially passed on in the form of increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Average ethanol selling prices decreased due to additional supply entering the market. Large North American crops combined with global wheat shortages created favorable conditions in agricultural merchandising and handling operations. Increased commodity costs resulted in larger LIFO inventory valuation reserves. Earnings before income taxes decreased due principally to gains totaling $1.0 billion before income tax on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the exchange of the Companys interest in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International Limited (the Wilmar gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 include a charge of $569 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a charge of $207 million in 2007. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 also include a $32 million charge related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, a $38 million gain on sales of securities, and a $21 million gain on the disposal of long lived assets. Earnings before income taxes for 2007 include charges of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures and $21 million related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 727 $ 414 $ 313 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 181 202 (21 ) Asia 132 523 (391 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 1,040 1,139 (99 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 557 510 47 Bioproducts 404 595 (191 ) Total Corn Processing 961 1,105 (144 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 873 382 491 Transportation 144 156 (12 ) Total Agricultural Services 1,017 538 479 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 217 209 8 Financial 206 170 36 Total Other 423 379 44 Total Segment Operating Profit 3,441 3,161 280 Corporate (817 ) (7 ) (810 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,624 $ 3,154 $ (530 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The Companys Corn Processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. In these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes can result in significant fluctuations in cost of products sold, and such price changes cannot necessarily be passed directly through to the selling price of the finished products. The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, and Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar will result in corresponding fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the Company. The impact of these currency exchange rate changes, where significant, is discussed below. The Company measures the performance of its business segments using key operating statistics such as segment operating profit, return on fixed capital investment, return on net assets, and return on equity. The Companys operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company does not provide forward looking information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 2009 Compared to 2008 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Net corn costs increased significantly in 2009 compared to 2008, negatively impacting ethanol margins, and, to a lesser extent, sweeteners and starches margins as the higher net corn costs were only partially offset by increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Additionally, lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices and excess ethanol industry capacity negatively impacted ethanol margins. Demand for agricultural commodities, freight, and other products was weaker during 2009 in line with the downturn in the global economy. Results were negatively impacted by decreased equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates including significant non cash charges related to currency derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V., and losses from the Companys managed fund investments. Earnings before income taxes for 2009 include a credit of $517 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a charge of $569 million in 2008. Income taxes for 2009 include charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income decreased 1% to $69.2 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts and decreased sales volumes partially offset by higher average selling prices. Net sales and other operating income increased $3.0 billion due to higher average selling prices primarily related to higher underlying commodity costs, decreased $2.0 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts, and decreased $1.6 billion due to lower sales volumes and other. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 15,579 $ 14,477 $ 1,102 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,760 8,588 172 Asia 179 214 (35 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 24,518 23,279 1,239 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,785 3,546 239 Bioproducts 3,938 3,591 347 Total Corn Processing 7,723 7,137 586 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 31,342 33,749 (2,407 ) Transportation 242 219 23 Total Agricultural Services 31,584 33,968 (2,384 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 5,272 5,335 (63 ) Financial 110 97 13 Total Other 5,382 5,432 (50 ) Total $ 69,207 $ 69,816 $ (609 ) Oilseeds Processing sales increased 5% to $24.5 billion due principally to increased sales volumes of merchandised oilseeds and biodiesel partially offset by lower sales volumes of vegetable oil and protein meal. Corn Processing sales increased 8% to $7.7 billion due principally to higher sales volumes of ethanol and higher average selling prices of sweeteners and starches, partially offset by lower average selling prices of ethanol. Agricultural Services sales decreased 7% to $31.6 billion due principally to lower sales volumes of grain. Other sales decreased 1% to $5.4 billion primarily due to the sale of the Companys malting business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and lower average selling prices of wheat flour. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher average selling prices of cocoa products and increased chocolate sales volumes. Cost of products sold decreased 1% to $65.1 billion, in line with the decrease in net sales and other operating income. Cost of products sold decreased $856 million due principally to decreased sales volumes, decreased LIFO inventory valuations and approximately $1.9 billion from the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased agricultural commodity costs. Manufacturing expenses decreased $215 million primarily due to decreased energy and fuel costs. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion were comparable to 2008. Decreased employee related costs and favorable impacts from foreign currency translation were offset by increases in provisions for doubtful accounts. Other (income) expense net decreased $344 million primarily due to decreased results from equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $270 million, and decreased investment income. Equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates included $275 million of foreign exchange derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 767 $ 727 $ 40 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 265 181 84 Asia 248 132 116 Total Oilseeds Processing 1,280 1,040 240 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 500 557 (57 ) Bioproducts (315 ) 404 (719 ) Total Corn Processing 185 961 (776 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 832 873 (41 ) Transportation 162 144 18 Total Agricultural Services 994 1,017 (23 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 51 217 (166 ) Financial (57 ) 206 (263 ) Total Other (6 ) 423 (429 ) Total Segment Operating Profit 2,453 3,441 (988 ) Corporate 81 (817 ) 898 Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,534 $ 2,624 $ (90 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 23% to $1.3 billion. Crushing and origination results increased $40 million. Improved global crushing margins were partially offset by lower fertilizer sales volumes and margins and lower North American crushing volumes due to decreased demand for vegetable oil and protein meal. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $84 million due principally to higher biodiesel sales volumes in South America and increased average margins for value added products. 2008 results for refining, packaging, biodiesel and other included asset abandonment charges of $27 million. Asia results increased $116 million due principally to the Companys share in improved operating results of Wilmar International Limited. Corn Processing operating profits decreased 81% to $185 million. Sweeteners and starches decreased $57 million due to the impact of higher net corn costs partially offset by higher average sweetener and starches selling prices. Bioproducts operating profit decreased $719 million for the year as ethanol and lysine margins declined significantly due to higher corn costs and lower average selling prices. Ethanol margins were also impacted by lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices, and excess ethanol industry capacity. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Agricultural Services operating profits decreased 2% to $994 million. Merchandising and handling profit decreased $41 million. Merchandising margins moderated as demand for commodities slowed following the downturn in the global economy. Transportation results increased $18 million due to higher barge freight rates. Other operating profits decreased 101% to a loss of $6 million. Wheat, cocoa, malt, and sugar processing operating profit decreased $166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa and wheat processing margins. Financial operating profit decreased $263 million due to losses on managed fund investments compared to gains for the year ended June 30, 2008, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income and lower marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage service business. Corporate results increased $898 million to $81 million, primarily due to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations which resulted in credits of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $569 million of LIFO charges for the year ended June 30, 2008. Unallocated interest expense increased $238 million primarily due to higher long term debt interest expense and decreased interest income. Corporate interest income decreased due to lower short term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments. The Companys effective tax rate during 2009 was 32.6% compared to 31.3% during 2008. Income taxes increased $5 million. Lower pre tax earnings and positive impacts from favorable changes in geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and return to provision adjustments, were offset by charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. 2008 Compared to 2007 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Strong demand for agricultural commodities and processed products challenged the global supply chain and provided exceptional margin opportunities in 2008. Strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and strong fertilizer demand in South America positively impacted Oilseeds Processing results. The market price of corn rose due to increased demand, resulting in higher raw material costs for Corn Processing which were only partially passed on in the form of increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Average ethanol selling prices decreased due to additional supply entering the market. Large North American crops combined with global wheat shortages created favorable conditions in agricultural merchandising and handling operations. Increased commodity costs resulted in larger LIFO inventory valuation reserves. Earnings before income taxes decreased due principally to gains totaling $1.0 billion before income tax on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the exchange of the Companys interest in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International Limited (the Wilmar gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 include a charge of $569 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a charge of $207 million in 2007. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 also include a $32 million charge related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, a $38 million gain on sales of securities, and a $21 million gain on the disposal of long lived assets. Earnings before income taxes for 2007 include charges of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures and $21 million related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 727 $ 414 $ 313 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 181 202 (21 ) Asia 132 523 (391 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 1,040 1,139 (99 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 557 510 47 Bioproducts 404 595 (191 ) Total Corn Processing 961 1,105 (144 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 873 382 491 Transportation 144 156 (12 ) Total Agricultural Services 1,017 538 479 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 217 209 8 Financial 206 170 36 Total Other 423 379 44 Total Segment Operating Profit 3,441 3,161 280 Corporate (817 ) (7 ) (810 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,624 $ 3,154 $ (530 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income decreased 1% to $69.2 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts and decreased sales volumes partially offset by higher average selling prices. Net sales and other operating income increased $3.0 billion due to higher average selling prices primarily related to higher underlying commodity costs, decreased $2.0 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts, and decreased $1.6 billion due to lower sales volumes and other. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 15,579 $ 14,477 $ 1,102 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,760 8,588 172 Asia 179 214 (35 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 24,518 23,279 1,239 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,785 3,546 239 Bioproducts 3,938 3,591 347 Total Corn Processing 7,723 7,137 586 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 31,342 33,749 (2,407 ) Transportation 242 219 23 Total Agricultural Services 31,584 33,968 (2,384 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 5,272 5,335 (63 ) Financial 110 97 13 Total Other 5,382 5,432 (50 ) Total $ 69,207 $ 69,816 $ (609 ) Oilseeds Processing sales increased 5% to $24.5 billion due principally to increased sales volumes of merchandised oilseeds and biodiesel partially offset by lower sales volumes of vegetable oil and protein meal. Corn Processing sales increased 8% to $7.7 billion due principally to higher sales volumes of ethanol and higher average selling prices of sweeteners and starches, partially offset by lower average selling prices of ethanol. Agricultural Services sales decreased 7% to $31.6 billion due principally to lower sales volumes of grain. Other sales decreased 1% to $5.4 billion primarily due to the sale of the Companys malting business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and lower average selling prices of wheat flour. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher average selling prices of cocoa products and increased chocolate sales volumes. Cost of products sold decreased 1% to $65.1 billion, in line with the decrease in net sales and other operating income. Cost of products sold decreased $856 million due principally to decreased sales volumes, decreased LIFO inventory valuations and approximately $1.9 billion from the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased agricultural commodity costs. Manufacturing expenses decreased $215 million primarily due to decreased energy and fuel costs. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion were comparable to 2008. Decreased employee related costs and favorable impacts from foreign currency translation were offset by increases in provisions for doubtful accounts. Other (income) expense net decreased $344 million primarily due to decreased results from equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $270 million, and decreased investment income. Equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates included $275 million of foreign exchange derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 767 $ 727 $ 40 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 265 181 84 Asia 248 132 116 Total Oilseeds Processing 1,280 1,040 240 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 500 557 (57 ) Bioproducts (315 ) 404 (719 ) Total Corn Processing 185 961 (776 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 832 873 (41 ) Transportation 162 144 18 Total Agricultural Services 994 1,017 (23 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 51 217 (166 ) Financial (57 ) 206 (263 ) Total Other (6 ) 423 (429 ) Total Segment Operating Profit 2,453 3,441 (988 ) Corporate 81 (817 ) 898 Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,534 $ 2,624 $ (90 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 23% to $1.3 billion. Crushing and origination results increased $40 million. Improved global crushing margins were partially offset by lower fertilizer sales volumes and margins and lower North American crushing volumes due to decreased demand for vegetable oil and protein meal. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $84 million due principally to higher biodiesel sales volumes in South America and increased average margins for value added products. 2008 results for refining, packaging, biodiesel and other included asset abandonment charges of $27 million. Asia results increased $116 million due principally to the Companys share in improved operating results of Wilmar International Limited. Corn Processing operating profits decreased 81% to $185 million. Sweeteners and starches decreased $57 million due to the impact of higher net corn costs partially offset by higher average sweetener and starches selling prices. Bioproducts operating profit decreased $719 million for the year as ethanol and lysine margins declined significantly due to higher corn costs and lower average selling prices. Ethanol margins were also impacted by lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices, and excess ethanol industry capacity. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Agricultural Services operating profits decreased 2% to $994 million. Merchandising and handling profit decreased $41 million. Merchandising margins moderated as demand for commodities slowed following the downturn in the global economy. Transportation results increased $18 million due to higher barge freight rates. Other operating profits decreased 101% to a loss of $6 million. Wheat, cocoa, malt, and sugar processing operating profit decreased $166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa and wheat processing margins. Financial operating profit decreased $263 million due to losses on managed fund investments compared to gains for the year ended June 30, 2008, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income and lower marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage service business. Corporate results increased $898 million to $81 million, primarily due to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations which resulted in credits of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $569 million of LIFO charges for the year ended June 30, 2008. Unallocated interest expense increased $238 million primarily due to higher long term debt interest expense and decreased interest income. Corporate interest income decreased due to lower short term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments. The Companys effective tax rate during 2009 was 32.6% compared to 31.3% during 2008. Income taxes increased $5 million. Lower pre tax earnings and positive impacts from favorable changes in geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and return to provision adjustments, were offset by charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. 2008 Compared to 2007 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Strong demand for agricultural commodities and processed products challenged the global supply chain and provided exceptional margin opportunities in 2008. Strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and strong fertilizer demand in South America positively impacted Oilseeds Processing results. The market price of corn rose due to increased demand, resulting in higher raw material costs for Corn Processing which were only partially passed on in the form of increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Average ethanol selling prices decreased due to additional supply entering the market. Large North American crops combined with global wheat shortages created favorable conditions in agricultural merchandising and handling operations. Increased commodity costs resulted in larger LIFO inventory valuation reserves. Earnings before income taxes decreased due principally to gains totaling $1.0 billion before income tax on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the exchange of the Companys interest in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International Limited (the Wilmar gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 include a charge of $569 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a charge of $207 million in 2007. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 also include a $32 million charge related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, a $38 million gain on sales of securities, and a $21 million gain on the disposal of long lived assets. Earnings before income taxes for 2007 include charges of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures and $21 million related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 727 $ 414 $ 313 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 181 202 (21 ) Asia 132 523 (391 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 1,040 1,139 (99 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 557 510 47 Bioproducts 404 595 (191 ) Total Corn Processing 961 1,105 (144 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 873 382 491 Transportation 144 156 (12 ) Total Agricultural Services 1,017 538 479 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 217 209 8 Financial 206 170 36 Total Other 423 379 44 Total Segment Operating Profit 3,441 3,161 280 Corporate (817 ) (7 ) (810 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,624 $ 3,154 $ (530 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion were comparable to 2008. Decreased employee related costs and favorable impacts from foreign currency translation were offset by increases in provisions for doubtful accounts. Other (income) expense net decreased $344 million primarily due to decreased results from equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $270 million, and decreased investment income. Equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates included $275 million of foreign exchange derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2009 2008 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 767 $ 727 $ 40 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 265 181 84 Asia 248 132 116 Total Oilseeds Processing 1,280 1,040 240 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 500 557 (57 ) Bioproducts (315 ) 404 (719 ) Total Corn Processing 185 961 (776 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 832 873 (41 ) Transportation 162 144 18 Total Agricultural Services 994 1,017 (23 ) Other Wheat, Cocoa, Malt & Sugar 51 217 (166 ) Financial (57 ) 206 (263 ) Total Other (6 ) 423 (429 ) Total Segment Operating Profit 2,453 3,441 (988 ) Corporate 81 (817 ) 898 Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,534 $ 2,624 $ (90 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 23% to $1.3 billion. Crushing and origination results increased $40 million. Improved global crushing margins were partially offset by lower fertilizer sales volumes and margins and lower North American crushing volumes due to decreased demand for vegetable oil and protein meal. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $84 million due principally to higher biodiesel sales volumes in South America and increased average margins for value added products. 2008 results for refining, packaging, biodiesel and other included asset abandonment charges of $27 million. Asia results increased $116 million due principally to the Companys share in improved operating results of Wilmar International Limited. Corn Processing operating profits decreased 81% to $185 million. Sweeteners and starches decreased $57 million due to the impact of higher net corn costs partially offset by higher average sweetener and starches selling prices. Bioproducts operating profit decreased $719 million for the year as ethanol and lysine margins declined significantly due to higher corn costs and lower average selling prices. Ethanol margins were also impacted by lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices, and excess ethanol industry capacity. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Agricultural Services operating profits decreased 2% to $994 million. Merchandising and handling profit decreased $41 million. Merchandising margins moderated as demand for commodities slowed following the downturn in the global economy. Transportation results increased $18 million due to higher barge freight rates. Other operating profits decreased 101% to a loss of $6 million. Wheat, cocoa, malt, and sugar processing operating profit decreased $166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa and wheat processing margins. Financial operating profit decreased $263 million due to losses on managed fund investments compared to gains for the year ended June 30, 2008, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income and lower marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage service business. Corporate results increased $898 million to $81 million, primarily due to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations which resulted in credits of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $569 million of LIFO charges for the year ended June 30, 2008. Unallocated interest expense increased $238 million primarily due to higher long term debt interest expense and decreased interest income. Corporate interest income decreased due to lower short term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments. The Companys effective tax rate during 2009 was 32.6% compared to 31.3% during 2008. Income taxes increased $5 million. Lower pre tax earnings and positive impacts from favorable changes in geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and return to provision adjustments, were offset by charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. 2008 Compared to 2007 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Strong demand for agricultural commodities and processed products challenged the global supply chain and provided exceptional margin opportunities in 2008. Strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and strong fertilizer demand in South America positively impacted Oilseeds Processing results. The market price of corn rose due to increased demand, resulting in higher raw material costs for Corn Processing which were only partially passed on in the form of increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Average ethanol selling prices decreased due to additional supply entering the market. Large North American crops combined with global wheat shortages created favorable conditions in agricultural merchandising and handling operations. Increased commodity costs resulted in larger LIFO inventory valuation reserves. Earnings before income taxes decreased due principally to gains totaling $1.0 billion before income tax on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the exchange of the Companys interest in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International Limited (the Wilmar gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 include a charge of $569 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a charge of $207 million in 2007. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 also include a $32 million charge related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, a $38 million gain on sales of securities, and a $21 million gain on the disposal of long lived assets. Earnings before income taxes for 2007 include charges of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures and $21 million related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007.

Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Agricultural Services operating profits decreased 2% to $994 million. Merchandising and handling profit decreased $41 million. Merchandising margins moderated as demand for commodities slowed following the downturn in the global economy. Transportation results increased $18 million due to higher barge freight rates. Other operating profits decreased 101% to a loss of $6 million. Wheat, cocoa, malt, and sugar processing operating profit decreased $166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa and wheat processing margins. Financial operating profit decreased $263 million due to losses on managed fund investments compared to gains for the year ended June 30, 2008, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income and lower marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage service business. Corporate results increased $898 million to $81 million, primarily due to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations which resulted in credits of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $569 million of LIFO charges for the year ended June 30, 2008. Unallocated interest expense increased $238 million primarily due to higher long term debt interest expense and decreased interest income. Corporate interest income decreased due to lower short term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments. The Companys effective tax rate during 2009 was 32.6% compared to 31.3% during 2008. Income taxes increased $5 million. Lower pre tax earnings and positive impacts from favorable changes in geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and return to provision adjustments, were offset by charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited. 2008 Compared to 2007 As an agricultural commodity based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results. Strong demand for agricultural commodities and processed products challenged the global supply chain and provided exceptional margin opportunities in 2008. Strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and strong fertilizer demand in South America positively impacted Oilseeds Processing results. The market price of corn rose due to increased demand, resulting in higher raw material costs for Corn Processing which were only partially passed on in the form of increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches. Average ethanol selling prices decreased due to additional supply entering the market. Large North American crops combined with global wheat shortages created favorable conditions in agricultural merchandising and handling operations. Increased commodity costs resulted in larger LIFO inventory valuation reserves. Earnings before income taxes decreased due principally to gains totaling $1.0 billion before income tax on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the exchange of the Companys interest in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International Limited (the Wilmar gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 include a charge of $569 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a charge of $207 million in 2007. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 also include a $32 million charge related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, a $38 million gain on sales of securities, and a $21 million gain on the disposal of long lived assets. Earnings before income taxes for 2007 include charges of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures and $21 million related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 727 $ 414 $ 313 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 181 202 (21 ) Asia 132 523 (391 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 1,040 1,139 (99 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 557 510 47 Bioproducts 404 595 (191 ) Total Corn Processing 961 1,105 (144 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 873 382 491 Transportation 144 156 (12 ) Total Agricultural Services 1,017 538 479 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 217 209 8 Financial 206 170 36 Total Other 423 379 44 Total Segment Operating Profit 3,441 3,161 280 Corporate (817 ) (7 ) (810 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,624 $ 3,154 $ (530 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Analysis of Statements of Earnings Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion. Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 14,477 $ 8,036 $ 6,441 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 8,588 5,758 2,830 Asia 214 149 65 Total Oilseeds Processing 23,279 13,943 9,336 Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 3,546 2,761 785 Bioproducts 3,591 3,064 527 Total Corn Processing 7,137 5,825 1,312 Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 33,749 20,222 13,527 Transportation 219 197 22 Total Agricultural Services 33,968 20,419 13,549 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 5,335 3,738 1,597 Financial 97 93 4 Total Other 5,432 3,831 1,601 Total $ 69,816 $ 44,018 $ 25,798 Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal. Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased. Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion. Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices. Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices. Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly opened markets in the southeastern United States. Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products. Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes. Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation. In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 727 $ 414 $ 313 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 181 202 (21 ) Asia 132 523 (391 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 1,040 1,139 (99 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 557 510 47 Bioproducts 404 595 (191 ) Total Corn Processing 961 1,105 (144 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 873 382 491 Transportation 144 156 (12 ) Total Agricultural Services 1,017 538 479 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 217 209 8 Financial 206 170 36 Total Other 423 379 44 Total Segment Operating Profit 3,441 3,161 280 Corporate (817 ) (7 ) (810 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,624 $ 3,154 $ (530 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations. Other (income) expense net decreased $911 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures. Other (income) expense net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write down of long lived assets, and a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007. Operating profit by segment is as follows: 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Oilseeds Processing Crushing & Origination $ 727 $ 414 $ 313 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel & Other 181 202 (21 ) Asia 132 523 (391 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 1,040 1,139 (99 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners & Starches 557 510 47 Bioproducts 404 595 (191 ) Total Corn Processing 961 1,105 (144 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising & Handling 873 382 491 Transportation 144 156 (12 ) Total Agricultural Services 1,017 538 479 Other Wheat, Cocoa & Malt 217 209 8 Financial 206 170 36 Total Other 423 379 44 Total Segment Operating Profit 3,441 3,161 280 Corporate (817 ) (7 ) (810 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 2,624 $ 3,154 $ (530 ) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer. Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins. 2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 million gain on a business disposal. Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes. Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million. This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs. Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business. Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market. Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business. Corporate expense increased $810 million to $817 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a $51 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs, partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures. Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings. The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.3% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.5%. Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity based business. At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1. Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year. This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices. Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year. Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year. In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long term debt compared to $101 million in total net long term borrowings in 2009. As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused.

Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.5 billion. The Companys ratio of long term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long term debt and shareholders equity) was 37% at June 30, 2009 and 36% at June 30, 2008. This ratio is a measure of the Companys long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused. Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009. Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A 1, P 1, and F1, respectively, and rate the Companys long term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively. In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets. The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied. The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes. As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes. In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8). The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock. Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future. The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period. Purchases include commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities. The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility. Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table. Item 7.

Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above. The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets. At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million. The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments. The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation. The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million. Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses. These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management. Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies. Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements. Inventories and Derivatives Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values. These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing. Management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets. Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially. The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol. The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits. Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan. Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula. The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage). In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. Management also uses third party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Income Taxes The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement. Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable. Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements. Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates.

The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products. These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective. Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available for sale and carries these securities at fair value. The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices. For non publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estimates of sales proceeds. In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below. Commodities The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts. The Company will also use exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins. The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from time to time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange traded futures and exchange traded and over the counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ 845 $ 85 $ 1,260 $ 126 Lowest position (1,342 ) (134 ) (915 ) (92 ) Average position (392 ) (39 ) 251 25 The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position. Currencies The Company conducts its business in many countries. For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar. The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange traded futures contracts, and over the counter options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Actual results may differ. Interest The fair value of the Companys long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates. Actual results may differ. 2009 2008 (In millions) Fair value of long term debt $ 8,103 $ 7,789 Excess of fair value over carrying value 303 99 Market risk 310 308 The increase in fair value of long term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products. This business is global in nature and is highly capital intensive. Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products. Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories. The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.
