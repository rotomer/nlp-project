EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our fiscal 2006 results were terrific. Consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 grew 11%, to $8,881.5 million, as compared to $7,983.7 million in fiscal 2005, which surpassed our original expectations. Employer Services revenues increased 10% for the year. Employer Services new business sales, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, grew 13% worldwide to approximately $950 million, in fiscal 2006 with sales growth of 28% worldwide in the fourth quarter, our strongest quarterly sales growth in nearly nine years. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and net earnings from continuing operations increased 9% and 7%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 9%, to $1.85 in fiscal 2006, from $1.69 per share in fiscal 2005 on fewer shares outstanding. These results were impacted by our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R using the modified prospective method, effective July 1, 2005, which required the expensing of our stock compensation programs. On a comparable basis, including stock compensation expense in fiscal 2005, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 23% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 25% from $1.48 per share in fiscal 2005. 15 Our diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2006 was $2.68, which includes earnings from discontinued operations. On April 13, 2006, we completed the sale of the Claims Services business, which was previously reported in our Other segment, for $975 million. In addition, on January 20, 2006, we completed the sale of our Brokerage Services financial print business. In connection with the sale of both of these businesses, we have classified the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations. The sale of the Claims Services business resulted in a gain of $561 million, or $453 million after tax. With the proceeds received in the United States from the sale of the Claims Services business and our cash flows from operations we accelerated our share buy back activity and acquired over 29 million of our shares for treasury for approximately $1,327 million, demonstrating our confidence in the long term growth prospects of our business. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities increased $380 million, to $1,813 million in fiscal 2006 from $1,433 million in fiscal 2005. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities for all businesses, excluding the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment, increased $66 million, to $1,692 million in fiscal 2006 from $1,626 million in fiscal 2005. Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid with cash and marketable securities of $2,602.5 million at June 30, 2006. We are pleased with our strong results in each of our business segments during fiscal 2006. Employer Services revenues grew 10% for fiscal 2006. We credit Employer Services with interest revenues at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. During fiscal 2006, Employer Services grew average client funds balances 11% as a result of new business and growth in our existing client base. The increase in average client funds balances resulted in an increase of interest revenues within Employer Services, which accounted for approximately 1% growth in Employer Services revenues as compared to fiscal 2005. The key metrics in Employer Services were the strongest they have been in six years. The number of employees on our clients payrolls, pays per control, increased in all market segments with 2.4% overall growth in the United States, and client retention improved by 0.2 percentage points worldwide over last years record level. Brokerage Services revenues grew 10% for the fiscal year. Revenue growth was primarily from our investor communications business as the volume of pieces delivered increased 8%, driven by an increase in mutual fund meetings and other required mutual fund communications, as well as 4% stock record growth. Back office average trades per day increased 16% for the fiscal year, but the volume increase was offset by a decline in average revenues per trade of 10%. Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services revenues were $80.6 million for fiscal 2006 as compared to $61.5 for the period from its acquisition date of November 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005. Dealer Services revenues grew 14% for fiscal 2006 primarily due to the effect of acquisitions. Our fiscal 2007 guidance is revenue growth of approximately 10% and earnings per share growth of 17% to 20%, from our earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.85 reported in fiscal 2006. We are anticipating pretax margin improvement of about 100 basis points in each of our businesses. Our plans reflect strong momentum in Employer Services, with about 11% revenue growth in the United States and 10% worldwide, double digit new business sales growth (annualized recurring revenue from new orders) and continued improvement in client retention. We anticipate 4% to 5% revenue growth in Brokerage Services and 12% to 13% revenue growth in Dealer Services in fiscal 2007. Interest income on client funds is anticipated to grow approximately 20% based on expected growth of nearly 10% in client funds balances and an improvement of 40 basis points in the overall average interest rate earned on our client funds portfolio to 4.5%. 16 Lastly, on August 2, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a plan to spin off the Brokerage Services Group business, comprised of Brokerage Services and Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services, into an independent publicly traded company through a tax free spin off of 100% of Brokerage Services Group to ADP shareholders. The spin off is subject to required regulatory approvals and reviews. We expect to complete the separation before the end of fiscal 2007. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, Change 2005 As 2005 As 2006 vs 2005 As 2006 vs 2005 As 2006 Reported Adjusted Reported Adjusted Total revenues $ 8,881.5 $ 7,983.7 $ 7,983.7 11 % 11% Total expenses $ 7,138.5 $ 6,390.6 $ 6,563.6 12 % 9% Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,743.0 $ 1,593.1 $ 1,420.1 9 % 23% Margin 20 % 20 % 18 % Provision for income taxes $ 670.6 $ 594.8 $ 546.3 13 % 23% Effective tax rate 38.5 % 37.3 % 38.5 % Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,072.4 $ 998.3 $ 873.8 7 % 23% Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.85 $ 1.69 $ 1.48 9 % 25% The comparison between the results of operations for fiscal 2006 and 2005 is affected by the impact of our adoption of SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), effective July 1, 2005, using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated. We believe the inclusion of the 2005 As Adjusted amounts provides a useful additional perspective to compare the results of operations for fiscal 2006 and 2005 as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We use both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non GAAP measures to manage and evaluate the Companys performance and consider it appropriate to disclose these non GAAP measures to assist investors with analyzing business performance and trends. However, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the results of operations and diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of stock based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. Prior to July 1, 2005, we followed Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25), and related interpretations. Under APB No. 25, no stock based compensation expense was recognized related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan, as all options granted under the stock option program had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and, with respect to the employee stock purchase plan, the discount did not exceed fifteen percent. Stock based compensation expense for our restricted stock program has historically been recognized in our results of operations in accordance with APB No. 25. The following table summarizes the stock 17 based compensation expense related to our stock option program, the employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock program that have been recorded in earnings from continuing operations in each respective period: (In millions) Years ended June 30, 2006 2005 Operating expenses $ 30.9 $ Selling, general and administrative expenses 105.6 14.0 Systems development and programming costs 31.9 Total stock based compensation expense reported in net earnings from continuing operations $ 168.4 $ 14.0 Income tax benefit on stock based compensation expense reported in net earnings from continuing operations $ (49.3 ) $ (5.5 ) In order to provide a comparable basis between the results of operations for fiscal 2006 and 2005, we have provided pro forma information, reflected under the heading 2005 As Adjusted, to provide the fiscal 2005 results as if stock based compensation expense related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan had been expensed. The 2005 As Adjusted amounts include the following pro forma stock based compensation expense related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan, which are based on the pro forma amounts disclosed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included with this Annual Report on Form 10 K: (In millions) Year ended June 30, 2005 Operating expenses $ 38.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 92.8 Systems development and programming costs 41.4 Total pro forma stock based compensation expense $ 173.0 Pro forma income tax benefit on stock based compensation expense $ (48.5 ) Total Revenues Our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2006 grew 11% to $8,881.5 million primarily due to increases in Employer Services of 10%, or $502.1 million, to $5,763.4 million, Brokerage Services of 10%, or $173.9 million, to $1,852.8 million, Dealer Services of 14%, or $141.8 million, to $1,132.4 million, as well as $80.6 million from the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment. Our consolidated revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, grew 10% in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year. 18 Our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2006 include interest on funds held for Employer Services clients of $549.8 million as compared to $421.4 million in the prior year. The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for Employer Services clients resulted from the increase of 11% in our average client funds balances to $13.6 billion, as well as the increase in the average interest rate earned on client funds from 3.4% in fiscal 2005 to 4.1% in fiscal 2006. Total Expenses, As Reported Our consolidated expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by $747.9 million, to $7,138.5 million, from $6,390.6 million, as reported, for fiscal 2005. The increase in our consolidated expenses is primarily due to the inclusion of stock based compensation expenses in our results of operations as of July 1, 2005 associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, as discussed above, as well as the increase in our revenues. Total stock based compensation expense included in continuing operations increased $154.4 million, to $168.4 million, in fiscal 2006, from $14.0 million, as reported, in fiscal 2005 due to the recording of expenses within our results of operations for our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan. Consolidated expenses decreased by $8.7 million, or 0.1%, due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating expenses increased by $524.7 million, or 14%, primarily due to the increase in revenues, including the increases in the PEO business and investor communications activity, which both have pass through costs. The pass through costs for these two services were $1,145.6 million and $979.2 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, our operating expenses increased as a result of our investment in personnel to support the implementation services related to new sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $202.3 million, to $2,035.1 million, primarily attributable to the increase in stock based compensation expense of $91.6 million in fiscal 2006 and increased compensation costs associated with our continued investment in our sales personnel to drive our revenue growth. Systems development and programming costs increased by $39.5 million, to $589.8 million, primarily due to stock based compensation expense of $31.9 million in fiscal 2006 and increased compensation expenses associated with personnel to support and maintain our products and services. In addition, other income, net, increased $33.3 million primarily due to the increase in interest income on corporate funds of $49.9 million as a result of the increase in the average interest rate earned on our corporate investments from 2.9% in fiscal 2005 to 3.9% in fiscal 2006 and a reduction in the net realized losses on available for sale securities of $23.9 million. These favorable increases were offset by additional interest expense of $40.5 million primarily as a result of higher interest rates on our short term financing arrangements. Total Expenses, As Adjusted Our consolidated expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by $574.9 million, to $7,138.5 million, from $6,563.6 million, as adjusted, for fiscal 2005. Total stock based compensation expense included in continuing operations decreased $18.6 million, to $168.4 million in fiscal 2006, from $187.0 million, as adjusted, in fiscal 2005. This decrease was primarily driven by the reduction in the number of stock options granted to associates, which began in fiscal 2005. Consolidated expenses decreased by $8.7 million, or 0.1%, due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating expenses increased by $485.9 million, or 13%, primarily due to the increase in revenues, including the increases in the PEO business and investor communications activity, which both have pass through costs. The pass through costs for these two services were $1,145.6 million and $979.2 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, our operating expenses increased as a result of our investment in personnel to support the implementation of the new sales being generated. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $109.5 million, to $2,035.1 million, primarily attributable to the increase in compensation costs associated with our continued investment in our sales personnel to drive our revenue 19 growth. Systems development and programming costs decreased by $1.9 million, to $589.8 million, primarily due to a decrease of $9.5 million in stock based compensation expenses offset by increased compensation expenses associated with personnel to support and maintain our products and services. In addition, other income, net, increased $33.3 million primarily due to the increase in interest income on corporate funds of $49.9 million as a result of the increase in the average interest rate earned on our corporate investments from 2.9% in fiscal 2005 to 3.9% in fiscal 2006 and a reduction in the net realized losses on available for sale securities of $23.9 million. These favorable increases were offset by additional interest expense of $40.5 million primarily as a result of higher interest rates on our short term financing arrangements. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes, As Reported Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased by $149.9 million, or 9%, from $1,593.1 million, as reported, during fiscal 2005 to $1,743.0 million during fiscal 2006 due to the increase in revenues and expenses discussed above. Overall margin remained flat at 20%. We have leveraged our expense levels with the increasing revenues, in order to improve margins on our services. The improved margins on our services was offset by the increase in our stock compensation expenses of $154.4 million due to the recording of stock based compensation expense associated with our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan during fiscal 2006. Additionally, our margin was negatively impacted by the increasing PEO business revenues, which have pass through operating expenses and therefore lower margins. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes, As Adjusted Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased by $322.9 million, or 23%, from $1,420.1 million, as adjusted, during fiscal 2005 to $1,743.0 million during fiscal 2006 due to the increase in revenues and expenses discussed above. Overall margin improved from 18% to 20%. We have leveraged our expense levels with the increasing revenues, in order to improve margins on our services as well as decrease total stock based compensation expense primarily due to the reduction in the number of stock options granted to associates. In addition, our margin was negatively impacted by the increasing PEO business revenues, which have pass through operating expenses and therefore lower margins. Provision for Income Taxes, As Reported Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was 38.5% as compared to 37.3%, as reported, for fiscal 2005. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the expensing of stock based compensation, as certain components of our stock based compensation programs are non deductible, resulting in a higher effective tax rate. In addition, the effective tax rate increased due to the application of the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the AJCA) to our repatriation of approximately $250 million of eligible dividends from non U.S. subsidiaries which resulted in income tax expense of approximately $10 million during fiscal 2006. These increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by a favorable mix in income among tax jurisdictions. 20 Provision for Income Taxes, As Adjusted Our effective tax rate was 38.5% for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, as adjusted. Certain components of our stock based compensation programs are non deductible, which results in a higher effective tax rate. For fiscal 2006 our non deductible stock based compensation expense decreased and our overall earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased, both of which contributed to a lower effective tax rate for fiscal 2006. In addition, the decrease in the effective tax rate was partially due to a favorable mix in income among tax jurisdictions. These decreases were offset by additional income tax expense of approximately $10 million during fiscal 2006 associated with the repatriation of approximately $250 million of eligible dividends from non U.S. subsidiaries under the AJCA. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations, As Reported Net earnings from continuing operations increased 7%, to $1,072.4 million, during fiscal 2006, from $998.3 million, as reported, during fiscal 2005 and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 9%, to $1.85. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations reflects the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as a result of increased revenues offset by the additional expense associated with stock based compensation and a higher effective tax rate as described above. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 29.6 million shares during fiscal 2006 and 14.1 million shares during fiscal 2005. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations, As Adjusted Net earnings from continuing operations increased 23%, to $1,072.4 million, during fiscal 2006, from $873.8 million, as adjusted, during fiscal 2005. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 25%, to $1.85 for fiscal 2006 from $1.48, as adjusted, for fiscal 2005. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations reflects the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as a result of our higher revenues and improved margin, as described above. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 29.6 million shares during fiscal 2006 and 14.1 million shares during fiscal 2005. 21 Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, Change 2005 As 2004 As 2005 vs 2004 As Reported Reported Reported Total revenues $ 7,983.7 $ 7,279.4 10% Total expenses $ 6,390.6 $ 5,844.5 9% Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,593.1 $ 1,434.9 11% Margin 20.0 % 19.7 % Provision for income taxes $ 594.8 $ 537.2 11% Effective tax rate 37.3 % 37.4 % Net earnings from continuing operations $ 998.3 $ 897.7 11% Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.69 $ 1.50 13% Total Revenues Our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2005 grew 10%, to $7,983.7 million, as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increases in Employer Services of 8%, or $389.8 million, to $5,261.3 million, Brokerage Services of 6%, or $92.4 million, to $1,678.9 million, Dealer Services of 10%, or $90.3 million, to $990.6 million, as well as $61.5 million from our Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment for the period of November 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005. Our consolidated revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, grew 9% in fiscal 2005 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Revenue growth for fiscal 2005 was also favorably impacted by $91.4 million, or 1.3%, due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2005 include interest on funds held for Employer Services clients of $421.4 million, as compared to $355.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for Employer Services clients was primarily due to the increase of 11% in our average client funds balances in fiscal 2005 to $12.3 billion as a result of Employer Services new business and growth in our existing client base. Total Expenses Our consolidated expenses for fiscal 2005 increased by $546.1 million, from $5,844.5 million to $6,390.6 million. The increase in our consolidated expenses is primarily due to the increase in operating expenses associated with the growth of our revenues, including the additional expenses associated with acquisitions. In addition, consolidated expenses increased by $76.5 million, or 1.3%, due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our consolidated expenses did not increase comparably with our revenue primarily due to the leveraging of our increasing revenues within our Employer Services and Brokerage Services businesses. Operating expenses increased by $456.1 million, or 14%, primarily due to the increase in operating personnel to support the revenue growth. In addition, our operating 22 expenses grew at a faster rate than revenue growth primarily due to the higher growth rates of our PEO business and investor communications activity, which both have pass through costs. The pass through costs for these two services were $979.2 million in fiscal 2005, as compared to $862.6 million in fiscal 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $43.1 million, to $1,832.8 million, primarily due to the increase in sales personnel in our Employer Services and Dealer Services businesses to support the revenue growth. Systems development and programming costs increased by $26.6 million, to $550.3 million, due to continued investments in sustaining our products, primarily in our Employer Services business, and the maintenance of our existing technology throughout all of our businesses. In addition, other income, net decreased $23.5 million primarily due to the increase in interest expense of $16.3 million, which resulted from higher interest rates on our short term financing arrangements and an increase of $20.9 million in net realized losses on our available for sale securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased by $158.2 million, or 11%, to $1,593.1 million during fiscal 2005 due to the increase in revenues and expenses discussed above. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 37.3%, as compared to 37.4% for fiscal 2004. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a favorable mix in income among tax jurisdictions. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 increased by 11%, to $998.3 million, from $897.7 million, and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 13%, to $1.69. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 reflects the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the impact of the lower effective tax rate. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 14.1 million shares during fiscal 2005 and 15.8 million shares during fiscal 2004. 23 ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Revenues (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Employer Services $5,763.4 $5,261.3 $4,871.5 10 % 8 % 9 % Brokerage Services 1,852.8 1,678.9 1,586.5 10 % 6 % 3 % Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services 80.6 61.5 31 % Dealer Services 1,132.4 990.6 900.3 14 % 10 % 9 % Other 73.1 84.5 109.5 (13 )% (23 )% 14 % Reconciling items: Foreign exchange 36.0 33.3 (47.9 ) Client funds interest (56.8 ) (126.4 ) (140.5 ) Total revenues $8,881.5 $7,983.7 $7,279.4 11 % 10 % 9 % Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Employer Services $1,308.4 $1,149.3 $998.0 14 % 15 % (7 )% Brokerage Services 339.5 301.1 250.8 13 % 20 % 2 % Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services (30.3 ) (23.6 ) (28 ) % Dealer Services 161.1 149.8 145.3 7 % 3 % 6 % Other (135.1 ) 2.6 62.9 (100 )+% (96 )% (35 )% Reconciling items: Foreign exchange 12.2 5.8 (7.1 ) Client funds interest (56.8 ) (126.4 ) (140.5 ) Cost of capital charge 144.0 134.5 125.5 Total earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $1,743.0 $1,593.1 $1,434.9 9 % 11 % (10 )% Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons.

The fiscal 2005 and 2004 reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal 2006 budgeted foreign exchange rates. This adjustment is made for management purposes so that the reportable segments 24 revenues are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This adjustment is a reconciling item to revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in order to eliminate the adjustment in consolidation. In addition, the reconciling items include an adjustment for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. This allocation is made for management reasons so that the Employer Services results are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. This allocation is a reconciling item to our reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes to eliminate the allocation in consolidation. The reportable segments results also include a cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. This charge is a reconciling item to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes to eliminate the charge in consolidation. Employer Services Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenues Employer Services revenues increased 10% in fiscal 2006 primarily due to new business started in the period, an increase in the number of employees on our clients payrolls in the United States, strong client retention, a pricing increase of approximately 2% and an increase in client funds balances, which increased interest revenues. Internal revenue growth, which represents revenue growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was approximately 10% for fiscal 2006. New business sales, which represent the annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, grew 13% worldwide, to approximately $950 million, for fiscal 2006 due to the increased growth in the salesforce and its productivity. The number of employees on our clients payrolls, pays per control, increased 2.4% in the United States. This employment metric represents over 125 thousand payrolls of small to very large businesses and reflects a broad range of U.S. geographies. Our client retention in the United States and worldwide each improved by 0.2 percentage points over last years record level. We credit Employer Services with interest revenues at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. The difference between the 4.5% standard rate allocation in Employer Services and the actual interest earned is a reconciling item that reduces revenue by $56.8 million and $126.4 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, to eliminate this allocation in consolidation. Interest revenues at Employer Services increased by $58.8 million in fiscal 2006, which accounted for approximately 1% growth in Employer Services revenues, due to the increase in the average client funds balances as a result of increased Employer Services new business and growth in our existing client base. The average client funds balances were $13.6 billion during fiscal 2006 as compared to $12.3 billion during fiscal 2005, representing an increase of 11%. Revenues from our beyond payroll products continued to grow at a faster rate than the traditional payroll and payroll tax revenues. Our PEO revenues grew 22%, to $703.7 million, due to 22% growth in the number of PEO worksite employees during fiscal 2006 and additional pass through benefits. In addition, beyond payroll revenues grew due to a 21% increase in revenues from our Time and Labor Management Services due to increases in the number of clients utilizing this service. 25 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 14%, from $1,149.3 million to $1,308.4 million, for fiscal 2006 primarily due to the increase in revenues. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes grew at a faster rate than revenues primarily due to the improvement in margins of our products from the leveraging of our expense structure with the increased revenues offset, in part, by higher selling expenses associated with additional personnel expenses resulting from the increase in implementation and salesforce personnel and higher commission expenses resulting from our increase in new business sales. In addition, expenses in fiscal 2006 increased due to start up expenses relating to GlobalView (SM), our HR outsourcing offering for multi national organizations based on SAPs industry leading HR business solutions. Lastly, our operating expenses increased comparably with our revenue growth due to increases in our PEO business, which includes pass through costs associated with the services. Our PEO revenues and pass through operating expenses related to benefits and workers compensation costs grew 22% and 21%, respectively, to $703.7 million and $510.9 million, respectively, in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenues Employer Services revenues increased 8% in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to new business started in fiscal 2005, a pricing increase of approximately 2%, an increase in the number of employees on our clients payrolls in the United States, strong client retention, and an increase in client funds balances, which increased interest revenues. Internal revenue growth, which represents revenue growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was approximately 8% for fiscal 2005. New business sales grew 13%, to approximately $840 million, for fiscal 2005 due to the increased growth in the salesforce and its productivity. The number of employees on our clients payrolls, pays per control, increased approximately 1.9% for fiscal 2005 in the United States. Our client retention in the United States improved by 0.5 percentage points from the record retention levels in fiscal 2004 primarily due to our continued investment and commitment to client service. We credit Employer Services with interest revenues at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. The difference between the 4.5% standard rate allocation to Employer Services and the actual interest earned is a reconciling item that reduces revenues by $126.4 million and $140.5 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively, to eliminate this allocation in consolidation. In fiscal 2005, interest revenues increased due to the growth in the average client funds balances as a result of increased Employer Services new business and growth in our existing client base as compared to fiscal 2004. This interest revenue increase accounted for approximately 1% growth in Employer Services revenues as compared to fiscal 2004. The average client funds balance was $12.3 billion during fiscal 2005 as compared to $11.1 billion for the prior fiscal year, representing an increase of 11% for fiscal 2005. Revenues from our beyond payroll products continued to grow at a faster rate than the traditional payroll and payroll tax revenues. Our PEO revenues grew 24%, to $577.0 million, during fiscal 2005 primarily due to 21% growth in the number of PEO worksite employees and additional pass through benefits. In addition, beyond payroll revenues grew due to a 13% increase in revenues from our TotalPay Services and a 22% increase in revenues from our Time and Labor Management Services, both due to the increase in the number of clients utilizing these services. 26 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 15%, from $998.0 million to $1,149.3 million, for fiscal 2005 primarily due to the increase in revenues. Our operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the increase in operating and sales personnel to support the revenue growth. In addition, the increase in operating expenses exceeded our revenue growth due to the higher growth in our PEO business, which includes pass through costs associated with the services. Our PEO revenues and pass through operating expenses related to benefits and workers compensation costs each grew 24% to $577.0 million and $422.6 million, respectively, in fiscal 2005. The increase in PEO operating expenses was partially offset by efficiencies of scale in operating expenses in our Employer Services business. Our systems development and programming costs increased due to the continued maintenance of our products and services to comply with statutory requirements and to support our revenue growth. Our total expenses at Employer Services did not increase comparably with our revenue growth primarily due to the leveraging of our increasing revenues, which has resulted in improved margins for our services. This was primarily due to the increase in the efficiency of our sales personnel, which resulted in a decline of our selling expenses as a percentage of new business sales in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. In addition, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased approximately $17.1 million during fiscal 2005 as a result of the completion of the integration of certain acquisitions, primarily ProBusiness Services, Inc., in the prior fiscal year. Brokerage Services Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenues Brokerage Services revenues increased 10% for fiscal 2006 due to the increase in certain investor communication activities and back office services revenues. Revenues from our beneficial proxy and interim communications increased 7%, to $738.1 million, primarily due to increased mutual fund meeting activity and other required mutual fund communications. Revenues from our beyond beneficial products grew 21%, to $644.1 million, primarily from sales and internal revenue growth within our transaction reporting, electronic solutions and fulfillment products and the related postage revenue for these services. Stock record growth, which is a measure of how many stockholders own a security compared to the prior year and a key factor in the number of pieces delivered, increased 4% in fiscal 2006. Our number of pieces delivered increased 8%, from 995 million to 1,074 million, for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 driven by higher volumes from mutual fund meetings and other required mutual fund communications. Our back office services revenues increased 1%, to $356.2 million, due to an increase in back office average trades per day of 16%, from 1.5 million to 1.7 million, offset by a decrease in the average revenue per trade of 10% and a decrease in non trade revenues. The decrease in the average revenue per trade was primarily due to our tiered pricing agreements and an increase in lower priced electronic retail and institutional trades. 27 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $38.4 million, or 13%, to $339.5 million for fiscal 2006 primarily due to the revenue growth in our investor communications activities. Additionally, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were favorably impacted by the improvement in the margin of our back office services products due to the continued efforts to align our operating expenses to back office revenues and our overall cost containment measures. These increases were offset by the decrease in margin on postage revenues due to the mix of investor communications mailings and an increase in various selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to increased compensation expenses relating to sales personnel and increased commission expenses associated with our increased revenues. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenues Brokerage Services revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to an increase in certain investor communications activities as well as an increase in our back office services revenues. Revenues from investor communications for fiscal 2005 increased by 9%, to $1,222.3 million, primarily due to increases in the volume of our proxy and interim communications services, as well as increases in our distribution services revenues. Our proxy and interim communications pieces delivered increased 15%, from 865 million to 995 million, for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in the fiscal 2005 proxy and interim communications activity resulted from more holders of equities, increased activity related to additional mutual fund meetings, and more mutual fund special communications. Stock record growth increased 6% in fiscal 2005. Our distribution services revenues increased due to new business growth for post sale mutual fund services. In addition, there was an increased demand for our services for the consolidation or electronic delivery of proxies, which increased our service fee revenues, but lowered our postage revenues. Our back office services revenues increased by 0.5%, to $352.1 million, for fiscal 2005 due to an increase in non trade revenues offset by a decrease in trade processing revenues. The average revenue per trade declined 10% for fiscal 2005 primarily due to our client mix, which was driven by the increase in electronic retail trades and volume processed under tiered pricing agreements. These decreases were offset by an increase in the average trades per day of 7%, from 1.4 million in fiscal 2004 to 1.5 million in fiscal 2005. Average trades per day increased primarily due to net new business sales and growth in our existing client base. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $50.3 million, to $301.1 million, for fiscal 2005 primarily due to the increased revenues in our investor communications activities and improved margins for our back office services. With the increase in volume of our investor communications, we were able to leverage our expense structure to improve our margins associated with such services. In addition, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were favorably impacted by an increase in our services to consolidate or electronically deliver proxies, which is a higher margin service. The margin on our back office services improved due to the continued alignment of our operating expenses to the lower back office revenues. Earnings from continuing operations before 28 income taxes also increased approximately $8.2 million during fiscal 2005 as a result of the elimination of unprofitable business lines and alignment of our cost structure in our underperforming businesses that occurred during fiscal year 2004. Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenues Revenues for Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services were $80.6 million for fiscal 2006 as compared with $61.5 million for the period from its acquisition date of November 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005. Fiscal 2006 revenues decreased as compared with annualized fiscal 2005 revenues primarily due to the planned deconversion of two correspondent clearing clients at the end of fiscal 2005 offset, in part, by the increase in outsourcing revenue of approximately $16 million in fiscal 2006. Average margin balances were $617 million during fiscal 2006 and $955 million during the period from its acquisition date of November 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005. Average number of trades cleared per day during fiscal 2006 was 20 thousand as compared with 23 thousand for the period from its acquisition date of November 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005. Loss from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $30.3 million for fiscal 2006 as compared with $23.6 million for the period from its acquisition date of November 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005. The loss for fiscal 2006 is lower than the annualized loss from the eight months of fiscal 2005 due to the efforts to reduce operational costs in order to align the cost structure of the business to the current revenue levels. The fiscal 2006 loss from continuing operations before income taxes is primarily due to continued integration and transition expenses, which decreased in the second half of fiscal 2006 as compared to the similar period in the prior year, and higher compensation costs to support the start up of new Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services clients. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenues On November 1, 2004, the Company formed the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment upon the acquisition of the U.S. Clearing and BrokerDealer Services divisions of Bank of America Corporation (U.S. Clearing and BrokerDealer Business). Revenues for Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services were $61.5 million from November 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005. Average customer margin balances were $955 million and the average number of trades cleared per day was 23 thousand from November 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005. Loss from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $23.6 million from November 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005 due to the current alignment of the cost structure associated with the revenues of the segment as well as the integration costs incurred since the acquisition of the business. 29 Dealer Services Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenues Dealer Services revenues increased 14% for fiscal 2006 as compared with the prior year. Internal revenue growth was approximately 4% in fiscal 2006. Revenues increased for our dealer business systems in North America by $44.5 million, to $860.2 million, primarily due to growth in our key products. The growth in our key products was primarily driven by the increased users for Application Service Provider (ASP) managed services, increased Credit Check and CVR transaction volume, new network installations and increased market penetration of our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) product. Our revenues for fiscal 2006 were also impacted by acquisitions, primarily Kerridge Computer Company Ltd (Kerridge) in December 2005, which is an international dealer management systems provider to auto dealers. Our acquisitions contributed approximately 10% to our revenue growth for fiscal 2006. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $11.3 million, to $161.1 million, for fiscal 2006. The increases in revenues of our dealer business systems and contributions from recent acquisitions have increased earnings in fiscal 2006. These increases were partially offset by additional sales expenses relating to sales personnel headcount additions. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were also negatively impacted by the integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Kerridge, including $5.6 million of severance expenses relating to certain ADP associates. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenues Dealer Services revenues increased 10% for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Internal revenue growth was approximately 6% for fiscal 2005. Revenues increased 13% for our dealer business systems in North America to $815.7 million for fiscal 2005 primarily due to growth in our key products and the effect of acquisitions. The growth in our key products was primarily driven by the increased users for ASP managed services, increased Credit Check installations, new network installations and increased market penetration of our CRM product. In addition, our revenue growth was impacted by our continued strong client retention. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $4.5 million, to $149.8 million, for fiscal 2005 primarily due to increases in revenues of our dealer business systems offset by the additional sales expenses relating to headcount additions to generate the current revenue growth and additional implementation expenses to support the new sales contracts awarded during fiscal 2005 30 for two of the largest dealership groups in the United States. In addition, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were negatively impacted by the integration costs of acquisitions that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Other The primary components of Other are miscellaneous processing services, and corporate allocations and expenses, including stock based compensation expense related to the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 123R, effective July 1, 2005, of $168.4 million, $14.0 million and $12.3 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our financial condition and balance sheet remain strong. At June 30, 2006, cash and marketable securities were $2,602.5 million. The ratio of long term debt to equity was 1.2% at June 30, 2006. At June 30, 2006, working capital was $2,167.4 million, as compared to $2,008.1 million at June 30, 2005. The increase in working capital arose primarily as a result of the increase in cash and cash equivalents associated with the proceeds received from the sale of the Claims Services business, offset by the reduction in the net assets of the Claims Services business. Our principal sources of liquidity are derived from cash generated through operations and our cash and marketable securities on hand. We also have the ability to generate cash through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short term repurchase agreements. In addition, we have three unsecured revolving credit agreements that allow us to borrow up to $5.5 billion in the aggregate. Our short term commercial paper program and repurchase agreements are utilized as the primary instruments to meet short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our revolving credit agreements are in place to provide additional liquidity, if needed. We have never had borrowings under the revolving credit agreements. The Company believes that the internally generated cash flows and financing arrangements are adequate to support business operations and capital expenditures. On April 13, 2006, we completed the sale of our Claims Services business for $975 million in cash, which resulted in a gain of $561 million, or $453 million after tax, and net cash from the transaction of approximately $760 million. A portion of the transaction proceeds were received outside of the United States. With the sale of the Claims Services business we accelerated our share buy back activity, using a portion of the proceeds received in the United States from the sale of this business to purchase shares. On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for the Company to repatriate earnings accumulated outside the U.S. by allowing the Company to reduce its taxable income by 85 percent of certain eligible dividends received from non U.S. subsidiaries by the end of the Companys fiscal year ending June 30, 2006. In connection with the sale of the Claims Services Business on April 13, 2006 and receipt of the related proceeds, the Company elected to apply the provisions of the AJCA to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal 2006. As approved by our Board of Directors in June 2006, approximately $250 million was repatriated under the AJCA. Income tax expense of approximately $10 million associated with this repatriation was recorded in the fourth quarter. On November 1, 2004, we acquired the U.S. Clearing and BrokerDealer Business and formed the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment to report the results of the acquired business. The Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment provides third party clearing operations in 31 the regulated broker dealer industry. The cash flows from operations from this business differ from that of our other businesses because the broker dealer third party clearing activities utilize payables to finance their business activities and the regulations associated with the broker dealer industry require cash or securities to be segregated for the exclusive benefit of customers in certain circumstances based on regulatory calculations driven by customers balances. As a result, management analyzes cash flows provided from operating activities of the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment separately from all other businesses. Managements view of the net cash flows provided by operating activities is as follows: (In millions) Years ended June 30, 2006 2005 2004 Net cash flows provided by operating activities for all businesses, excluding the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment $1,691.8 $1,626.4 $1,385.4 Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities for the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment 120.7 (193.0 ) Net cash flows provided by operating activities, as reported $1,812.5 $1,433.4 $1,385.4 Net cash flows provided by operating activities for all businesses, excluding the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment, were $1,691.8 million in fiscal 2006, as compared to $1,626.4 million in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net earnings from all businesses, excluding the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment, of $501.8 million offset by the non cash gain on the sale of the Claims Services Business of $452.8 million. Additionally, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased primarily due to the timing of income tax payments, which increased from approximately $476.8 million in fiscal 2005 to $675.6 million in fiscal 2006, offset in part by an increase in our income tax provision. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment were $120.7 million in fiscal 2006 as compared with the net cash flows used in operating activities of $193.0 million from November 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005. The net cash flows provided by operating activities primarily resulted from a decrease of $164.4 million of securities deposited with clearing organizations or segregated for the exclusive benefit of our Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services customers to meet regulatory requirements. In addition, securities clearing receivables decreased primarily due to the margin lending activities of the segment. Cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal 2006 totaled $452.2 million, as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $437.9 million in fiscal 2005. The fluctuation between periods was primarily due to the proceeds received from our sale of the Claims Services business and the Brokerage Services financial print business during fiscal 2006. Additionally, the fluctuations in cash flows from investing activities were due to the timing of purchases of and proceeds from marketable securities and the change in client funds obligations. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2006 totaled $1,348.8 million, as compared to $746.5 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the increase in the amount of common stock purchased for treasury. With a portion of the proceeds received in the United States from the sale of the Claims Services business and our cash flows from operations we accelerated our share buy back activity and purchased 29.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $44.84 per share during fiscal 2006, as compared with 14.1 million shares at an average 32 price of $41.98 per share during fiscal 2005. As of June 30, 2006, we had remaining Board of Directors authorization to purchase up to 34.0 million additional shares. The increase in the cash flows used from financing activities was offset, in part, by an increase in the proceeds received from the stock purchase plan and exercises of stock options in fiscal 2006. In June 2006, we entered into a $1.75 billion, 364 day credit agreement and a $2.25 billion, five year credit agreement with a group of lenders. The five year facility contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million to $2.75 billion, subject to the availability of additional commitments. These facilities replaced the Companys prior $1.25 billion, 364 day facility, and $2.25 billion, five year facility, both of which were terminated on June 28, 2006. The $1.75 billion and $2.25 billion agreements mature in June 2007 and June 2011, respectively. We also have a $1.5 billion credit facility that matures in June 2010. The interest rate applicable to the borrowings is tied to LIBOR or prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. We are also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and to provide funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. There were no borrowings through June 30, 2006 under the current or prior credit agreements. We maintain a U.S. short term commercial paper program providing for the issuance of up to $5.0 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper at the Companys discretion. Our commercial paper program is rated A 1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime 1 by Moodys. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 270 days. At June 30, 2006 and 2005, there was no commercial paper outstanding. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Companys average borrowings were $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and 2.1%, respectively. The weighted average maturity of the Companys commercial paper during fiscal 2006 and 2005 was less than two days for both fiscal years. Our U.S. and Canadian short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. At June 30, 2006 and 2005, there were no outstanding obligations under repurchase agreements. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Company had average outstanding balances under repurchase agreements of $165.7 million and $300.2 million, respectively, at an average interest rate of 3.5% and 1.9%, respectively. During fiscal 2006, we borrowed $200.1 million from a financial institution on a short term basis in connection with Dealer Services acquisition of Kerridge Computer Company Ltd. We repaid the short term borrowing in full as of December 31, 2005. Capital expenditures for continuing operations during fiscal 2006 were $289.2 million, as compared to $194.1 million in fiscal 2005 and $188.0 million in fiscal 2004. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 related primarily to data center and other facility improvements to support our operations. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 to be approximately $250 million. 33 The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2006: (In millions) Payments due by period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations 1 year years years 5 years Total Debt Obligations (1) $ 0.2 $ 16.7 $ $ 57.6 $ 74.5 Operating Lease and Software License Obligations (2) 309.3 390.2 162.9 81.0 943.4 Purchase Obligations (3) 99.0 84.8 59.2 1.6 244.6 Other long term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets: Compensation and Benefits (4) 28.9 95.0 49.1 72.8 245.8 Total $ 437.4 $ 586.7 $ 271.2 $ 213.0 $ 1,508.3 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters. (2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment and other assets. (4) Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we have obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2006, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2007, total $17,787.4 million and are recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have $17,483.9 million of cash and marketable securities recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2006 that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations. The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, ADP Indemnity, Inc., provides workers compensation and employer liability insurance coverage for our PEO worksite employees. We have secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss reinsurance from third party carriers that cap losses that reach a certain level in each policy year. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO business. We review the assumptions and obtain valuations provided by an independent third party actuary to determine the adequacy of the workers compensation reserve. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we received premiums of $46.5 million and $54.0 million, respectively, and paid claims of $21.9 million and $15.9 million, respectively. At June 30, 2006, our cash balances and marketable securities balances totaled approximately $148.5 million to cover potential future workers compensation claims for the policy years that the PEO worksite employees were covered by ADP Indemnity, Inc. We believe that the workers compensation reserve is adequate to cover the workers compensation claim liability for the PEO worksite employees covered. 34 It is not the Companys business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements. However, in the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Companys products and services. In addition, the securities transactions of the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment involve collateral arrangements required by various regulatory and internal guidelines, which are monitored daily. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties or collateral arrangements. We are a member of numerous exchanges and clearinghouses. Under the membership agreements, members are generally required to guarantee the performance of other members. Additionally, if a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearinghouse, other members would be required to meet these shortfalls. To mitigate these performance risks, the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to post collateral. Our maximum potential liability under these arrangements cannot be quantified. However, we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make payments under these arrangements. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the consolidated financial statements for these arrangements. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities, and long term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees). In order to provide more cost effective liquidity and maximize our interest income, we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short term financing arrangements to satisfy our short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. In these instances, a portion of this portfolio is considered and reported within the corporate investment balances in order to reflect the pure client funds assets and related obligations. Interest income on this portfolio and the related interest expense on the borrowings are reported in other income, net on our Statements of Consolidated Earnings. Our corporate investments are invested in highly liquid, investment grade securities. These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. The majority of our short term and long term marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities. Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals, while also seeking to maximize interest income. Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment grade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at time of purchase. A significant portion of the client funds assets are invested in U.S. government agencies securities. We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating for fixed income securities is single A. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for a single A rated security is 5 years, for AA rated securities is 7 years, and for AAA rated securities is 10 years. Commercial paper must be rated A1/P1 and, for time deposits, banks must have a Financial Strength Rating of C or better. 35 Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, 2006 2005 2004 Average investment balances at cost: Corporate investments $ 3,587.3 $ 3,143.1 $ 3,131.3 Funds held for clients 13,566.1 12,263.9 11,086.8 Total $ 17,153.4 $ 15,407.0 $ 14,218.1 Average interest rates earned exclusive of realized gains/ (losses) on: Corporate investments 3.9 % 2.9 % 2.5 % Funds held for clients 4.1 % 3.4 % 3.2 % Total 4.0 % 3.3 % 3.0 % Realized gains on available for sale securities $ 13.3 $ 10.7 $ 9.7 Realized losses on available for sale securities (17.9 ) (39.2 ) (17.3 ) Net realized losses $ (4.6 ) $ (28.5 ) $ (7.6 ) As of June 30: Net unrealized pre tax (losses) gains on available for sale securities $ (312.9 ) $ 32.9 $ 59.9 Total available for sale securities at fair value $ 13,612.8 $ 13,001.5 $ 12,092.8 During fiscal 2006, approximately 20% of our overall investment portfolio was invested in cash and cash equivalents and, therefore, is impacted by changes in short term interest rates. The other 80% of our investment portfolio was invested in fixed income securities, with varying maturities of 10 years or less, which were also subject to interest rate risk including reinvestment risk. Factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short term and long term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. A hypothetical change in both short term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or Fed Funds rates) and intermediate term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated fiscal 2007 average investment balances and any related borrowings would result in approximately a $10 million impact to earnings before income taxes over a twelve month period. A hypothetical change in only short term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated fiscal 2007 average short term investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a $4 million impact to earnings before income taxes over a twelve month period. The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. The Company limits credit risk by investing primarily in AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors, and for Canadian securities, Dominion Bond Rating Service. In addition, we also limit amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. At June 30, 2006, approximately 95% of our available for sale securities held a AAA or AA rating. 36 The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. In the normal course of business, the securities clearing activities of the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment provides trade execution, settlement and financing of various security clearing transactions for a nationwide client base. With these activities, we may be exposed to risk in the event customers, other broker dealers, banks, clearing organizations or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations. For securities clearing activities of the Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment in which we extend credit to customers and broker dealers, we seek to control the risk associated with these activities by requiring customers and broker dealers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines. We monitor margin levels and, pursuant to such guidelines, request the deposit of additional collateral or the reduction of securities positions, when necessary. In addition, broker dealers may be required to maintain deposits relating to any securities clearing activities we perform on their behalf. We record customers security clearing transactions on a settlement date basis, which is generally three business days after trade date. The Company is therefore exposed to off balance sheet risk of loss on unsettled transactions in the event customers and other counterparties are unable to fulfill contractual obligations. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As previously discussed, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment effective July 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method. The adoption of this standard requires the measurement of stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 applies to all tax positions accounted for under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes and defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements. The interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained then no benefits of the position are to be recognized. FIN 48 requires additional annual disclosures and is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS No. 154), which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle and error corrections. SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted SFAS No. 154 on July 1, 2006 and will apply its provisions on a prospective basis when applicable. 37 In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of SFAS No. 143 (FIN 47). FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 as of June 30, 2006 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., Employer Services payroll processing fees and Brokerage Services trade processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services client related funds. We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of trades). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions which do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties. Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for Employer Services clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. We also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses. For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation and post contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition. We assess collectibility of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. We do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectibility determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. 38 Goodwill. We review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. When determining fair value, we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long term growth rates, estimated costs, and appropriate discount rates based on the Companys weighted average cost of capital. Our estimates of long term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine long range planning process. We had $2,466.2 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2006. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated earnings. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123R requires the measurement of stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binominal option pricing model. The binomial option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Companys stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. Prior to July 1, 2005, we followed APB No. 25, and related interpretations. Under APB No. 25, no stock based compensation expense was recognized related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan, as all options granted under the stock option program had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and, with respect to the employee stock purchase plan, the discount did not exceed fifteen percent.
