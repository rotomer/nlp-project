DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS ADP is one of the worlds largest providers of business outsourcing solutions. Leveraging more than 55 years of experience, ADP offers a wide range of HR, payroll, tax and benefits administration solutions from a single source. ADP is also a leading provider of integrated computing solutions to automotive, heavy truck, motorcycle, marine and recreational vehicle dealers throughout the world. In fiscal 2007, the Company implemented several key changes to its operations, including the spin off of its former Brokerage Services Group business on March 30, 2007. In addition, there were changes in the Companys executive management team. As a result of these changes, the Company reassessed its reportable segments under SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and determined that Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services should be a reportable segment in addition to Employer Services and Dealer Services. Based upon similar economic characteristics and operational characteristics, the Companys strategic business units are aggregated into the following three reportable segments: Employer Services, PEO Services and Dealer Services. The Company has restated its previously reported segment results for all periods presented to reflect this change in the Companys reportable segments. A brief description of each segments operations is provided below. Employer Services Employer Services offers a comprehensive range of human resource (HR) information, payroll processing, tax and benefits administration products and services, including traditional and Web based outsourcing solutions, that assist approximately 560,000 employers in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America (primarily Brazil), Australia and Asia to staff, manage, pay and retain their employees. Employer Services categorizes its services between traditional payroll and payroll tax, and beyond payroll. The traditional payroll and payroll tax business represents the Companys core payroll processing and payroll tax filing business. The beyond payroll business represents the services that extend beyond the traditional payroll and payroll tax filing services, such as Time and 14 Labor Management and benefit and retirement administration. Within Employer Services, the Company collects client funds and remits such funds to tax authorities for payroll tax filing and payment services, and to employees of payroll services clients. PEO Services PEO Services provides over 4,500 small and medium sized businesses with comprehensive employment administration outsourcing solutions through a co employment relationship, including payroll, payroll tax filing, HR guidance, 401(k) plan administration, benefits administration, compliance services, health and workers compensation coverage and other supplemental benefits for employees. Dealer Services Dealer Services provides integrated dealer management systems (such a system is also known in the industry as a DMS) and business solutions to automotive, heavy truck and powersports (i.e., motorcycle, marine and recreational) vehicle retailers in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Asia and Europe. Over 25,000 automotive, heavy truck and powersports dealers in over 50 countries use our DMS, other software based solutions, networking solutions, data integration, consulting and or marketing services. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Consolidated revenues from continuing operations in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 (fiscal 2007) grew 14%, to $7,800.0 million, as compared to $6,835.6 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 (fiscal 2006). Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and net earnings from continuing operations increased 19% and 21%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 26%, to $1.83 in fiscal 2007, from $1.45 per share in fiscal 2006, on fewer shares outstanding. We are pleased with our strong results in each of our business segments in fiscal 2007. Employer Services revenues increased 11% and PEO Services revenues increased 26% in fiscal 2007. Employer Services and PEO Services new business sales, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, grew 11% worldwide, to approximately $1,055.1 million in fiscal 2007. This represents the third straight year of double digit sales growth. In fiscal 2007, Employer Services grew average client funds balances 8% as a result of new business and growth in our existing client base. The increase in average client funds balances resulted in an increase in interest revenues within Employer Services, which accounted for approximately 1% growth in Employer Services revenues as compared to fiscal 2006. The number of employees on our clients payrolls, pays per control, increased in all market segments with 2.3% overall growth in the United States, and client retention improved 0.1 percentage point worldwide over last years record level. PEO Services revenues grew 26% in fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 22% increase in the average number of worksite employees. Dealer Services revenues grew 14% in fiscal 2007 due to internal revenue growth and the effect of acquisitions. Additionally, we were very pleased to have completed the tax free spin off of our former Brokerage Services Group business, as well as the sales of certain non strategic, slow growing businesses. The new ADP is a more focused company, which we believe has excellent growth potential for revenue and pretax earnings. 15 On March 30, 2007, we completed the tax free spin off of our former Brokerage Services Group business, comprised of our former Brokerage Services and Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segments, into an independent publicly traded company called Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (Broadridge). As a result of the spin off, ADP stockholders of record on March 23, 2007 (the record date) received one share of Broadridge common stock for every four shares of ADP common stock held by them on the record date and cash for any fractional shares of Broadridge common stock. We have classified the results of operations of the spun off business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, we recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $1,125.2 million for the non cash reduction in net assets of Broadridge related to the spin off, offset by an increase to retained earnings of $690.0 million related to the cash dividend received from Broadridge as part of the spin off. On January 23, 2007, the Company completed the sale of Sandy Corporation, a business within the Dealer Services segment that specializes in sales and marketing training, for approximately $4.0 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities by the buyer, plus an additional earn out payment if certain revenue targets are achieved. The Company reported a gain of $11.2 million, or $6.9 million after tax within earnings from discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. The Company has classified the results of operations of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. On June 30, 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Travel Clearing business for approximately $116 million in cash. We completed the sale of this business on July 6, 2007. The Travel Clearing business was previously reported in the Other segment. In connection with the disposal of this business, we have classified the results of operations of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. We expect to record a gain of approximately $55 million to $65 million, after taxes, which we will classify as discontinued operations in fiscal 2008. Such gain is exclusive of a working capital adjustment to the original purchase price. This working capital adjustment is expected to be finalized in fiscal 2008 and will increase or decrease the gain accordingly. With the cash dividend from the spin off of our former Brokerage Services Group business and our cash flows from operations, we continued our accelerated share buyback program and acquired over 40 million of our shares for treasury for over $1.9 billion. These share repurchases, along with our repurchase of over 29 million shares in fiscal 2006, demonstrate our confidence in ADPs future growth opportunities. Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid with cash and marketable securities of $1,884.6 million at June 30, 2007. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $514.5 million, to $1,298.0 million in fiscal 2007, from $1,812.5 million in fiscal 2006 as a result of a decrease in the operating activities of discontinued operations of $186.1 million, as well as an increase of $247.2 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $116.2 million in other assets. The increase in accounts receivable was related to our increased revenues and the timing of collections. The increase in other assets was largely due to a $17.4 million increase in our pension plan cash contributions and a $62.3 million increase in other current assets due to the timing of certain payments for prepaid insurance and software maintenance contracts in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. 16 RESULTS OF OPERATIONSANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, Change 2007 2006 2007 vs 2006 Total revenues $ 7,800.0 $ 6,835.6 14 % Costs of revenues: Operating expenses 3,392.3 2,970.5 14 % Systems development and programming costs 486.1 472.3 3 % Depreciation and amortization 208.9 160.9 30 % Total cost of revenues 4,087.3 3,603.7 13 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,206.2 1,933.7 14 % Interest expense 94.9 72.8 30 % Total expenses 6,388.4 5,610.2 14 % Other income, net 211.9 135.8 56 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,623.5 $ 1,361.2 19 % Margin 21 % 20 % Provision for income taxes $ 602.3 $ 519.3 16 % Effective tax rate 37.1 % 38.2 % Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,021.2 $ 841.9 21 % Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.83 $ 1.45 26 % Total Revenues Our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 grew 14%, to $7,800.0, million due to increases in Employer Services of 11%, or $539.0 million, to $5,615.4 million, PEO Services of 26%, or $181.1 million, to $884.8 million, and Dealer Services of 14%, or $153.0 million, to $1,225.8 million. Our consolidated revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, grew 12% in fiscal 2007 as compared to the prior year. Revenue growth was also favorably impacted by $81.1 million, or 1%, due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 include interest on funds held for clients of $653.6 million as compared to $549.8 million in the prior year. The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the increase of 8% in our average client funds balances to $14.7 billion, as well as the increase in the average interest rate earned to approximately 4.5% in fiscal 2007 as compared to 4.1% in fiscal 2006. 17 Total Expenses Our consolidated expenses increased $778.2 million, from $5,610.2 million in fiscal 2006, to $6,388.4 million in fiscal 2007. The percentage increase in our consolidated expenses was proportionate to the increase in our revenues. Additionally, the increase was due to higher pass through costs associated with our PEO business revenues, which have pass through operating expenses, an increase in our salesforce and implementation personnel, higher expenses associated with our Employer Services new business sales and implementation and the impact of acquisitions. Consolidated expenses also increased $79.8 million, or 1%, due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our total cost of revenues increased $483.6 million, to $4,087.3 million in fiscal 2007, from $3,603.7 million in fiscal 2006, due to increases in our operating expenses. Operating expenses increased $421.8 million, due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO revenues, which have pass through costs that are re billable, and higher compensation expenses associated with additional implementation and service personnel. The pass through costs for our PEO revenues were $640.7 million in fiscal 2007, as compared to $511.0 million in fiscal 2006. In addition, operating expenses in fiscal 2007 increased approximately $136.0 million as a result of higher compensation expenses associated with additional implementation and service personnel, including approximately $47.0 million of spending on new business opportunities in Employer Services and PEO Services. Our new business opportunities relate to our Human Resource Business Process Outsourcing (HR BPO) opportunities, which focus on the outsourcing of integrated multiple processes such as payroll, HR, and benefits administration. This spending was targeted at expanding our Comprehensive Outsourcing Services (COS) product for larger employers, our PEO Services business, our ADP Resource product, which is an integrated, flexible HR and payroll based service offering, and GlobalView, which is our outsourcing offering for multi national and global organizations. Lastly, our operating expenses increased $30.0 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates and increased approximately $64.6 million due to the operating costs of new businesses acquired. Systems development and programming costs increased $20.4 million due to the increase in headcount and the additional expenses associated with our new businesses acquired and increased $6.1 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These increases in systems development and programming costs were offset by lower compensation expenses of approximately $16.0 million associated with the increased resources at our off shore locations and smartshoring facilities. In addition, depreciation and amortization expenses increased $48.0 million due to increased amortization expenses of $28.2 million resulting from the intangible assets acquired with new businesses and the purchases of software and software licenses in fiscal 2007. In addition, depreciation and amortization expenses increased due to fiscal 2006 capital expenditures of approximately $100 million related to the consolidation of our data center facilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $272.5 million, to $2,206.2 million in fiscal 2007, due to higher selling expenses in Employer Services and PEO Services, which resulted in an increase in expenses of approximately $97.5 million and $18.3 million, respectively. The $97.5 million increase in expenses in Employer Services includes approximately $13 million for expenses relating to our HR BPO opportunities discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased approximately $73.8 million due to the selling, general and administrative expenses related to our business acquisitions in fiscal 2007 and increased $20.1 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Additionally, we had an increase in restructuring charges of $21.5 million, which primarily related to severance. 18 Interest expense increased $22.1 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of higher average borrowings and higher interest rates on our short term commercial paper program. In fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Companys average borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and 4.1%, respectively. Other Income, net Other income, net, increased $76.1 million in fiscal 2007 due to a gain of $38.6 million on the sale of a minority investment, an increase of $7.5 million of realized gains on our available for sale securities and a decrease of $5.4 million of realized losses on our available for sale securities. Additionally, other income, net, included an increase in interest income on corporate funds of $24.6 million as a result of the higher average interest rates earned on our corporate balances, which increased to 4.6% in fiscal 2007 as compared to 4.0% in the prior year and our average corporate balances increased to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2007 as compared to $3.5 billion in the prior year. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $262.3 million, or 19%, to $1,623.5 million in fiscal 2007 due to the increase in revenues and expenses discussed above. Overall margin increased from 20% in fiscal 2006 to 21% in fiscal 2007. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 was 37.1%, as compared to 38.2% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to a favorable mix in income among tax jurisdictions and to $10.0 million of income tax expense recorded in fiscal 2006 for the repatriation in fiscal 2006 of approximately $250.0 million of eligible dividends from non U.S. subsidiaries. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2007 increased 21%, to $1,021.2 million, from $841.9 million in fiscal 2006, and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 26%, to $1.83. The diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.83 includes a net one time gain of approximately $20.3 million, net of taxes, from the sale of a Dealer Services non core minority investment, offset by restructuring charges, which was accretive to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately $0.03 per share. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2007 reflects the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as a result of increased revenues offset by expenses and a lower effective tax rate. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2007 reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 40.2 million shares in fiscal 2007 and 29.6 million shares in fiscal 2006. 19 Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, Change Change 2006 As 2005 As 2005 As 2006 vs 2005 2006 vs 2005 Reported Reported Adjusted As Reported As Adjusted Total revenues $ 6,835.6 $ 6,131.3 $ 6,131.3 11 % 11 % Costs of revenues: Operating expenses 2,970.5 2,588.1 2,619.9 15 % 13 % Systems development and programming costs 472.3 426.6 458.8 11 % 3 % Depreciation and amortization 160.9 150.6 150.6 7 % 7 % Total cost of revenues 3,603.7 3,165.3 3,229.3 14 % 12 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,933.7 1,758.6 1,839.6 10 % 5 % Interest expense 72.8 32.3 32.3 125 % 125 % Total expenses 5,610.2 4,956.2 5,101.2 13 % 10 % Other income, net 135.8 62.7 62.7 117 % 117 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,361.2 $ 1,237.8 $ 1,092.8 10 % 25 % Margin 20 % 20 % 18 % Provision for income taxes $ 519.3 $ 457.2 $ 415.7 14 % 25 % Effective tax rate 38.2 % 36.9 % 38.0 % Net earnings from continuing operations $ 841.9 $ 780.6 $ 677.1 8 % 24 % Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.45 $ 1.32 $ 1.15 10 % 26 % The comparison between the results of operations in fiscal 2006 and 2005 is affected by the impact of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), effective July 1, 2005, using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated. We believe the inclusion of the 2005 As Adjusted amounts provides a useful additional perspective to compare the results of operations in fiscal 2006 and 2005 as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We use both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non GAAP measures to manage and evaluate the Companys performance and consider it appropriate to disclose these non GAAP measures to assist investors with analyzing business performance and trends. However, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the results of operations and diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP. 20 The adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of stock based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. Prior to July 1, 2005, we followed Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25), and related interpretations. Under APB No. 25, no stock based compensation expense was recognized related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan, as all options granted under the stock option program had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and, with respect to the employee stock purchase plan, the discount did not exceed fifteen percent. Stock based compensation expense for our restricted stock program has historically been recognized in our results of operations in accordance with APB No. 25. The following table summarizes the stock based compensation expense related to our stock option program, the employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock program that have been recorded in earnings from continuing operations in each respective period: (In millions) Years ended June 30, 2006 2005 Operating expenses $ 23.7 $ Selling, general and administrative expenses 95.7 11.8 Systems development and programming costs 23.3 Total stock based compensation expense reported in net earnings from continuing operations $ 142.7 $ 11.8 Income tax benefit on stock based compensation expense reported in net earnings from continuing operations $ (41.7 ) $ (4.6 ) In order to provide a comparable basis between the results of operations in fiscal 2006 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 (fiscal 2005), we have provided pro forma information, reflected under the heading 2005 As Adjusted, to provide fiscal 2005 results as if stock based compensation expense related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan had been expensed. The 2005 As Adjusted amounts include the following pro forma stock based compensation expense related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan, which are based on the pro forma amounts disclosed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included with this Annual Report on Form 10 K: (In millions) Year ended June 30, 2005 Operating expenses $ 31.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 81.0 Systems development and programming costs 32.2 Total pro forma stock based compensation expense $ 145.0 Pro forma income tax benefit on stock based compensation expense $ (41.5 ) 21 Total Revenues Our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 grew 11%, to $6,835.6 million, as compared to our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, due to increases in Employer Services of 8%, or $376.7 million, to $5,076.4 million, PEO Services of 22%, or $126.7 million, to $703.7 million, and Dealer Services of 15%, or $136.2 million, to $1,072.8 million. Our consolidated revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, grew 10% in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year. Our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 include interest on funds held for clients of $549.8 million, as compared to $421.4 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients was due to the increase of 11% in our average client funds balances in fiscal 2006 to $13.6 billion as a result of new business and growth in our existing client base, as well as the increase in the average interest rate earned on client funds from 3.4% in fiscal 2005 to 4.1% in fiscal 2006. Total Expenses, As Reported Our consolidated expenses in fiscal 2006 increased $654.0 million, to $5,610.2 million, from $4,956.2 million in fiscal 2005, as reported, due to an increase in our revenues described above, an increase in our stock based compensation expense, and increases in our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in our stock based compensation expense in our results of operations as of July 1, 2005 is associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Total stock based compensation expense included in continuing operations increased $130.9 million, to $142.7 million, in fiscal 2006, from $11.8 million, as reported, in fiscal 2005 due to the recording of expenses within our results of operations for our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan. Our total cost of revenues increased $438.4 million, to $3,603.7 million in fiscal 2006, from $3,165.3 million in fiscal 2005, due to increases in our operating expenses and systems development and programming costs. Operating expenses increased $382.4 million, or 15%, due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increase in PEO revenues, which have pass through costs. The pass through costs associated with our PEO revenues increased $88.4 million in fiscal 2006, to $511.0 million. In addition, operating expenses increased approximately $95.3 million as a result of higher compensation expenses associated with additional implementation and service personnel. Lastly, our operating expenses increased $23.7 million due to the increase in stock based compensation expense in fiscal 2006. Systems development and programming costs increased $45.7 million, to $472.3 million, due to stock based compensation expense of $23.3 million recorded in fiscal 2006 and increased compensation expenses associated with personnel to support and maintain our products and services. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $175.1 million in fiscal 2006, to $1,933.7 million, attributable to the increase in stock based compensation expense of $83.9 million in fiscal 2006 and increased compensation costs of $77.8 million associated with our continued investment in our sales personnel to drive our revenue growth. Interest expense increased $40.5 million in fiscal 2006 as a result of higher interest rates and higher average borrowings on our short term commercial paper program. In fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Companys average borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and 2.1%, respectively. 22 Total Expenses, As Adjusted Our consolidated expenses in fiscal 2006 increased $509.0 million, to $5,610.2 million, from $5,101.2 million in fiscal 2005, as adjusted, due to increases in our costs of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. Total stock based compensation expense included in continuing operations decreased $14.1 million, to $142.7 million in fiscal 2006, from $156.8 million, as adjusted, in fiscal 2005. This decrease was driven by the reduction in the number of stock options granted to associates, which began in fiscal 2006. Our total cost of revenues increased $374.4 million, to $3,603.7 million in fiscal 2006, from $3,229.3 million in fiscal 2005, due to increases in our operating expenses and systems development and programming costs. Operating expenses increased $350.6 million, or 13%, due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increase in PEO revenues, which have pass through costs. The pass through costs associated with our PEO revenues increased $88.4 million in fiscal 2006, to $511.0 million. In addition, operating expenses increased approximately $95.3 million as a result of higher compensation expenses associated with additional implementation and service personnel. Systems development and programming costs increased $13.5 million, to $472.3 million, due to increased compensation expenses associated with personnel to support and maintain our products and services. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $94.1 million in fiscal 2006, to $1,933.7 million, attributable to increased compensation costs of $77.8 million associated with our continued investment in our sales personnel to drive our revenue growth. Interest expense increased $40.5 million in fiscal 2006 as a result of higher interest rates and higher average borrowings on our short term commercial paper program. In fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Companys average borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and 2.1%, respectively. Other Income, net Other income, net, increased $73.1 million in fiscal 2006 due to the increase in interest income on corporate funds of $49.2 million as a result of the increase in the average interest rate earned on our corporate investments from 3.0% in fiscal 2005 to 4.0% in fiscal 2006 and a decrease in the net realized losses on available for sale securities of $23.9 million. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes, As Reported Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $123.4 million, or 10%, from $1,237.8 million, as reported, in fiscal 2005 to $1,361.2 million in fiscal 2006 due to the increase in revenues and expenses discussed above. Overall margin remained flat at 20%. We leveraged our expense levels with the increasing revenues, in order to improve margins on our services. The improved margins on our services were offset by the increase in stock compensation expenses of $130.9 million due to the recording of stock based compensation expense associated with our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan in fiscal 2006. Additionally, our margin was negatively impacted by increasing PEO revenues, which have pass through operating expenses and therefore lower margins. 23 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes, As Adjusted Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $268.4 million, or 25%, from $1,092.8 million, as adjusted, in fiscal 2005 to $1,361.2 million in fiscal 2006 due to the increase in revenues and expenses discussed above. Overall margin improved from 18% to 20%. We leveraged our expense levels with the increasing revenues in order to improve margins on our services and total stock based compensation expense decreased due to the reduction in the number of stock options granted to associates. In addition, our margin was negatively impacted by the increasing PEO revenues, which have pass through operating expenses and therefore lower margins. Provision for Income Taxes, As Reported Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 was 38.2% as compared to 36.9%, as reported, in fiscal 2005. The increase in the effective tax rate is attributable to the expensing of stock based compensation, as certain components of our stock based compensation programs are non deductible, resulting in a higher effective tax rate. In addition, the effective tax rate increased due to the application of the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the AJCA) to our repatriation of approximately $250.0 million of eligible dividends from non U.S. subsidiaries, which resulted in income tax expense of approximately $10.0 million in fiscal 2006. These increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by a favorable mix in income among tax jurisdictions. Provision for Income Taxes, As Adjusted Our effective tax rate was 38.2% and 38.0% in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively, as adjusted. The increase in our effective tax rate was due to additional income tax expense of approximately $10.0 million in fiscal 2006 associated with the repatriation of approximately $250.0 million of eligible dividends from non U.S. subsidiaries under the AJCA. Certain components of our stock based compensation programs are non deductible, which results in a higher effective tax rate. In fiscal 2006, our non deductible stock based compensation expense decreased and our overall earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased, both of which offset the increase in the effective tax rate. In addition, the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a favorable mix in income among tax jurisdictions. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations, As Reported Net earnings from continuing operations increased 8%, to $841.9 million, in fiscal 2006, from $780.6 million, as reported, in fiscal 2005 and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 10%, to $1.45. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations reflects the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as a result of increased revenues offset by the additional expense associated with stock based compensation and a higher effective tax rate as described above. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 29.6 million shares in fiscal 2006 and 14.1 million shares in fiscal 2005. 24 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations, As Adjusted Net earnings from continuing operations increased 24%, to $841.9 million, in fiscal 2006, from $677.1 million, as adjusted, in fiscal 2005. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 26%, to $1.45 in fiscal 2006 from $1.15, as adjusted, in fiscal 2005. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations reflects the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as a result of our higher revenues and improved margin, as described above. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 29.6 million shares in fiscal 2006 and 14.1 million shares in fiscal 2005.

The fiscal 2006 and 2005 reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal 2007 budgeted foreign exchange rates. This adjustment is made for management purposes so that the reportable segments revenues are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This adjustment is a reconciling item to revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of this adjustment in consolidation. In addition, the reconciling items include an adjustment for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. This allocation is made for management reasons so that the reportable segments results are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. This allocation is a reconciling item to our reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of this allocation in consolidation. The reportable segments results also include a cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. This charge is a reconciling item to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of this charge in consolidation. Employer Services Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Revenues Employer Services revenues increased 11% in fiscal 2007 due to new business started in the period, an increase in the number of employees on our clients payrolls in the United States, increased client retention, the impact of pricing increases, which contributed approximately 2% to our revenue growth, and an increase in client funds balances, which increased interest revenues. Internal revenue growth, which represents revenue growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was approximately 9% for fiscal 2007. Revenue from our traditional payroll and payroll tax filing business grew 9%. The number of employees on our clients payrolls, pays per control, increased 2.3% in the United States. This employment metric represents over 141,000 payrolls of small to large businesses and reflects a broad range of U.S. geographic regions. Our worldwide client retention improved 0.1 percentage point over last years record level. Revenues from our beyond payroll services, excluding PEO Services, which is disclosed as a separate reportable segment, increased 18% in fiscal 2007, due to an increase in our Time and Labor Management services revenues of 22%, as well as the impact of certain business acquisitions in fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues related to our Time and Labor Management services was due to an increase in the number of clients utilizing these services. We credit Employer Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the Employer Services segment increased $48.8 million in fiscal 2007, which represented 1% growth in Employer Services revenues, due to the increase in the average client funds balances as a 26 result of increased Employer Services new business and growth in our existing client base. The average client funds balances were $14.6 billion in fiscal 2007 as compared to $13.5 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of 8%. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $153.8 million, or 12%, to $1,408.1 million, in fiscal 2007. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in fiscal 2007 grew at a faster rate than revenues due to the improvement in margins for our services from the leveraging of our expense structure with the increased revenues. This was offset, in part, by higher operating expenses from the increase of approximately $226.5 million in compensation expenses for implementation, service and salesforce personnel, and spending on new business opportunities related to our HR BPO offerings of approximately $7 million. This spending on new business opportunities was targeted at expanding our COS product for larger employers and our ADP Resource product, as well as our GlobalView product, which is our outsourcing offering for multi national and global organizations. Lastly, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were negatively impacted by approximately $8.4 million related to six acquisitions made in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenues Employer Services revenues increased 8% in fiscal 2006 due to new business started in the period, an increase in the number of employees on our clients payrolls in the United States, increased client retention, the impact of pricing increases, which contributed approximately 2% to our revenue growth, and an increase in client funds balances, which increased interest revenues. The number of employees on our clients payrolls, pays per control, increased 2.3% in the United States. Our worldwide client retention improved 0.1 percentage point over the record level in fiscal 2005. Revenues from our beyond payroll services, excluding PEO Services, which is disclosed as a separate reportable segment, increased 11% in fiscal 2006, due to an increase in our Time and Labor Management services revenues of 21% due to an increase in the number of client utilizing these services. We credit Employer Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the Employer Services segment increased $57.8 million in fiscal 2006, which represented approximately 1% growth in Employer Services revenues, due to the increase in the average client funds balances as a result of increased Employer Services new business and growth in our existing client base. The average client funds balances were $13.5 billion in fiscal 2006 as compared to $12.2 billion in fiscal 2005, representing an increase of 11%. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 13%, from $1,113.7 million to $1,254.3 million, in fiscal 2006 due to the increase in revenues. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes grew at a faster rate than revenues due to the improvement in margins for our services from the leveraging of our expense structure with the increased revenues offset, in part, by higher selling expenses associated with additional personnel expenses resulting from the increase in implementation and salesforce personnel and higher commission expenses resulting from our increase in new business sales. In addition, expenses in fiscal 2006 increased due to start up expenses relating to GlobalView. 27 PEO Services Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Revenues PEO Services revenues increased $181.1 million, or 26%, to $884.8 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues was primarily due to a 22% increase in the average number of worksite employees in fiscal 2007. The increase in the average number of worksite employees was due to new client sales, improved client retention and the net increase in the number of worksite employees at existing clients. Additionally, benefit related revenues, which are billed to our clients and therefore have an equal amount of costs in operating expenses, increased $112.5 million, or 29%, due to the increase in the average number of worksite employees in fiscal 2007, as well as increases in health care costs, which were passed on to clients. Administrative revenues, which represent the fees for our services, increased $33.8 million in fiscal 2007, or 24%, due to the increase in the number of average worksite employees and price increases, which are based upon a percentage of the salaries related to worksite employees. We credit PEO Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, PEO Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the PEO Services segment increased $1.2 million in fiscal 2007, due to the increase in the average client funds balances as a result of increased PEO Services new business and growth in our existing client base. The average client funds balances were $0.1 billion in both fiscal 2007 and 2006. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $25.5 million, or 46%, to $80.4 million in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues described above, net of the related cost of providing benefits and workers compensation coverage and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees, which are included in cost of revenues, and contributed to a $52.1 million increase in our earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to 22% growth in the average worksite employees, price increases, and improvement in margins on the workers compensation and state unemployment components of the PEO Services offering. The increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $52.1 million was partially offset by an increase in our cost of services of $9.8 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. In addition, our expenses associated with new business sales increased $12.2 million in fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of growth in our salesforce and an increase in sales over fiscal 2006 of 14%. Lastly, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million primarily as a result of the growth in the business. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenues PEO Services revenues increased $126.7 million, or 22%, to $703.7 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in revenues was primarily due to a 19% increase in the average number of worksite employees in fiscal 2006. The increase in the average number of worksite employees was due to new client sales and the net increase in worksite employees at existing clients. Additionally, benefit related revenues, which are billed to our clients and therefore have an equal amount of costs in operating expenses, increased 28 $85.8 million, or 28%, due to the increase in the average number of worksite employees as well as increases in health care costs, which were passed on to clients. Administrative revenues increased $19.9 million, or 16%, due to the increase in the average number of worksite employees. We credit PEO Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, PEO Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the PEO Services segment increased $1.0 million in fiscal 2007, due to the increase in the average client funds balances as a result of increased PEO Services new business and growth in our existing client base. The average client funds balances were $0.1 billion in both fiscal 2006 and 2005. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $15.1 million, or 38%, to $54.9 million in fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues described above, net of the related cost of providing benefits and workers compensation coverage and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees, which are included in cost of revenues, and contributed to a $37.1 million increase in our earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This increase is attributable to 19% growth in the average worksite employees and improvement in margins on the workers compensation and state unemployment components of the PEO Services product offering. The increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $37.1 million was partially offset by an increase in our cost of revenues of $10.8 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Lastly, our expenses associated with new business sales increased $14.3 million in fiscal 2006, primarily as a result of growth in our salesforce and an increase in sales over fiscal 2006 of 30%. Dealer Services Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Revenues Dealer Services revenues increased $153.0 million, or 14%, to $1,225.8 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues in fiscal 2007 was driven by both internal revenue growth and by acquisitions. Revenues increased for our dealer business systems in North America by $74.0 million, to $946.8 million, due to growth in our key services. The growth in our key services was driven by the increased users for Application Service Provider (ASP) managed services, increased Credit Check and Computerized Vehicle Registration (CVR) transaction volume, new network installations and increased market penetration of our Digital Marketing services. Internal revenue growth, which represents revenue growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was approximately 6% for fiscal 2007. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $42.1 million, to $200.0 million, in fiscal 2007, due to the increases in revenues of our dealer business systems and contributions from recent acquisitions. Overall margin improved to 16% in fiscal 2007, from 15% in fiscal 2006, driven by growth in the international market due to the acquisition of Kerridge in fiscal 2006 and cost savings achieved from the integration of Kerridge in the current year. Lastly, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes also improved as a result of a decline in restructuring expenses of $5.6 million, which represented the expenses recorded in the prior year relating to the integration of Kerridge. 29 Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenues Dealer Services revenues increased $136.2 million, or 15%, to $1,072.8 million in fiscal 2006. Revenues increased for our dealer business systems in North America by $42.3 million, to $872.8 million, due to growth in our key services. The growth in our key services was driven by the increased users for ASP managed services, increased Credit Check and CVR transaction volume, new network installations and increased market penetration of our Customer Relationship Management services. Internal revenue growth, which represents revenue growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was approximately 4% for fiscal 2006. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $9.1 million, to $157.9 million, in fiscal 2006. The increases in revenues of our dealer business systems and contributions from recent acquisitions increased earnings in fiscal 2006. These increases were partially offset by additional sales expenses relating to sales personnel headcount additions. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were also negatively impacted by the integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Kerridge, including $5.6 million of restructuring expenses. Other The primary components of Other are miscellaneous processing services, and corporate allocations and expenses, including stock based compensation expense reported in net earnings from continuing operations related to the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 123R, effective July 1, 2005, of $130.5 million, $142.7 million and $11.8 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, certain non recurring gains and losses, including a gain of $38.6 million on the sale of a minority interest investment in fiscal 2007 are included in Other. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our financial condition and balance sheet remain strong. At June 30, 2007, cash and marketable securities were $1,884.6 million. The ratio of long term debt to equity was 0.8% at June 30, 2007. At June 30, 2007, working capital from continuing operations was $1,534.8 million, as compared to $1,596.4 million at June 30, 2006. This fluctuation is due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of $54.0 million and $257.1 million, respectively. These decreases were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $289.7 million due to the increased revenues and the timing of collections. Our principal sources of liquidity are derived from cash generated through operations and through cash and marketable securities on hand. We also have the ability to generate cash through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short term repurchase agreements. In addition, we have three unsecured revolving credit agreements that allow us to borrow up to $5.5 billion in the aggregate. Our short term commercial paper program and repurchase agreements are utilized as the primary instruments to meet short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our revolving credit agreements are in place to provide additional liquidity, if needed. We have never had borrowings under the revolving credit agreements. The Company believes that the internally generated cash flows and financing arrangements are adequate to support business operations and capital expenditures. 30 On March 30, 2007, we completed the tax free spin off of our former Brokerage Services Group business, comprised of our former Brokerage Services and Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segments, into an independent publicly traded company called Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (Broadridge). As a result of the spin off, ADP stockholders of record on March 23, 2007 (the record date) received one share of Broadridge common stock with a par value $0.01 per share, for every four shares of ADP common stock held by them on the record date and cash for any fractional shares of Broadridge common stock. We have classified the results of operations of the spun off business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, we recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $1,125.2 million for the non cash reduction in net assets of the Brokerage Services Group business related to the spin off, offset by an increase to retained earnings of $690.0 million related to the cash dividend received from Broadridge as part of the spin off. In February 2007, we notified holders of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes that we would redeem all the notes that were outstanding as of the end of the business day on March 19, 2007 (the redemption date). Prior to the redemption date, notes with a face value of approximately $39 million were converted into approximately 1 million shares of the Companys common stock. We subsequently redeemed the remaining 352 notes outstanding as of the redemption date at a redemption price of $775 for each note, representing the accrued value of each note at the time of the redemption. Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,298.0 million in fiscal 2007, as compared to $1,812.5 million in fiscal 2006 as a result of a decrease in the operating activities of discontinued operations of $186.1 million, as well as an increase of $247.2 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $116.2 million in other assets. The increase in accounts receivable was related to our increased revenues and the timing of collections. The increase in other assets was largely due to a $17.4 million increase in our pension plan cash contributions and a $62.3 million increase in other current assets due to the timing of certain payments for prepaid insurance and software maintenance contracts in fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006. Cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal 2007 totaled $430.8 million, as compared to $452.2 million in fiscal 2006. The fluctuation between periods was due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of businesses included in discontinued operations, net of cash divested, of $885.2 million, which was due to the receipt of $896.2 million related to the sale of the Claims Services business and $6.2 million related to the sale of Brokerage Services financial print business in fiscal 2006, offset by $13.2 million received in fiscal 2007 representing a purchase price adjustment relating to the fiscal 2006 sale of the Claims Services business and $4.0 million received from the sale of Sandy Corporation in fiscal 2007. This net decrease was offset by the receipt of the $690.0 million cash dividend from Broadridge, which was offset by $29.9 million of cash retained by Broadridge, and the proceeds of $38.6 million received on the sale of a minority investment in fiscal 2007. The cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal 2007 also increased $34.8 million for cash paid for intangible assets relating to software license fees and increased $107.8 million in cash paid for acquisitions as a result of the eleven businesses acquired in fiscal 2007. These increases were offset by a decrease of $86.0 million in cash paid for capital expenditures due to the completion of the consolidation of the data center facilities in fiscal 2006. Cash flows used in financing in fiscal 2007 totaled $1,884.4 million, as compared to $1,348.8 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in cash used in financing activities was due to increased repurchases of common stock of $600.5 million and an increase in dividends paid of $67.4 million, resulting from the increase in the amount of dividends per common share in fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, offset by the reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to the repurchase of common stock. We purchased 40.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $47.74 in fiscal 31 2007, as compared to 29.6 million shares in fiscal 2006. As of June 30, 2007, we had remaining Board of Directors authorization to purchase up to 43.8 million additional shares. These increases were offset, in part, by an increase in proceeds received from the stock purchase plan and exercises of stock options of $126.2 million due to higher levels of stock option exercises in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. In June 2007, we entered into a $1.75 billion, 364 day credit agreement with a group of lenders. The 364 day facility replaced the Companys prior $1.75 billion 364 day facility. We also have a $1.5 billion credit facility and a $2.25 billion credit facility that mature in June 2010 and June 2011, respectively. The five year facilities contain accordion features under which the aggregate commitments can each be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to the borrowings is tied to LIBOR or prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. We are also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and to provide funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. There were no borrowings through June 30, 2007 under the credit agreements. We maintain a U.S. short term commercial paper program providing for the issuance of up to $5.5 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper at the Companys discretion. Our commercial paper program is rated A 1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime 1 by Moodys. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At June 30, 2007 and 2006, there was no commercial paper outstanding. In fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Companys average borrowings were $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% and 4.1%, respectively. The weighted average maturity of the Companys commercial paper was less than two days in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Our U.S. and Canadian short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. At June 30, 2007 and 2006, there were no outstanding obligations under repurchase agreements. In fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Company had average outstanding balances under repurchase agreements of $141.6 million and $165.7 million, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.4% and 3.5%, respectively. Capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2007 were $169.7 million, as compared to $252.8 million in fiscal 2006 and $160.3 million in fiscal 2005. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 related to data center and other facility improvements to support our operations. The decrease in capital expenditures from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily related to lower capital expenditures relating to the consolidation of the data centers, which was completed in fiscal 2006. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 to be approximately $200 million. 32 The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2007: (In millions) Payments due by period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations 1 year years years 5 years Total Debt Obligations (1) $ 0.2 $ 16.5 $ $ 27.0 $ 43.7 Operating Lease and Software License Obligations (2) 227.6 299.2 72.3 51.1 650.2 Purchase Obligations (3) 87.7 99.4 44.7 231.8 Other long term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets: Compensation and Benefits (4) 51.1 85.4 54.5 69.6 260.6 Total $366.6 $ 500.5 $ 171.5 $147.7 $ 1,186.3 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters. (2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment and other assets. (4) Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2007, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2008, total $18,673.0 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $18,489.2 million of cash and marketable securities recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2007 that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations. The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, ADP Indemnity, Inc., provides workers compensation and employer liability insurance coverage for our PEO worksite employees. We have secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss reinsurance from third party carriers that cap losses that reach a certain level in each policy year. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO business. In fiscal 2007 and 2006, we received premiums of $51.4 million and $46.5 million, respectively, and paid claims of $27.4 million and $21.9 million, respectively. At June 30, 2007, our cash and marketable securities included balances totaling approximately $131.8 million to cover the actuarially estimated cost of workers compensation claims for the policy years that the PEO worksite employees were covered by ADP Indemnity, Inc. 33 In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our products and services. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities, and long term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees). In order to provide more cost effective liquidity and maximize our interest income, we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short term financing arrangements to satisfy our short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. In these instances, a portion of this portfolio is considered and reported within the corporate investment balances in order to reflect the pure client funds assets and related obligations. Interest income on the corporate investment portion of the portfolio is reported in other income, net on our Statements of Consolidated Earnings. Our corporate investments are invested in cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment grade securities. These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short term and long term marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities. Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals, while also seeking to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment grade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at time of purchase. A significant portion of the client funds assets are invested in U.S. government agency securities. We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating for fixed income securities is BBB and for asset backed and mortgage backed securities is AAA. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for a BBB rated security is 5 years, for a single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years. Commercial paper must be rated A1/P1 and, for time deposits, banks must have a Financial Strength Rating of C or better. 34 Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, 2007 2006 2005 Average investment balances at cost: Corporate investments $ 3,556.8 $ 3,487.8 $ 3,065.8 Funds held for clients 14,682.9 13,566.2 12,263.9 Total $ 18,239.7 $ 17,054.0 $ 15,329.7 Average interest rates earned exclusive of realized gains/ (losses) on: Corporate investments 4.6 % 4.0 % 3.0 % Funds held for clients 4.5 % 4.1 % 3.4 % Total 4.5 % 4.0 % 3.3 % Realized gains on available for sale securities $ 20.8 $ 13.3 $ 10.7 Realized losses on available for sale securities (12.5 ) (17.9 ) (39.2 ) Net realized gains/(losses) $ 8.3 $ (4.6 ) $ (28.5 ) As of June 30: Net unrealized pre tax (losses) gains on available for sale securities $ (184.9 ) $ (312.9 ) $ 32.9 Total available for sale securities at fair value $ 13,369.4 $ 13,612.8 $ 13,001.5 In fiscal 2007, approximately 25% of our overall investment portfolio was invested in cash and cash equivalents and, therefore, is impacted by changes in short term interest rates. The other 75% of our investment portfolio was invested in fixed income securities, with varying maturities of 10 years or less, which were also subject to interest rate risk including reinvestment risk. Factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short term and long term investments. This mix varies and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. A hypothetical change in both short term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the Fed Funds rates) and intermediate term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated fiscal 2008 average investment balances and any related borrowings would result in approximately an $11 million impact to earnings before income taxes over a twelve month period. A hypothetical change in only short term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated fiscal 2008 average short term investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a $7 million impact to earnings before income taxes over a twelve month period. The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. The Company limits credit risk by investing in AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors, and for Canadian securities, Dominion Bond Rating Service. At June 30, 2007, approximately 95% of our available for sale securities held an AAA or AA rating. In addition, we also limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than US and Canadian government or government agency securities. 35 The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. We did not enter into any derivative financial instruments in fiscal 2007, nor were there any derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2007. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In March 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified EITF Issue No. 06 11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share Based Payment Awards. EITF 06 11 requires companies to recognize the income tax benefit realized from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and paid to employees for non vested equity classified employee share based payment awards as an increase to additional paid in capital. EITF 06 11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2007. We do not expect EITF 06 11 will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. This statement provides companies with an option to measure selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have, if any, on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In September 2006, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires registrants to use a combination of two approaches to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors, the rollover approach, which quantifies an error based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement, and the iron curtain approach, which quantifies an error based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year. SAB 108 permits companies to adjust for the cumulative effect of immaterial errors relating to prior years in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal year, with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We have adopted SAB 108 in fiscal 2007. The adoption of SAB 108 resulted in an increase to our opening retained earnings as of July 1, 2006 of approximately $44.3 million, net of tax. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). This statement would require a company to (a) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status, (b) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the year in which the changes occur (reported in comprehensive income). The requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the related disclosure requirements were adopted by the Company at the end of fiscal 2007. 36 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). This statement clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 applies to all tax positions accounted for under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes and defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements. The interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained then no benefits of the position are to be recognized. FIN 48 requires additional annual disclosures and is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 is effective for the Company as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 (i.e., as of July 1, 2007). While we continue to analyze the effect of adopting the provisions of FIN 48, it is currently expected that a cumulative effect adjustment in the range of $15 million to $30 million will be charged to retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to increase the reserve for uncertain tax positions. This estimate is subject to change as we complete our analysis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., Employer Services payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services client related funds. We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties. Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. We also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses. For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation and post contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition. 37 We assess collectibility of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. We do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectibility determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. Goodwill. We review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. When determining fair value, we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long term growth rates, estimated costs, and appropriate discount rates based on the Companys weighted average cost of capital. Our estimates of long term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine long range planning process. We had $2,353.6 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2007. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated earnings. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123R requires the measurement of stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binominal option pricing model. The binomial option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Companys stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. Prior to July 1, 2005, we followed APB No. 25, and related interpretations. Under APB No. 25, no stock based compensation expense was recognized related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan, as all options granted under the stock option program had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and, with respect to the employee stock purchase plan, the discount did not exceed fifteen percent.
