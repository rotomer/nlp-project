ADPs fiscal 2009 results were clearly impacted by the severe economic conditions, including rising unemployment, declining automobile sales, low interest rates, and volatile financial markets. However, we are meeting the challenge of this recessionary environment by continuing to focus on our five point strategy and taking the actions necessary for the Company to be stronger and even better positioned for when the economy improves. The headwinds from the global recession impacted our growth during fiscal 2009. Consolidated revenues from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 grew 1%, to $8,867.1 million, as compared to $8,776.5 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 (fiscal 2008) due to increases in revenues in Employer Services of 4%, or $225.3 million, to $6,587.7 million, and PEO Services of 12%, or $125.3 million, to $1,185.8 million. Such increases were partially offset by fluctuations in foreign currency rates, which reduced our revenue by $188.0 million, or 2%, a decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients of $74.7 million and a decrease in Dealer Services revenue of 3%, or $42.8 million. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and net earnings from continuing operations increased 5% and 14%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20%, to $2.63 in fiscal 2009, from $2.20 per share in fiscal 2008, on fewer weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Employer Services revenues increased 4% and PEO Services revenues increased 12% in fiscal 2009. Employer Services and PEO Services new business sales, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, declined 15% worldwide, to approximately $982.3 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, average client funds balances declined 3% due to lower bonuses, lower wage growth, and a decline in pays per control. Our key business metrics for Employer Services showed year over year declines in fiscal 2009. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same store sales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 137,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, decreased 2.5% in fiscal 2009. Client retention decreased 1.2 percentage points worldwide over last years record level. PEO Services revenues grew 12% in fiscal 2009 due to a 10% increase in the average number of worksite employees. Dealer Services revenues, which were negatively impacted by the difficulties facing the automotive industry, decreased 3% in fiscal 2009 due to dealership consolidations and closings, lower transactional revenue and dealerships reducing services in order to cut their discretionary expenses. We have a strong focus on strengthening our business model, which has approximately 90% recurring revenues, excellent margins from the ability to generate consistent, strong cash flows, strong client retention and low capital expenditure requirements. We believe we have right sized the organization for the expected near term lower revenue growth. Additionally, ADP has continued to return excess cash to our shareholders. We have bought back approximately 20% of the Companys common stock that was outstanding at the beginning of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. We have also raised the dividend payout for 34 consecutive years while still maintaining our AAA credit rating. We are especially pleased with the performance of our investment portfolio and the investment choices we made throughout the year. Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset backed securities with underlying collateral of sub prime mortgages, alternative A mortgages, sub prime auto loans or home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non investment grade fixed income securities. We own senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, rate reduction, auto loan and other asset backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral. All collateral on asset backed securities is performing as expected. In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). We do not own subordinated debt, preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies. We do own AAA rated mortgage backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages. These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15 year and 30 year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. In addition, our AAA credit rating has helped us maintain uninterrupted access to the commercial paper market. 14 Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2009, with cash and marketable securities of $2,388.5 million. The cash and marketable securities balance included $730.0 million of cash related to the outstanding commercial paper borrowing as of June 30, 2009, which was repaid on July 1, 2009. This borrowing was a normal part of our client funds extended investment strategy. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,562.6 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to $1,772.2 million in fiscal 2008. This decrease in cash flows from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 was due to the timing of collections of accounts receivable and the timing of funding of our employee benefits program, partially offset by a decrease in pension plan contributions as compared to the prior year.

Such increases were partially offset by fluctuations in foreign currency rates, which reduced our revenue by $188.0 million, or 2%, a decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients of $74.7 million and a decrease in Dealer Services of 3%, or $42.8 million. The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 4.0% in fiscal 2009 as compared to 4.4% in fiscal 2008, and a decrease in our average client funds balances for fiscal 2009 of 3.1%, to $15.2 billion. Total Expenses Our consolidated expenses decreased 1%, to $7,070.4 million in fiscal 2009, from $7,131.0 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease in our consolidated expenses was due to a decrease of $161.3 million, or 2%, related to foreign currency fluctuations and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $172.8 million, which was attributable to lower selling expenses and cost saving initiatives that commenced in fiscal 2008 and continued in fiscal 2009. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $186.3 million attributable to the increase in our revenues discussed above. In addition, there was an increase in pass through costs in our PEO business including those costs associated with providing benefits coverage for worksite employees of $102.7 million and costs associated with workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees of $16.8 million. Our total costs of revenues increased $159.4 million, to $4,839.5 million in fiscal 2009, from $4,680.1 million in fiscal 2008, due to an increase in our operating expenses of $186.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in our systems development and programming costs of $26.2 million. Operating expenses increased $186.3 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO Services, which have pass through costs including those costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees that are re billable. These pass through costs were $874.8 million in fiscal 2009, which included costs for benefits coverage of $724.3 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $150.5 million. These costs were $755.3 million in fiscal 2008, which included costs for benefits coverage of $621.6 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $133.7 million. The increase in operating expenses is also due to higher expenses in Employer Services of $64.5 million related to increased service costs for investment in client facing resources. Such increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of approximately $84.0 million due to foreign currency fluctuations. Systems development and programming expenses decreased $26.2 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to decreases related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $15.8 million, a decrease in stock based compensation expenses of $6.5 million and a decrease in programming expenses related to our systems of $3.9 million. The decrease in programming expenses was a result of a decrease in the average cost per associate as a larger percentage of our associates are located in off shore and smart shore locations. In addition, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $0.7 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to decreases related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $5.4 million, which were partially offset by increased amortization expenses of $4.7 million resulting from the intangible assets acquired with new businesses and the purchases of software and software licenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $172.8 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, which was attributable to decreases related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of $55.7 million, a decrease in selling expenses related to a decline in our new client sales of $45.6 million and a reversal of $23.3 million in expenses due to a favorable ruling related to an international business capital tax. In addition, the decrease is attributable to our cost saving initiatives that commenced in fiscal 2008 and continued in fiscal 2009, which included a reduction in payroll and payroll related expenses of $32.3 million and a decrease in stock based compensation expenses of $16.3 million. Such decreases were partially offset by an increase in restructuring charges, primarily related to severance, of $67.6 million and an increase in the provision for our allowance for doubtful accounts of $15.5 million due to losses related to our notes receivable from automotive, heavy truck and powersports dealers. 16 Interest expense decreased $47.2 million in fiscal 2009 as a result of a decrease of $40.6 million related to our short term commercial paper program and a decrease of $6.6 million related to our reverse repurchase program. In the aggregate, interest expense decreased by approximately $68.4 million related to decreases in interest rates and increased approximately $21.2 million related to increases in borrowings. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, the Companys average borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 1.0% and 4.2%, respectively. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, the Companys average borrowings under the reverse repurchase program were approximately $425.9 million and $360.4 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively. Other Income, net Years ended June 30, 2009 2008 $ Change (Dollars in millions) Interest income on corporate funds $ (134.2 ) $ (149.5 ) $ (15.3 ) Gain on sale of building (2.2 ) (16.0 ) (13.8 ) Realized gains on available for sale securities (11.4 ) (10.1 ) 1.3 Realized losses on available for sale securities 23.8 11.4 (12.4 ) Realized loss on investment in Reserve Fund 18.3 (18.3 ) Other, net (2.3 ) (2.3 ) Other income, net $ (108.0 ) $ (166.5 ) $ (58.5 ) Other income, net, decreased $58.5 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to a loss of $18.3 million related to investment in the Primary Fund of the Reserve Fund (the Reserve Fund), a decrease in interest income on corporate funds of $15.3 million, a reduction in income of $13.8 million from the sale of buildings and an increase in net realized losses on available for sale securities of $11.1 million. In the aggregate, interest income on corporate funds decreased by approximately $30.9 million related to decreases in interest rates and increased approximately $15.6 million related to increases in average daily balances. Average interest rates decreased from 4.4% in fiscal 2008 to 3.6% in fiscal 2009. Average daily balances increased from $3.4 billion in fiscal 2008 to $3.7 billion in fiscal 2009. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 5%, to $1,904.7 million in fiscal 2009, from $1,812.0 million in fiscal 2008, due to the increase in revenues and the decrease in expenses discussed above. Overall margin increased 80 basis points in fiscal 2009. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was 30.3%, as compared to 35.9% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $120.0 million related to favorable tax settlements, including an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit settlement and the settlement of a state tax matter. These settlements decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 6.3 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Lastly, during fiscal 2008, there was a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $12.4 million related to the settlement of a state tax matter. This decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 0.7 percentage points in fiscal 2008. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Net earnings from continuing operations increased 14%, to $1,328.2 million, in fiscal 2009, from $1,161.7 million in fiscal 2008, and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20%, to $2.63 in fiscal 2009. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 reflects the increased revenues, lower expenses and lower effective tax rate as described above. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer weighted average diluted shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2009 and 32.9 million shares in fiscal 2008. 17 Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change Total revenues $ 8,776.5 $ 7,800.0 $ 976.5 13 % Costs of revenues: Operating expenses 3,915.7 3,392.3 523.4 15 % Systems development and programming costs 525.9 486.1 39.8 8 % Depreciation and amortization 238.5 208.9 29.6 14 % Total costs of revenues 4,680.1 4,087.3 592.8 15 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,370.4 2,206.2 164.2 7 % Interest expense 80.5 94.9 (14.4 ) (15 )% Total expenses 7,131.0 6,388.4 742.6 12 % Other income, net 166.5 211.9 (45.4 ) (21 )% Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,812.0 $ 1,623.5 $ 188.5 12 % Margin 20.6 % 20.8 % Provision for income taxes $ 650.3 $ 602.3 $ 48.0 8 % Effective tax rate 35.9 % 37.1 % Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,161.7 $ 1,021.2 $ 140.5 14 % Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.20 $ 1.83 $ 0.37 20 % Total Revenues Our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008 grew 13%, to $8,776.5 million, due to increases in revenues in Employer Services of 9%, or $546.1 million, to $6,362.4 million, PEO Services of 20%, or $175.7 million, to $1,060.5 million, and Dealer Services of 9%, or $110.8 million, to $1,391.4 million. Our consolidated internal revenue growth, which represents revenue growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was 11% in fiscal 2008. Revenue growth was favorably impacted by $167.8 million, or 2%, due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008 include interest on funds held for clients of $684.5 million as compared to $653.6 million in the year ended June 30, 2007 (fiscal 2007). The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the increase of 6.6% in our average client funds balances to $15.7 billion, offset by the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 4.4% in fiscal 2008 as compared to 4.5% in fiscal 2007. Total Expenses Our consolidated expenses increased $742.6 million, to $7,131.0 million in fiscal 2008, from $6,388.4 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in our consolidated expenses is due to the increase in our revenues, higher pass through costs associated with our PEO business, an increase in our salesforce and implementation personnel, and higher expenses associated with Employer Services new business sales and implementation. In addition, consolidated expenses increased $142.1 million, or 2%, in fiscal 2008 due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 18 Our total costs of revenues increased $592.8 million, to $4,680.1 million in fiscal 2008, from $4,087.3 million in fiscal 2007, due to increases in our operating expenses. Operating expenses increased $523.4 million, or 15%, in fiscal 2008 due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO services, which has pass through costs including those costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees that are re billable. These costs were $755.3 million in fiscal 2008, which included costs for benefits coverage of $621.6 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $133.7 million. These costs were $633.7 million in fiscal 2007, which included costs for benefits coverage of $505.5 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $128.2 million. The increase in operating expenses is also due to an increase of approximately $131.7 million relating to compensation expenses associated with implementation and service personnel in Employer Services. Operating expenses also increased approximately $28.0 million due to the operating costs of acquired businesses and approximately $73.6 million due to foreign currency fluctuations. Systems development and programming costs increased $39.8 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to an increase in expenses of $5.1 million for acquired businesses. Systems development and programming expenses also increased approximately $15.0 million due to foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, depreciation and amortization expenses increased $29.6 million, or 14%, in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to increased amortization expenses of $10.2 million resulting from the intangible assets acquired with new businesses and the purchases of software and software licenses in fiscal 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $164.2 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, which was attributable to the increase in salesforce personnel to support our new domestic business sales in Employer Services. This increase in salesforce personnel resulted in an increase of approximately $32.0 million of expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased approximately $34.5 million due to the selling, general and administrative costs of acquired businesses and approximately $48.8 million due to foreign currency fluctuations. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $8.0 million. Interest expense decreased $14.4 million in fiscal 2008 as a result of lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates on our short term commercial paper program. In fiscal 2008 and 2007, the Companys average borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 4.2% and 5.3%, respectively. Other Income, net Years ended June 30, 2008 2007 $ Change (Dollars in millions) Interest income on corporate funds $ (149.5 ) $ (165.0 ) $ (15.5 ) Gain on sale of building (16.0 ) 16.0 Gain on sale of investment (38.6 ) (38.6 ) Realized gains on available for sale securities (10.1 ) (20.8 ) (10.7 ) Realized losses on available for sale securities 11.4 12.5 1.1 Other, net (2.3 ) 2.3 Other income, net $ (166.5 ) $ (211.9 ) $ (45.4 ) Other income, net, decreased $45.4 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of a building in fiscal 2008 of $16.0 million and a gain on the sale of a minority investment during fiscal 2007 of $38.6 million. Other income, net, also decreased $9.6 million due to net realized losses on available for sale securities of $1.3 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to net realized gains on available for sale securities of $8.3 million in fiscal 2007. Lastly, interest income on corporate funds decreased $15.5 million as a result of lower average daily balances and lower interest rates. Average daily balances declined from $3.6 billion in fiscal 2007 to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2008 due to the use of corporate funds for repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2008. The average interest rate earned on our corporate funds decreased from 4.6% in fiscal 2007 to 4.4% in fiscal 2008. 19 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $188.5 million, or 12%, from $1,623.5 million in fiscal 2007 to $1,812.0 million in fiscal 2008 due to the increase in revenues and corresponding expenses discussed above. Overall margin decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2008. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 was 35.9%, as compared to 37.1% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to a favorable mix in income among state tax jurisdictions, as well as tax rate decreases in certain foreign tax jurisdictions. Additionally, during fiscal 2008, there was a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $12.4 million related to the settlement of a state tax matter. This decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 0.7 percentage points in fiscal 2008. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes relating to the recording of the interest liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits as required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48). This increased the effective tax rate by approximately 0.6 percentage points in fiscal 2008. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Net earnings from continuing operations increased 14%, to $1,161.7 million, for fiscal 2008, from $1,021.2 million in fiscal 2007, and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20%, to $2.20, in fiscal 2008. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2008 reflects the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate. These increases were offset by the decline in other income, net, of $45.4 million in fiscal 2008. This decrease was a result of lower transactional gains reported in fiscal 2008 of $22.6 million, lower net realized gains/losses on available for sale securities of $9.6 million and lower interest income on corporate funds of $15.5 million. The decrease in transactional gains in fiscal 2008 of $22.6 million was a result of a gain on the sale of a building of $16.0 million during fiscal 2008 and a gain on the sale of a minority investment of $38.6 million during fiscal 2007. The decrease in interest income on corporate funds was a result of lower average daily balances and lower interest rates. Average daily balances declined from $3.6 billion in fiscal 2007 to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2008 due to the use of corporate funds for repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2008. The average interest rate earned on our corporate funds decreased from 4.6% in fiscal 2007 to 4.4% in fiscal 2008. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2008 reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer weighted average diluted shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 32.9 million shares in fiscal 2008 and 40.2 million shares in fiscal 2007.

This adjustment is made for management purposes so that the reportable segments revenues are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This adjustment is a reconciling item to revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of this adjustment in consolidation. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are charged to the reportable segments based on managements responsibility for the applicable costs. The primary components of the Other segment are miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, non recurring gains and losses and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock based compensation expense. In addition, the reconciling items include an adjustment for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. This allocation is made for management reasons so that the reportable segments results are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. This allocation is a reconciling item to our reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of this adjustment in consolidation. Finally, the reportable segments results include a cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. This charge is a reconciling item to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of this charge in consolidation. 21 Employer Services Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenues Employer Services revenues increased $225.3 million, or 4%, to $6,587.7 million in fiscal 2009. Revenues from our payroll and payroll tax filing business were flat for fiscal 2009. Our payroll and payroll tax filing revenues were adversely impacted in fiscal 2009 due to the reduced number of payrolls processed, a decline in pays per control and a reduction in the average daily balances held, but these declines were offset by pricing increases. Our worldwide client retention decreased by 1.2 percentage points during fiscal 2009. Lost business due to clients pricing sensitivity and clients going out of business increased during fiscal 2009 as a result of economic pressures. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same store sales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 137,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, decreased 2.5% in fiscal 2009. We credit Employer Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the Employer Services segment decreased $25.0 million, or 3.4% in fiscal 2009, as a result of a decrease in average daily balances from $15.5 billion for fiscal 2008 to $15.0 billion for fiscal 2009, related to lower bonuses, lower wage growth, and a decline in pays per control. The impact of pricing increases was an increase of approximately 2% to our revenue for fiscal 2009. Revenues from our beyond payroll services increased 8% in fiscal 2009 due to an increase in our Time and Labor Management and HR Benefits services revenues, due to an increase in the number of clients utilizing these services, partially offset by a decline in our Retirement Services revenues due to a decrease in the market value of the assets under management. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Employer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $160.0 million, or 10%, to $1,775.4 million in fiscal 2009. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2009 grew at a faster rate than revenues due to a decrease of $57.7 million related to management incentive compensation expenses, slower growth in selling expenses of $36.2 million as compared to revenues due to a decline in our new client sales and our cost saving initiatives that commenced in fiscal 2008 and continued in fiscal 2009, including headcount reductions and curtailment of non essential travel and entertainment expenses. These decreases in expenses were offset, in part, by higher expenses of $64.5 million related to increased service costs for investment in client facing resources. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenues Employer Services revenues increased $546.1 million, or 9%, to $6,362.4 million in fiscal 2008 due to new business started in the period, an increase in the number of employees on our clients payrolls, the impact of price increases, which contributed approximately 2% to our revenue growth, and an increase in average client funds balances, which increased interest revenues. Internal revenue growth, which represents revenue growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was approximately 8% for fiscal 2008. Revenue from our payroll and payroll tax filing business grew 7%. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same store sales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 141,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, increased 1.3% in fiscal 2008. Our worldwide client retention increased 0.2 percentage points in fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Revenues from our beyond payroll services increased 16% in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in our Time and Labor Management services revenues of 17% and due to the impact of business acquisitions. The increase in revenues related to our Time and Labor Management services was due to an increase in the number of clients utilizing these services. We credit Employer Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the Employer Services segment increased $41.4 million in fiscal 2008, which accounted for 1% growth in Employer Services revenues. This increase was due to the increase in the average client funds balances as a result of new business started in the period, growth in our existing client base and growth in wages. The average client funds balances were $15.5 billion in fiscal 2008 and $14.6 billion in fiscal 2007, representing an increase of 6.4%. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Employer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $197.7 million, or 14%, to $1,615.4 million in fiscal 2008. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2008 grew at a faster rate than revenues due to the improvement in margins for our services resulting from the leveraging of our expense structure with increased revenues. This was offset, in part, by higher compensation expenses of $131.7 million for implementation and service personnel, as well as higher selling expenses of $38.0 million attributable to the increase in salesforce personnel in Employer Services. Lastly, our expenses increased by approximately $42.2 million as a result of acquisitions of businesses in Employer Services. 22 PEO Services Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenues PEO Services revenues increased $125.3 million, or 12%, to $1,185.8 million in fiscal 2009 due to a 10% increase in the average number of worksite employees. The increase in the average number of worksite employees was due to new client sales. Revenues associated with benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees that were billed to our clients increased $119.5 million due to the increase in the average number of worksite employees, as well as increases in health care costs. Administrative revenues, which represent the fees for our services and are billed based upon a percentage of wages related to worksite employees, increased $15.3 million, or 7%, due to the increase in the number of average worksite employees. We credit PEO Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, PEO Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the PEO Services segment increased $1.5 million in fiscal 2009 due to the increase in the average client funds balances as a result of increased PEO Services new business and growth in our existing client base. The average client funds balances were $0.2 billion in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes PEO Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $13.9 million, or 13%, to $118.7 million in fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues described above, net of the related cost of providing benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees, which are included in costs of revenues. In fiscal 2009, there was an increase in costs associated with our PEO business related to costs associated with providing benefits coverage for worksite employees of $102.7 million and costs associated with workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees of $16.8 million. In addition, there was an increase in expenses related to new business sales of $2.0 million in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenues PEO Services revenues increased $175.7 million, or 20%, to $1,060.5 million in fiscal 2008 due to an 18% increase in the average number of worksite employees. The increase in the average number of worksite employees was due to new client sales and the net increase in the number of worksite employees at existing clients. Additionally, benefits related revenues, which are billed to our clients and have an equal amount of cost in operating expenses, increased $115.8 million, or 23%, due to the increase in the average number of worksite employees, as well as increases in health care costs. Administrative revenues, which represent the fees for our services that are billed based upon a percentage of wages related to worksite employees, increased $29.4 million, or 17%, due to the increase in the number of average worksite employees and price increases. We credit PEO Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, PEO Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the PEO Services segment increased $1.7 million in fiscal 2008 due to the increase in the average client funds balances as a result of increased PEO Services new business and growth in our existing client base. The average client funds balances were $0.2 billion in fiscal 2008 and $0.1 billion in fiscal 2007. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes PEO Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $24.4 million, or 30%, to $104.8 million in fiscal 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues described above, net of the related cost of providing benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees, which are included in costs of revenues. This increase was partially offset by an increase in our operating costs and selling expenses. In fiscal 2008, our cost of providing benefits to worksite employees increased $116.1 million over fiscal 2007. Our expenses associated with new business sales increased $12.2 million as a result of growth in our salesforce and an increase in sales over fiscal 2007. In addition, the costs of providing our services increased $14.0 million in fiscal 2008. 23 Dealer Services Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenues Dealer Services revenues decreased $42.8 million, or 3%, to $1,348.6 million in fiscal 2009. Revenues for our Dealer Services business would have declined approximately 4% for fiscal 2009 without the impact of acquisitions. The decrease in revenues was due to client losses and cancellation of services resulting from the consolidation and closing of dealerships and continued pressure on dealerships to reduce costs, all of which resulted in a decrease to revenues of $72.9 million for fiscal 2009. In addition, revenues decreased $23.9 million due to lower Credit Check, Laser Printing, and Computerized Vehicle Registration (CVR) transaction volume and $9.5 million due to a decrease in revenues from consulting services and forms and supplies. These decreases in revenues were offset by a $67.8 million increase in revenues from new clients and growth in our key products during fiscal 2009. The growth in our key products was driven by increased users for Application Service Provider (ASP) managed services, growth in our Customer Relationship Management applications and new network and hosted IP telephony installations. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Dealer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $9.7 million, or 4%, to $224.1 million in fiscal 2009 due to the decrease of $42.8 million in revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses of $33.1 million. The decrease in expenses was due to lower selling expenses of $11.4 million related to a decline in new client sales and a decrease of $13.2 million in expenses due to certain cost saving initiatives, including headcount reductions and curtailment of non essential travel and entertainment expenses, and a decrease of $7.1 million related to management incentive compensation expenses. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenues Dealer Services revenues increased $110.8 million, or 9%, to $1,391.4 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in revenues in fiscal 2008 was driven by both internal revenue growth and by acquisitions. Internal revenue growth, which represents the revenue growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was approximately 6% in fiscal 2008. Revenues increased for our dealer business systems in North America by $59.1 million, to $1,012.9 million in fiscal 2008 due to growth in our key products. The growth in our key products was driven by the increased users for ASP managed services, growth in our Digital Marketing strategic initiatives, increased Credit Check and CVR transaction volume, and new network and hosted IP telephony installations. In addition, revenues increased $39.9 million due to business acquisitions in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2007 as well as in fiscal 2008. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Dealer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $26.6 million, or 13%, to $233.8 million in fiscal 2008 due to the increase in revenues of our dealer business systems and contributions from recent acquisitions. These increases were offset by an increase in operating expenses as a result of an increase in headcount to support new business sales and the timing of installations during the year. Lastly, our expenses increased by approximately $37.0 million as a result of acquisitions of businesses during fiscal 2008. Other The primary components of the Other segment are miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, non recurring gains and losses and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock based compensation expense. Stock based compensation expense was $96.0 million, $123.6 million and $130.5 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Lastly, a gain on the sale of a building of $2.2 million in fiscal 2009 and a gain on sale of a building of $16.0 million in fiscal 2008 are included in Other. 24 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The global financial markets experienced much volatility during fiscal 2009. Despite this volatility in the financial markets, we believe that our liquidity position remains strong. We expect our existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations. However, it is not possible to predict the impact of future events on our financial results or liquidity. At June 30, 2009, cash and marketable securities were $2,388.5 million, stockholders equity was $5,322.6 million and the ratio of long term debt to equity was 0.8%. Working capital before funds held for clients and client funds obligations was $1,521.0 million, as compared to $1,343.1 million at June 30, 2008. This increase is due to cash generated from operations, partially offset by the use of cash to repurchase common stock and the use of cash for dividend payments. Our principal sources of liquidity for operations are derived from cash generated through operations and through corporate cash and marketable securities on hand. We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during fiscal 2009, and we held approximately $2.3 billion of cash, which included $730.0 million of cash related to the outstanding commercial paper borrowing as of June 30, 2009, which was repaid on July 1, 2009, and approximately $0.1 billion of marketable securities at June 30, 2009. The commercial paper borrowing is a normal part of our client funds extended investment strategy. We also have the ability to generate cash through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short term repurchase agreements to meet short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $1,562.6 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to $1,772.2 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease in net cash flows provided by operating activities was due to the timing of funding of our employee benefits program, which reduced cash flows from operating activities by $45.0 million. In addition, there was an increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of cash collections, which reduced our cash flows from operating activities by $183.9 million. These decreases in net cash flows provided by operating activities were partially offset by the timing of pension plan contributions as compared to the prior year, which increased cash flows from operating activities by $49.3 million. Net cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2009 totaled $644.1 million, as compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities of $2,613.9 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities of $3,258.0 million was due to the timing of receipts and payments of our cash held to satisfy client funds obligations, which resulted in the use of cash of $4,851.3 million during fiscal 2009. In addition, we received proceeds of $112.4 million from the sale of businesses during fiscal 2008. Lastly, during fiscal 2009, there was a reclassification from cash and cash equivalents to short term marketable securities of $211.1 million related to the Reserve Fund discussed below. The proceeds received related to the Reserve Fund have been included in proceeds from the sales and maturities of corporate and client funds marketable securities. These decreases in cash flows were partially offset by a reduction in cash paid for acquisitions of $30.3 million, cash received from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $25.7 million and the timing of purchases of and proceeds from the sales or maturities of marketable securities that resulted in an increase in cash flows of $1,850.5 million. Net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal 2009 totaled $468.4 million as compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of $5,270.7 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in net cash flows from financing activities of $5,739.1 million was due to the net change in the client funds obligations of $4,365.5 million as a result of timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds obligations, proceeds received from the issuance of commercial paper of $730.0 million and a decrease in the repurchases of common stock of $924.4 million. We purchased 13.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $39.72 during fiscal 2009 as compared to purchases of 32.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $44.44 during fiscal 2008. Such increases in cash flows of financing activities were partially offset by an increase in dividends paid of $80.5 million and a decrease in the proceeds from stock purchase plan and exercises of stock options of $157.0 million. Our U.S. short term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $6.0 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program is rated A 1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime 1 by Moodys. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At June 30, 2009, we had $730.0 million in commercial paper outstanding. Such amount was repaid on July 1, 2009. At June 30, 2008, there was no commercial paper outstanding. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, our average borrowings were $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.0% and 4.2%, respectively. The weighted average maturity of our commercial paper was less than two days in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Throughout fiscal 2009, we had full access to our U.S. short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. 25 Our U.S. and Canadian short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. At June 30, 2009, there were no outstanding obligations under reverse repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2008, we had an $11.8 million obligation outstanding related to reverse repurchase agreements that matured on July 2, 2008 and was repaid. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $425.9 million and $360.4 million, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. In June 2009, we entered into a $2.25 billion, 364 day credit agreement with a group of lenders. The 364 day facility replaced our prior $2.25 billion 364 day facility. In addition, we also have a $1.5 billion credit facility and a $2.25 billion credit facility that mature in June 2010 and June 2011, respectively. The credit facilities maturing in June 2010 and June 2011 are five year facilities that contain accordion features under which the aggregate commitments can each be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the federal funds effective rate or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by us to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. We are also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through June 30, 2009 under the credit agreements. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $6.0 billion available to us under the credit agreements. Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset backed securities with underlying collateral of sub prime mortgages, alternative A mortgages, sub prime auto loans or home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non investment grade fixed income securities. We own senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, rate reduction, auto loan and other asset backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral. All collateral on asset backed securities is performing as expected. In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). We do not own subordinated debt, preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies. We do own AAA rated mortgage backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages. These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15 year and 30 year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. We have an investment in a money market fund called the Reserve Fund. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, the net asset value of the Reserve Fund decreased below $1 per share as a result of the full write off of the Reserve Funds holdings in debt securities issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., which filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15, 2008. The Reserve Fund has suspended redemptions and is in the process of being liquidated. At September 30, 2008, we reclassified $211.1 million of our investment from cash and cash equivalents to short term marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the fact that these assets no longer met the definition of a cash equivalent. Additionally, we have reflected the impact of such reclassification on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for fiscal 2009 as a reclassification from cash equivalents to short term marketable securities. During fiscal 2009, we recorded an $18.3 million loss to other income, net, on the Statement of Consolidated Earnings to recognize our pro rata share of the estimated losses of the Reserve Fund. As of June 30, 2009, we had received approximately $198.5 million in distributions from the Reserve Fund. Subsequent to the distributions received from the Reserve Fund and the charges recorded during fiscal 2009, we have a remaining balance of $3.9 million in short term marketable securities related to the Reserve Fund as of June 30, 2009. 26 During fiscal 2009, the number of automotive dealerships in the United States to which we provide services has continued to decline primarily due to the consolidation of dealerships and dealerships going out of business. In April 2009, Chrysler LLC (Chrysler) filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code to reorganize its business and subsequently emerged from bankruptcy in June 2009. In June 2009, General Motors Corporation (GM) filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code to reorganize its business and subsequently emerged from bankruptcy in July 2009. We expect the total number of GM and Chrysler dealerships in the United States to decline by about 1,800 over the next 12 to 18 months. Given our share of the market, the impact of these dealership closings to our revenues in Dealer Services is expected to be up to $50 million on an annualized basis. At June 30, 2009, our notes receivable and accounts receivable balances on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include gross receivables of $73 million and $35 million, respectively, due from automobile dealerships that sell GM or Chrysler products in the United States. At June 30, 2009, we do not have any significant amounts due to us directly from GM or Chrysler. Capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2009 were $167.7 million, as compared to $186.4 million in fiscal 2008 and $169.7 million in fiscal 2007. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 related to our data center and other facility improvements to support our operations. We expect capital expenditures in the year ended June 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010) to be between $130 million and $150 million. The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2009: (In millions) Payments due by period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations 1 year years years 5 years Unknown Total Debt Obligations (1) $ 2.8 $ 13.3 $ 13.3 $ 16.1 $ $ 45.5 Operating Lease and Software License Obligations (2) 246.1 386.3 148.6 39.7 820.7 Purchase Obligations (3) 124.8 119.3 30.0 274.1 Obligations related to Unrecognized 92.8 92.8 Tax Benefits (4) Other long term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets: Compensation and Benefits (5) 55.2 108.6 78.1 146.0 11.8 399.7 Acquisition related obligations (6) 8.0 8.0 Total $ 436.9 $ 627.5 $ 270.0 $ 201.8 $ 104.6 $ 1,640.8 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters. The estimated interest payments due by corresponding period above are $1.5 million, $3.0 million, $2.9 million, and $5.8 million, respectively, which have been excluded. (2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment and other assets. (4) We made the determination that net cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months, related to unrecognized tax benefits of $92.8 million at June 30, 2009, are expected to be zero. We are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period beyond the next 12 months in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid. (5) Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. (6) Acquisition related obligations relate to contingent consideration for business acquisitions for which the amount of contingent consideration was determinable at the date of acquisition and therefore included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability. 27 In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2009, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2010, total $15,992.6 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $16,419.2 million of cash and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2009. The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, ADP Indemnity, Inc., provides workers compensation and employer liability insurance coverage for our PEO worksite employees. We have secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss reinsurance from third party carriers that cap losses that reach a certain level in each policy year. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO business. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, the net premium was $60.8 million and $51.4 million, respectively. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, we paid claims of $43.6 million and $38.1 million, respectively. At June 30, 2009, our cash and marketable securities included balances totaling approximately $181.6 million to cover the actuarially estimated cost of workers compensation claims for the policy years that the PEO worksite employees were covered by ADP Indemnity, Inc. In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities, and long term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees). Our corporate investments are invested in cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment grade securities. These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short term and long term fixed income securities are classified as available for sale securities. Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals. Consistent with those goals, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment grade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents. At June 30, 2009, approximately 85% of the available for sale securities categorized as U.S. Treasury and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies were invested in senior, unsecured, non callable debt directly issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short term financing arrangements to satisfy our short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client fund obligations, rather than liquidating previously collected client funds that have already been invested in available for sale securities. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such clients obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the clients funds in advance of the timing of payment of such clients obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client fund assets to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client fund assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available for sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $6 billion commercial paper program (rated A 1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime 1 by Moodys, the highest possible credit rating), our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and available borrowings under our $6 billion committed revolving credit facilities. However, the availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our flexibility to access short term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below. 28 We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate bonds is BBB and for asset backed and commercial mortgage backed securities is AAA. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years. Commercial paper must be rated A1/P1 and, for time deposits, banks must have a Financial Strength Rating of C or better. Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, 2009 2008 2007 Average investment balances at cost: Corporate investments $ 3,744.7 $ 3,387.0 $ 3,556.8 Funds held for clients 15,162.4 15,654.3 14,682.9 Total $ 18,907.1 $ 19,041.3 $ 18,239.7 Average interest rates earned exclusive of realized gains/(losses) on: Corporate investments 3.6 % 4.4 % 4.6 % Funds held for clients 4.0 % 4.4 % 4.5 % Total 3.9 % 4.4 % 4.5 % Realized gains on available for sale securities $ 11.4 $ 10.1 $ 20.8 Realized losses on available for sale securities (23.8 ) (11.4 ) (12.5 ) Net realized (losses)/gains on available for sale securities $ (12.4 ) $ (1.3 ) $ 8.3 As of June 30: Net unrealized pre tax gains/(losses) on available for sale securities $ 436.6 $ 142.1 $ (184.9 ) Total available for sale securities at fair value $ 14,730.2 $ 15,066.4 $ 13,369.4 Our laddering strategy exposes us to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short term and long term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decreased by 50 basis points, from 4.4% for fiscal 2008 to 3.9% for fiscal 2009. A hypothetical change in both short term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a $6 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve month period ending June 30, 2010. A hypothetical change in only short term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short term investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a $3 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve month period ending June 30, 2010. We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment grade securities, primarily AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors, and for Canadian securities, Dominion Bond Rating Service. At June 30, 2009, approximately 83% of our available for sale securities held an AAA or AA rating. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than US and Canadian government or government agency securities. 29 We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2009 or 2008. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In May 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 165, Subsequent Events (SFAS No. 165). SFAS No. 165 establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued including the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements. SFAS No. 165 is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. On June 30, 2009, we adopted SFAS No. 165 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 157 4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That are Not Orderly (FSP FAS 157 4). FSP FAS 157 4 provides additional guidance for determining the fair value of assets and liabilities when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. FSP FAS 157 4 also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate an observed transaction used to determine fair value is not orderly and, therefore, is not indicative of fair value. FSP FAS 157 4 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. On April 1, 2009, we adopted FSP FAS 157 4 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 2 and FAS 124 2, Recognition and Presentation of Other Than Temporary Impairments (FSP FAS 115 2 and FAS 124 2). FSP FAS 115 2 and FAS 124 2 changes the method for determining whether an other than temporary impairment exists for debt securities by requiring a company to assess whether it is probable that it will not be able to recover the cost basis of a security utilizing several factors, including the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, adverse conditions related to a particular security and volatility of a particular security. FSP FAS 115 2 and FAS 124 2 also requires that an other than temporary impairment charge for debt securities be recorded in earnings if it is more likely than not that the entity will sell or be required to sell a debt security before anticipated recovery of the cost basis. In addition, if any portion of a decline in fair value below the cost basis of a security is related to credit losses, such amount should be recorded in earnings. Lastly, FSP FAS 115 2 and FAS 124 2 expands and increases the frequency of existing disclosures about other than temporary impairments for debt and equity securities to all interim and annual periods. FSP FAS 115 2 and FAS 124 2 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. On April 1, 2009, we adopted FSP FAS 115 2 and FAS 124 2 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (FSP FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1). FSP FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1 increases the frequency of certain fair value disclosures from annual to quarterly. Such disclosures include the fair value of all financial instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, as well as the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value. FSP FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1 is effective for interim periods ending after June 15, 2009. On April 1, 2009, we adopted FSP FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP FAS 132(R) 1). FSP FAS 132(R) 1 requires additional disclosures in relation to plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. FSP FAS 132(R) 1 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 with early application permitted. We do not anticipate the adoption of this FSP will have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1). FSP EITF 03 6 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method. FSP EITF 03 6 1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Upon adoption, companies are required to retrospectively adjust earnings per share data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial data) to conform to provisions of FSP EITF 03 6 1. We determined the adoption of FSP EITF 03 6 1 will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 30 In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142 3). FSP FAS 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP FAS 142 3 also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives. FSP FAS 142 3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of FSP FAS 142 3 will have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any controlling interest in the business and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R further requires that acquisition related costs and costs associated with restructuring or exiting activities of an acquired entity will be expensed as incurred. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements that will require disclosure on the nature and financial effects of the business combination. Additionally, in April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 141(R) 1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies (FSP FAS 141(R) 1). FSP FAS 141(R) 1 amends and clarifies SFAS No. 141R to address application issues on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. SFAS 141R and FSP FAS 141(R) 1 will impact business combinations that may be completed by the Company on or after July 1, 2009. We do not know if the adoption of SFAS No. 141R and FSP FAS 141(R) 1 will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as the impact depends solely on whether we complete any business combinations after July 1, 2009 and the terms of such transactions. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, except for non financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non recurring basis, for which the effective date is fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. On July 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 for assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We will adopt SFAS No. 157 for non financial assets that are recognized or disclosed on a non recurring basis on July 1, 2009 and do not anticipate it will have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., Employer Services payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services client related funds. We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties. Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. 31 We also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses (e.g. Dealer Services dealer management systems). For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation and post contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term as vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition. We assess collectibility of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. We do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectibility determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. Goodwill. We account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. We perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount. If an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount, we would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. We use discounted cash flows to determine fair values. We had $2,375.5 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2009. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated earnings. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. The Company accounts for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in accordance with the provisions of FIN 48, which was adopted by the Company on July 1, 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, it clarifies that an entitys tax benefits must be more likely than not of being sustained assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. As of June 30, 2009 and 2008, the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $92.8 million and $404.2 million, respectively. If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $20.5 million in the next twelve months. We do not expect any cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123R requires the measurement of stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binominal option pricing model. The binomial option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. Item 7A.
