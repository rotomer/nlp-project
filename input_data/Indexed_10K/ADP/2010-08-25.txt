ADPs fiscal 2010 was a challenging year and our results continued to be impacted by the economic downturn, including high unemployment levels, record low interest rates and volatile financial markets. However, as we look back over fiscal 2010, we were pleased that ADPs financial results were better than we initially anticipated. The economy showed signs of stabilization early on in the fiscal year. Demand for ADPs solutions increased and key business metrics, including Employer Services sales, retention and pays per control, began to improve during the second half of the year. Consolidated revenues grew 1%, to $8,927.7 million in fiscal 2010, from $8,838.4 million in fiscal 2009, aided by fluctuations in foreign currency rates, which increased revenues $68.2 million. In fiscal 2010, pretax earnings from continuing operations declined 2%, to $1,863.2 million, net earnings from continuing operations declined 9%, to $1,207.3 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 8%, to $2.40, from $2.62 in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 included favorable tax items that reduced the provision for income taxes by $12.2 million and $120.0 million, respectively. Excluding the favorable tax items from both years, net earnings from continuing operations declined 1% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined slightly from $2.38 to $2.37. Employer Services revenues were flat in fiscal 2010. In the United States, revenues from our traditional payroll and payroll tax filing business declined 4% for the full year and beyond payroll revenues grew 6% for the full year. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same store sales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 130,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, decreased 3.4% in fiscal 2010, but were slightly positive in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Worldwide client retention increased 0.4 percentage points as compared to the prior year. PEO Services revenues grew 11% in fiscal 2010 due to a 5% increase in the average number of worksite employees, as well as an increase in benefits costs and state unemployment insurance rates. Employer Services and PEO Services worldwide new business sales, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, increased 4%, to just over $1 billion in fiscal 2010. Dealer Services revenues decreased 3% in fiscal 2010 due to continued dealership consolidations and closings, lower transactional revenue and dealerships reducing services in order to cut their discretionary expenses. Consolidated interest on funds held for clients declined 11%, or $67.0 million, to $542.8 million. The decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 3.6% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 4.0% in fiscal 2009. Average client funds balances increased slightly as a result of wage growth and an increase in state unemployment insurance withholdings offset by the decline in pays per control. We have a strong business model, which has approximately 90% recurring revenues, excellent margins from the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention and low capital expenditure requirements. Additionally, ADP has continued to return excess cash to our shareholders. In the last five fiscal years, we have reduced the Companys common stock outstanding by approximately 15% through share buybacks, partially offset by common stock issued under employee stock based compensation programs. We have also raised the dividend payout per share for 35 consecutive years. 15 We are especially pleased with the performance of our investment portfolio and the investment choices we made. Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset backed securities with underlying collateral of sub prime mortgages, alternative A mortgages, sub prime auto loans or home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non investment grade fixed income securities. We own senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, rate reduction, and auto loan asset backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral. All collateral on asset backed securities is performing as expected. In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). We do not own subordinated debt, preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies. We do own AAA rated mortgage backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages. These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15 year and 30 year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. In addition, our AAA credit rating has helped us maintain uninterrupted access to the commercial paper market. Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2010, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1,775.5 million. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,682.1 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to $1,562.6 million in fiscal 2009. This increase in cash flows from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was due to tax refunds received and a reduction in cash bonuses paid, partially offset by an increase in pension plan contributions as compared to the prior year. In August 2010, we completed the acquisition of two businesses, Cobalt and Workscape, Inc. Cobalt is a leading provider of digital marketing solutions for the automotive industry. It aligns with ADP Dealer Services global layered applications strategy and strongly supports Dealer Services long term growth strategy. Workscape, Inc. is a leading provider of integrated benefits and compensation solutions and services. 16 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Total revenues $ 8,927.7 $ 8,838.4 $ 89.3 1 % Costs of revenues: Operating expenses 4,277.2 4,087.0 190.2 5 % Systems development and programming costs 513.9 498.3 15.6 3 % Depreciation and amortization 238.6 237.4 1.2 1 % Total costs of revenues 5,029.7 4,822.7 207.0 4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,127.4 2,190.3 (62.9 ) (3 )% Interest expense 8.6 33.3 (24.7 ) (74 )% Total expenses 7,165.7 7,046.3 119.4 2 % Other income, net (101.2 ) (108.0 ) (6.8 ) (6 )% Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,863.2 $ 1,900.1 $ (36.9 ) (2 )% Margin 20.9 % 21.5 % Provision for income taxes $ 655.9 $ 575.0 $ 80.9 14 % Effective tax rate 35.2 % 30.3 % Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,207.3 $ 1,325.1 $ (117.8 ) (9 )% Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.40 $ 2.62 $ (0.22 ) (8 )% Total RevenuesOur consolidated revenues grew 1% to $8,927.7 million in fiscal 2010, from $8,838.4 million in fiscal 2009, due to an increase in revenues in PEO Services of 11%, or $131.0 million, to $1,316.8 million, and fluctuations in foreign currency rates, which increased revenues $68.2 million. Such increases were partially offset by a decrease in Dealer Services revenues of 3%, or $38.5 million, to $1,229.4 million, and a decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients of $67.0 million. The decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 3.6% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 4.0% in fiscal 2009. Employer Services revenues were flat in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Total ExpensesOur total expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $119.4 million, to $7,165.7 million, from $7,046.3 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in our consolidated expenses for fiscal 2010 was due to our increase in revenues, higher pass through costs associated with our PEO Services business of $113.7 million, an increase of $48.6 million related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, an increase of $14.7 million related to additional domestic service personnel and incremental investments in our products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in severance expenses of $76.8 million, a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $28.4 million and our costs savings initiatives, which included lower compensation from reduced headcount and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses. 17 Our total costs of revenues increased $207.0 million to $5,029.7 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009 due to the increase in operating expenses discussed below. Operating expenses increased $190.2 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, due to an increase in PEO Services pass through costs that are re billable, including costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. These pass through costs were $988.5 million in fiscal 2010, which included costs for benefits coverage of $811.5 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $176.9 million. These costs were $874.8 million in fiscal 2009, which included costs for benefits coverage of $724.3 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $150.5 million. In addition, operating expenses increased $30.1 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and $14.7 million due to additional service personnel. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.9 million in stock based compensation expense and our costs savings initiatives, which included lower compensation from reduced headcount and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses. Systems development and programming expenses increased $15.6 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, due to incremental investments in our products during fiscal 2010. Additionally, systems development and programming expenses increased by $2.1 million due to expenses of acquired businesses and by $3.6 million due to the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by a $5.0 million decline in stock based compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $62.9 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease in expenses was due to a decrease in severance expenses of $76.8 million, a reduction in expenses of $31.1 million related to cost saving initiatives, which included lower compensation from reduced headcount and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses and a decline of $14.5 million in stock based compensation expense. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to the $15.5 million charge we recorded during fiscal 2009 to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an increase in estimated credit losses related to our notes receivable from automotive, truck and powersports dealers. These decreases in expenses were partially offset by an asset impairment charge of $6.8 million, recorded during fiscal 2010 as a result of the announcement by General Motors Corporation (GM) that it will shut down its Saturn division. In addition, there was an increase of $13.7 million due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase of $9.5 million in expenses of acquired businesses. Interest expense decreased $24.7 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Companys average borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.2% and 1.0%, respectively, which resulted in a decrease of $15.8 million in interest expense. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Companys average borrowings under the reverse repurchase program were approximately $425.0 million and $425.9 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively, which resulted in a decrease of $4.6 million in interest expense. Other Income, net Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 $ Change (Dollars in millions) Interest income on corporate funds $ (98.8 ) $ (134.2 ) $ (35.4 ) Realized gains on available for sale securities (15.0 ) (11.4 ) 3.6 Realized losses on available for sale securities 13.4 23.8 10.4 Realized (gain) loss on investment in Reserve Fund (15.2 ) 18.3 33.5 Impairment losses on available for sale securities 14.4 (14.4 ) Net loss (gain) on sales of buildings 2.3 (2.2 ) (4.5 ) Other, net (2.3 ) (2.3 ) Other income, net $ (101.2 ) $ (108.0 ) $ (6.8 ) 18 Other income, net, decreased $6.8 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to a $35.4 million decrease in interest income on corporate funds, a $14.4 million impairment loss on available for sale securities recorded during fiscal 2010 and a $2.3 million net loss on sales of buildings in fiscal 2010 as compared to a $2.2 million net gain on sales of buildings in fiscal 2009. Interest income on corporate funds decreased as a result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average daily balances. Average interest rates decreased from 3.6% in fiscal 2009 to 2.6% in fiscal 2010. Average daily balances increased from $3.7 billion in fiscal 2009 to $3.8 billion in fiscal 2010. These decreases in other income were partially offset by a gain on the investment in Reserve Fund of $15.2 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to a loss on the investment in the Reserve Fund of $18.3 million in fiscal 2009, as well as a $14.0 million increase in net realized gains on available for sale securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $36.9 million, or 2%, from $1,900.1 million in fiscal 2009 to $1,863.2 million in fiscal 2010 because the increase in revenues was more than offset by the increase in expenses and decrease in other income, net discussed above. Overall margin decreased 60 basis points in fiscal 2010. Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 and 2009 was 35.2% and 30.3%, respectively. For fiscal 2010, the effective tax rate includes a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $12.2 million related to the resolution of certain tax matters, which decreased the effective tax rate by 0.7 percentage points. For fiscal 2009, the effective tax rate includes a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $120.0 million related to an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit settlement and the settlement of a state tax matter, which decreased the effective tax rate by 6.3 percentage points. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing OperationsNet earnings from continuing operations decreased $117.8 million to $1,207.3 million in fiscal 2010, from $1,325.1 million in fiscal 2009, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 8%, to $2.40. The decrease in net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the impact of the tax matters discussed above. The decrease in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in earnings from continuing operations and the impact of the tax matters discussed above partially offset by the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 18.2 million shares in fiscal 2010 and 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2009. The following table reconciles the Companys results for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 to adjusted results that exclude the impact of favorable tax items. The Company uses certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate the Companys operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. The Company believes that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Companys management and improves their ability to understand the Companys operating performance. Since adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), they should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations, respectively, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 19 Year ended June 30, 2010 Earnings from Diluted EPS continuing operations Provision for Net earnings from from continuing before income taxes income taxes continuing operations operations As Reported $ 1,863.2 $ 655.9 $ 1,207.3 $ 2.40 Adjustments: Favorable tax items 12.2 12.2 0.02 As Adjusted $ 1,863.2 $ 668.1 $ 1,195.1 $ 2.37 Year ended June 30, 2009 Earnings from Diluted EPS continuing operations Provision for Net earnings from from continuing before income taxes income taxes continuing operations operations As Reported $ 1,900.1 $ 575.0 $ 1,325.1 $ 2.62 Adjustments: Favorable tax items 120.0 120.0 0.24 As Adjusted $ 1,900.1 $ 695.0 $ 1,205.1 $ 2.38 Net earnings from continuing operations, as adjusted, decreased $10.0 million to $1,195.1 million for fiscal 2010, from $1,205.1 million for fiscal 2009, and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, decreased $0.01, to $2.37. The decrease in net earnings from continuing operations, as adjusted, for fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. The decrease in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, for fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in net earnings from continuing operations, partially offset by the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of approximately 18.2 million shares during fiscal 2010 and the repurchase of 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2009. 20 Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Total revenues $ 8,838.4 $ 8,733.7 $ 104.7 1 % Costs of revenues: Operating expenses 4,087.0 3,898.4 188.6 5 % Systems development and programming costs 498.3 521.1 (22.8 ) (4 )% Depreciation and amortization 237.4 237.7 (0.3 ) 0 % Total costs of revenues 4,822.7 4,657.2 165.5 4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,190.3 2,359.1 (168.8 ) (7 )% Interest expense 33.3 80.5 (47.2 ) (59 )% Total expenses 7,046.3 7,096.8 (50.5 ) (1 )% Other income, net (108.0 ) (166.5 ) (58.5 ) (35 )% Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,900.1 $ 1,803.4 $ 96.7 5 % Margin 21.5 % 20.6 % Provision for income taxes $ 575.0 $ 647.7 $ (72.7 ) (11 )% Effective tax rate 30.3 % 35.9 % Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,325.1 $ 1,155.7 $ 169.4 15 % Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.62 $ 2.19 $ 0.43 20 % Total RevenuesOur consolidated revenues grew 1%, to $8,838.4 million in fiscal 2009, from $8,733.7 in the year ended June 30, 2008 (fiscal 2008), due to increases in revenues in Employer Services of 3%, or $211.1 million, to $6,438.9 million, and PEO Services of 12%, or $125.3 million, to $1,185.8 million. Such increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which reduced our revenue by $187.4 million, or 2%, a decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients of $74.7 million and a decrease in Dealer Services revenues of 3%, or $33.9 million. The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 4.0% in fiscal 2009 as compared to 4.4% in fiscal 2008, and a decrease in our average client funds balances for fiscal 2009 of 3.1%, to $15.2 billion. Total ExpensesOur consolidated expenses decreased 1%, to $7,046.3 million in fiscal 2009, from $7,096.8 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease in our consolidated expenses was due to a decrease of $160.7 million, or 2%, related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $168.8 million, which was attributable to lower selling expenses and cost saving initiatives that commenced in fiscal 2008 and continued in fiscal 2009. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $188.6 million attributable to the increase in our revenues discussed above. In addition, there was an increase in pass through costs in our PEO business including costs associated with providing benefits coverage for worksite employees of $102.7 million and costs associated with workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees of $16.8 million. 21 Our total costs of revenues increased $165.5 million, to $4,822.7 million in fiscal 2009, from $4,657.2 million in fiscal 2008, due to an increase in our operating expenses of $188.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in our systems development and programming costs of $22.8 million. Operating expenses increased $188.6 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO Services, which have pass through costs that are re billable including costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. These pass through costs were $874.8 million in fiscal 2009, which included costs for benefits coverage of $724.3 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $150.5 million. These costs were $755.3 million in fiscal 2008, which included costs for benefits coverage of $621.6 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $133.7 million. The increase in operating expenses is also due to higher expenses in Employer Services of $64.5 million related to increased service costs for investment in client facing associates. Such increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of approximately $83.7 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Systems development and programming expenses decreased $22.8 million, or 4%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to decreases related to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $15.8 million, a decrease in stock based compensation expenses of $6.5 million and a decrease in programming expenses related to our systems of $3.9 million. The decrease in programming expenses was a result of a decrease in the average cost per associate as a larger percentage of our associates are located in off shore and smart shore locations. In addition, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $0.3 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to decreases related to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $5.4 million, which were partially offset by increased amortization expenses of $4.7 million resulting from the intangible assets acquired with new businesses and the purchases of software and software licenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $168.8 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, which was attributable to decreases related to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $55.5 million, a decrease in selling expenses related to a decline in our new client sales of $45.6 million and a reversal of $23.3 million in expenses due to a favorable ruling related to an international business capital tax. In addition, the decrease is attributable to our cost saving initiatives that commenced in fiscal 2008 and continued in fiscal 2009, which included a reduction in payroll and payroll related expenses of $32.3 million and a decrease in stock based compensation expenses of $16.3 million. Such decreases were partially offset by an increase in severance charges of $67.6 million and an increase in the provision for our allowance for doubtful accounts of $15.5 million due to losses related to our notes receivable from automotive, truck and powersports dealers. Interest expense decreased $47.2 million in fiscal 2009 as a result of a decrease of $40.6 million related to our short term commercial paper program and a decrease of $6.6 million related to our reverse repurchase program. In the aggregate, interest expense decreased by approximately $68.4 million related to decreases in interest rates and increased approximately $21.2 million related to increases in borrowings. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, the Companys average borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 1.0% and 4.2%, respectively. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, the Companys average borrowings under the reverse repurchase program were approximately $425.9 million and $360.4 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively.

In the aggregate, interest income on corporate funds decreased by approximately $30.9 million related to decreases in interest rates and increased approximately $15.6 million related to increases in average daily balances. Average interest rates decreased from 4.4% in fiscal 2008 to 3.6% in fiscal 2009. Average daily balances increased from $3.4 billion in fiscal 2008 to $3.7 billion in fiscal 2009. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 5%, to $1,900.1 million in fiscal 2009, from $1,803.4 million in fiscal 2008, due to the increase in revenues and the decrease in expenses discussed above. Overall margin increased 80 basis points in fiscal 2009. Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was 30.3%, as compared to 35.9% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $120.0 million related to favorable tax settlements, including an IRS audit settlement and the settlement of a state tax matter. These settlements decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 6.3 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Lastly, during fiscal 2008, there was a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $12.4 million related to the settlement of a state tax matter. This decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 0.7 percentage points in fiscal 2008. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing OperationsNet earnings from continuing operations increased 15%, to $1,325.1 million, in fiscal 2009, from $1,155.7 million in fiscal 2008, and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20%, to $2.62 in fiscal 2009. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 reflects the increased revenues, lower expenses and lower effective tax rate as described above. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer weighted average diluted shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2009 and 32.9 million shares in fiscal 2008.

This adjustment is made for management purposes so that the reportable segments revenues are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This adjustment is a reconciling item to revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of this adjustment in consolidation. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are charged to the reportable segments based on managements responsibility for the applicable costs. The primary components of the Other segment are miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, non recurring gains and losses and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock based compensation expense. In addition, the reconciling items include an adjustment for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. This allocation is made for management reasons so that the reportable segments results are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. This allocation is a reconciling item to our reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of this adjustment in consolidation. Finally, the reportable segments results include a cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. This charge is a reconciling item to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of this charge in consolidation. Employer Services Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 RevenuesEmployer Services revenues increased $3.7 million to $6,442.6 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Revenues from our payroll and tax filing business declined 4% in fiscal 2010, due to a decline in pays per control and a decline in the number of payrolls processed, partially offset by pricing increases. Revenues from our beyond payroll services increased 6% in fiscal 2010, due to an increase in the number of clients utilizing our COBRA and HR Benefits solutions, as well as an increase in revenues related to our Retirement Services business due to an increase in the market value of the assets under management. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same store sales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 130,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, decreased 3.4% in fiscal 2010. Worldwide client retention improved 40 basis points, to 89.9%, and pricing increases contributed approximately 1% to our revenue growth for fiscal 2010. In addition, interest on client funds recorded within the Employer Services segment increased $2.7 million in fiscal 2010 due to a slight increase in average client fund balances. We credit Employer Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. 24 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEmployer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $36.3 million to $1,722.4 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to an increase in expenses of $40.0 million, which was partially offset by the $3.7 million increase in revenues discussed above. The increase in expenses can be attributed to $16.9 million of incremental investments in our products and an increase of $14.7 million related to increased service costs for investment in client facing associates. These increases in expense were partially offset by lower expenses resulting from our cost savings initiatives, which included headcount reductions at the end of fiscal 2009 and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 RevenuesEmployer Services revenues increased $211.1 million, or 3%, to $6,438.9 million in fiscal 2009. Revenues from our payroll and payroll tax filing business were flat for fiscal 2009. Our payroll and payroll tax filing revenues were adversely impacted in fiscal 2009 due to the reduced number of payrolls processed, a decline in pays per control and a reduction in the average daily balances held, but these declines were offset by pricing increases. Our worldwide client retention decreased by 1.2 percentage points during fiscal 2009. Lost business due to clients pricing sensitivity and clients going out of business increased during fiscal 2009 as a result of economic pressures. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same store sales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 137,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, decreased 2.5% in fiscal 2009. We credit Employer Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the Employer Services segment decreased $25.0 million, or 3.4% in fiscal 2009, as a result of a decrease in average daily balances from $15.5 billion for fiscal 2008 to $15.0 billion for fiscal 2009, related to lower bonuses, lower wage growth, and a decline in pays per control. The impact of pricing increases was an increase of approximately 2% to our revenue for fiscal 2009. Revenues from our beyond payroll services increased 8% in fiscal 2009 due to an increase in our Time and Labor Management and HR Benefits services revenues, due to an increase in the number of clients utilizing these services, partially offset by a decline in our Retirement Services revenues due to a decrease in the market value of the assets under management. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEmployer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $152.0 million, or 9%, to $1,758.7 million in fiscal 2009. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2009 grew at a faster rate than revenues due to a decrease of $57.7 million related to management incentive compensation expenses, slower growth in selling expenses of $36.2 million as compared to revenues due to a decline in our new client sales and our cost saving initiatives that commenced in fiscal 2008 and continued in fiscal 2009, including headcount reductions and curtailment of non essential travel and entertainment expenses. These decreases in expenses were offset, in part, by higher expenses of $64.5 million related to increased service costs for investment in client facing associates. PEO Services Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 RevenuesPEO Services revenues increased $131.0 million, or 11%, to $1,316.8 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, due to a 5% increase in the average number of worksite employees. The increase in the average number of worksite employees as compared to fiscal 2009 was due to an increase in the number of clients. Revenues associated with benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees that were billed to our clients increased $113.7 million due to the increase in the average number of worksite employees, as well as increases in health care costs. Administrative revenues, which represent the fees for our services and are billed based upon a percentage of wages related to worksite employees, increased $11.8 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2010, due to the increase in the number of average worksite employees. We credit PEO Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, PEO Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the PEO Services segment increased $0.7 million in fiscal 2010 due to the increase in average client funds balances as a result of increased PEO Services new business and growth in our existing client base. Average client funds balances were $0.2 billion in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. 25 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesPEO Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $9.0 million, or 8%, to $126.6 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes grew due to the increase in revenues described above, net of the related cost of providing benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees that are included in costs of revenues. In fiscal 2010, there was an increase in costs associated with providing benefits coverage for worksite employees of $87.2 million and costs associated with workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees of $26.5 million. In addition, earnings before income taxes increased $9.2 million due to the settlement of a state unemployment tax matter. Such increases in earnings before income taxes were offset by price concessions and higher pass through costs related to state unemployment taxes. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 RevenuesPEO Services revenues increased $125.3 million, or 12%, to $1,185.8 million in fiscal 2009 due to a 10% increase in the average number of worksite employees. The increase in the average number of worksite employees was due to new client sales. Revenues associated with benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees that were billed to our clients increased $119.5 million due to the increase in the average number of worksite employees, as well as increases in health care costs. Administrative revenues, which represent the fees for our services and are billed based upon a percentage of wages related to worksite employees, increased $15.3 million, or 7%, due to the increase in the number of average worksite employees. We credit PEO Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, PEO Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the PEO Services segment increased $1.5 million in fiscal 2009 due to the increase in the average client funds balances as a result of increased PEO Services new business and growth in our existing client base. The average client funds balances were $0.2 billion in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesPEO Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $15.6 million, or 15%, to $117.6 million in fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues described above, net of the related cost of providing benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees, which are included in costs of revenues. In fiscal 2009, there was an increase in costs associated with our PEO business related to costs associated with providing benefits coverage for worksite employees of $102.7 million and costs associated with workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees of $16.8 million. In addition, there was an increase in expenses related to new business sales of $2.0 million in fiscal 2009. Dealer Services Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 RevenuesDealer Services revenues decreased $38.5 million, or 3%, to $1,229.4 million in fiscal 2010. Revenues for our Dealer Services business would have declined approximately 4% for fiscal 2010 without the impact of acquisitions. Revenues declined $112.9 million due to client losses as a result of dealership closings, cancellation of services and continued pressure on dealerships to reduce costs. In addition, revenues decreased $25.1 million due to lower international software license fees and $5.3 million due to lower Credit Check and Computerized Vehicle Registration (CVR) transaction volume. These decreases in revenues were offset by a $90.0 million increase in revenues from new clients and growth in our key products during fiscal 2010. The growth in our key products was driven by increased users for Application Service Provider (ASP) managed services, growth in our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications and new network and hosted IP telephony installations. 26 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesDealer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $13.3 million, or 6%, to $201.0 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease was due to the decline in revenues of $38.5 million discussed above, which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses of $25.2 million. The decrease in expenses was due to certain cost saving initiatives, including headcount reductions at the end of fiscal 2009 and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses, offset by an asset impairment charge of $6.8 million as a result of the announcement by GM that it will shut down its Saturn division. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 RevenuesDealer Services revenues decreased $33.9 million, or 3%, to $1,267.9 million in fiscal 2009. Revenues for our Dealer Services business would have declined approximately 4% for fiscal 2009 without the impact of acquisitions. The decrease in revenues was due to client losses and cancellation of services resulting from the consolidation and closing of dealerships and continued pressure on dealerships to reduce costs, all of which resulted in a decrease to revenues of $72.9 million for fiscal 2009. In addition, revenues decreased $23.9 million due to lower Credit Check, Laser Printing, and CVR transaction volume and $9.5 million due to a decrease in revenues from consulting services and forms and supplies. These decreases in revenues were offset by a $67.8 million increase in revenues from new clients and growth in our key products during fiscal 2009. The growth in our key products was driven by increased users for ASP managed services, growth in our CRM applications and new network and hosted IP telephony installations. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesDealer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $5.8 million, or 3%, to $214.3 million in fiscal 2009 due to the decrease of $33.9 million in revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses of $28.1 million. The decrease in expenses was due to lower selling expenses of $11.4 million related to a decline in new client sales and a decrease of $13.2 million in expenses due to certain cost saving initiatives, including headcount reductions and curtailment of non essential travel and entertainment expenses, and a decrease of $7.1 million related to management incentive compensation expenses. Other The primary components of the Other segment are miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, non recurring gains and losses and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock based compensation expense. Stock based compensation expense was $67.6 million, $96.0 million and $123.6 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 27 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At June 30, 2010, cash and marketable securities were $1,775.5 million, stockholders equity was $5,478.9 million and the ratio of long term debt to equity was 0.7%. Working capital before funds held for clients and client funds obligations was $1,568.6 million, as compared to $1,515.5 million at June 30, 2009. This increase is due to cash generated from operations, partially offset by the use of cash to repurchase common stock, the use of cash for dividend payments and the use of cash for acquisitions. Our principal sources of liquidity for operations are derived from cash generated through operations and through corporate cash and marketable securities on hand. We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during fiscal 2010, and we held approximately $1.8 billion of cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2010. We also have the ability to generate cash through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short term repurchase agreements to meet short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,682.1 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to $1,562.6 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was due to a $158.7 million tax refund received by a Canadian subsidiary of the Company in fiscal 2010, an increase in cash flows due to lower cash bonuses paid to our employees and an increase in cash flows related to collections from our clients. Such increases in net cash flows provided by operating activities were partially offset by an increase in pension plan contributions as compared to fiscal 2009, which decreased cash flows by $106.0 million. Lastly, there was a $77.1 million decrease due to income taxes paid in fiscal 2010 as a result of the agreement reached during fiscal 2009 with the IRS regarding all outstanding audit issues with the IRS for the tax years 1998 through 2006. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $2,379.5 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to $644.1 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in net cash flows used in investing activities was due to the timing of purchases of and proceeds from the sales or maturities of marketable securities, which resulted in a net decrease to cash flows of $1,023.7 million and the timing of receipts and payments of cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations that resulted in a decrease to cash flows of $907.7 million. Such decreases to cash flows were partially offset by a reclassification, in fiscal 2009, from cash and cash equivalents to short term marketable securities of $211.1 million related to the Reserve Fund discussed below. The proceeds received related to the Reserve Fund have been included in proceeds from the sales and maturities of corporate and client funds marketable securities. Net cash flows provided by financing activities were $89.0 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to $468.4 in fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to a $1,460.0 million change in cash due to the repayment in fiscal 2010 of a $730.0 million commercial paper borrowing that was outstanding at June 30, 2009. In addition, there was a $186.0 million decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities due to an increase in cash used for repurchases of common stock. We purchased approximately 18.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $42.02 during fiscal 2010 as compared to purchases of 13.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $39.72 during fiscal 2009. Such decreases in cash flows of financing activities were partially offset by the net change in the client funds obligations of $1,135.2 million as a result of timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds obligations and an increase of $158.4 million in the proceeds from stock purchase plan purchases and exercises of stock options. Our U.S. short term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $6.0 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper. In August 2010, the Company increased the U.S. short term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $6.25 billion in aggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A 1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime 1 by Moodys. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At June 30, 2010, there was no commercial paper outstanding. At June 30, 2009, we had $730.0 million in commercial paper outstanding. Such amount was repaid on July 1, 2009. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, our average borrowings were $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.2% and 1.0%, respectively. The weighted average maturity of our commercial paper was less than two days in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. Throughout fiscal 2010, we had full access to our U.S. short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. 28 Our U.S. and Canadian short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements. These agreements are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have $2 billion available to us on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, there were no outstanding obligations under reverse repurchase agreements. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $425.0 million and $425.9 million, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. In June 2010, we entered into a $2.5 billion, 364 day credit agreement with a group of lenders. The 364 day facility replaced our prior $2.25 billion 364 day facility. In addition, we entered into a three year $1.5 billion credit facility maturing in June 2013 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The three year facility replaced our prior $1.5 billion five year facility, which expired in June 2010. We also have an existing $2.25 billion five year credit facility that matures in June 2011 that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the federal funds effective rate or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by us to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. We are also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through June 30, 2010 under the credit agreements. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $6.25 billion available to us under the credit agreements. Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset backed securities with underlying collateral of sub prime mortgages, alternative A mortgages, sub prime auto loans or home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non investment grade fixed income securities. We own senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, rate reduction, auto loan and other asset backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral. All collateral on asset backed securities is performing as expected. In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). We do not own subordinated debt, preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies. We do own AAA rated mortgage backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages. These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15 year and 30 year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. Capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2010 were $90.2 million, as compared to $167.6 million in fiscal 2009 and $186.3 million in fiscal 2008. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 related to our data center and other facility improvements to support our operations. We expect capital expenditures in the year ending June 30, 2011 (fiscal 2011) to be between $150 million and $170 million. 29 The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2010: (In millions) Payments due by period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations 1 year years years 5 years Unknown Total Debt Obligations (1) $ 2.8 $ 18.8 $ 3.6 $ 17.4 $ $ 42.6 Operating Lease and Software License Obligations (2) 143.9 169.9 79.0 30.5 423.3 Purchase Obligations (3) 262.6 282.6 164.8 710.0 Obligations related to Unrecognized 107.2 107.2 Tax Benefits (4) Other long term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets: Compensation and Benefits (5) 53.3 122.7 82.7 166.4 27.3 452.4 Acquisition related obligations (6) 7.1 7.1 Total $ 469.7 $ 594.0 $ 330.1 $ 214.3 $ 134.5 $ 1,742.6 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters. The estimated interest payments due by corresponding period above are $1.1 million, $2.2 million, $2.1 million, and $2.6 million, respectively, which have been excluded. (2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment and other assets. (4) We made the determination that net cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months, related to unrecognized tax benefits of $107.2 million at June 30, 2010, are expected to be zero. We are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period beyond the next 12 months in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid. (5) Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. (6) Acquisition related obligations relate to contingent consideration for business acquisitions for which the amount of contingent consideration was determinable at the date of acquisition and therefore included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability. In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2010, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2011, total $18,136.7 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $18,832.6 million of cash and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2010. The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, ADP Indemnity, Inc., provides workers compensation and employer liability insurance coverage for our PEO worksite employees. We have secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss reinsurance from third party carriers that cap losses that reach a certain level in each policy year. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO business. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, the net premium was $67.8 million and $60.8 million, respectively. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, we paid claims of $53.8 million and $43.6 million, respectively. At June 30, 2010, our cash and marketable securities included balances totaling approximately $208.6 million to cover the actuarially estimated cost of workers compensation claims for the policy years that the PEO worksite employees were covered by ADP Indemnity, Inc. In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties. 30 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities, and long term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees). Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment grade marketable securities. These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short term and long term fixed income securities are classified as available for sale securities. Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals. Consistent with those goals, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. Client funds assets are invested in liquid, investment grade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents. At June 30, 2010, approximately 79% of the available for sale securities categorized as U.S. Treasury and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies were invested in senior, unsecured, non callable debt directly issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short term financing arrangements to satisfy our short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client fund obligations, rather than liquidating previously collected client funds that have already been invested in available for sale securities. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such clients obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the clients funds in advance of the timing of payment of such clients obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client fund assets to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client fund assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available for sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $6 billion commercial paper program (rated A 1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime 1 by Moodys, the highest possible credit rating), our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and available borrowings under our $6 billion committed revolving credit facilities. However, the availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below. We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate bonds is BBB and for asset backed and commercial mortgage backed securities is AAA. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years. Commercial paper must be rated A1/P1 and, for time deposits, banks must have a Financial Strength Rating of C or better. 31 Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 2008 Average investment balances at cost: Corporate investments $ 3,839.2 $ 3,744.7 $ 3,387.0 Funds held for clients 15,194.5 15,162.4 15,654.3 Total $ 19,033.7 $ 18,907.1 $ 19,041.3 Average interest rates earned exclusive of realized gains/ (losses) on: Corporate investments 2.6 % 3.6 % 4.4 % Funds held for clients 3.6 % 4.0 % 4.4 % Total 3.4 % 3.9 % 4.4 % Realized gains on available for sale securities $ 15.0 $ 11.4 $ 10.1 Realized losses on available for sale securities (13.4 ) (23.8 ) (11.4 ) Net realized gains/(losses) on available for sale securities $ 1.6 $ (12.4 ) $ (1.3 ) As of June 30: Net unrealized pre tax gains on available for sale securities $ 710.9 $ 436.6 $ 142.1 Total available for sale securities at fair value $ 15,517.0 $ 14,730.2 $ 15,066.4 Our laddering strategy exposes us to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short term and long term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decreased by 50 basis points, from 3.9% for fiscal 2009 to 3.4% for fiscal 2010. A hypothetical change in both short term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a $9 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve month period ending June 30, 2011. A hypothetical change in only short term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short term investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a $5 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve month period ending June 30, 2011. We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment grade securities, primarily AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors, and for Canadian securities, Dominion Bond Rating Service. At June 30, 2010, approximately 85% of our available for sale securities held an AAA or AA rating. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than US and Canadian government or government agency securities. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. During fiscal 2010, we were exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. Dollar denominated short term intercompany amounts payable by a Canadian subsidiary to a U.S. subsidiary of the Company in the amount of $178.6 million U.S. Dollars. In order to manage the exposure related to the foreign exchange fluctuations between the Canadian Dollar and the U.S. Dollar, the Canadian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange forward contract, which obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $178.6 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1.15 Canadian Dollars to each U.S. Dollar on December 1, 2009. Upon settlement of such contract on December 1, 2009, an additional foreign exchange forward contract was entered into that obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $29.4 million U.S. Dollars at a rate of 1.06 Canadian dollars to each U.S. Dollar on February 26, 2010. The net loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts of $15.8 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 was recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010 and substantially offset the foreign currency mark to market gains on the related short term intercompany amounts payable. The short term intercompany amounts payable were fully paid by the Canadian subsidiary to the U.S. subsidiary by February 2010. 32 There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2010, 2009 or 2008. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2009 13, "Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements." ASU 2009 13 modifies the guidance related to accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables by providing an alternative when vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") or third party evidence ("TPE") does not exist to determine the selling price of a deliverable. The alternative when VSOE or TPE does not exist is the best estimate of the selling price of the deliverable. Consideration for multiple deliverables is then allocated based upon the relative selling price of the deliverables and revenue is recognized as earned for each deliverable. ASU 2009 13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, unless the election is made to adopt ASU 2009 13 retrospectively. In either case, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2009 13 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009 14, "Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements" ("ASU 2009 14"). ASU 2009 14 modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude (a) non software components of tangible products and (b) software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed, or leased with tangible products when the software components and non software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible products functionality. ASU 2009 14 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, unless the election is made to adopt ASU 2009 14 retrospectively. In either case, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2009 14 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., Employer Services payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services client related funds. We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties. Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. We also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses (e.g., Dealer Services dealer management systems). For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation and post contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term, as vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition. We assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. We do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. 33 Goodwill. We account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in accordance with ASC 350 10, which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. We perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount. If an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount, we would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach, which utilizes a discounted cash flow model. In addition, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate our discounted cash flow results. We had $2,383.3 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2010. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated earnings. Income Taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, an entitys tax benefits must be more likely than not of being sustained assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. As of June 30, 2010 and 2009, the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $107.2 million and $92.8 million, respectively. If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10.0 million in the next twelve months. We do not expect any cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Stock Based Compensation. We measure stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. 34 Item 7A.
