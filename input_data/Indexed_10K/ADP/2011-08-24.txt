DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS ADP is one of the worlds largest providers of business outsourcing solutions. Leveraging over 60 years of experience, ADP offers a wide range of human resource (HR), payroll, tax and benefits administration solutions from a single source. ADP is also a leading provider of integrated computing solutions to auto, truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle (RV) and heavy equipment dealers. The Companys reportable segments are: Employer Services, PEO Services and Dealer Services. A brief description of each segments operations is provided below. Employer Services Employer Services offers a comprehensive range of HR information, payroll processing, time and labor management, and tax and benefits administration solutions and services, including traditional and Web based outsourcing solutions, that assist employers in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America (primarily Brazil), Australia and Asia to staff, manage, pay and retain their employees. As of June 30, 2011, Employer Services assisted approximately 537,000 employers with approximately 628,000 payrolls. As of June 30, 2010, Employer Services assisted approximately 520,000 employers with approximately 614,000 payrolls. Employer Services categorizes its services as payroll and payroll tax and beyond payroll. The payroll and payroll tax business represents the Companys core payroll processing and payroll tax filing business. The beyond payroll business represents services such as time and labor management, benefits administration, retirement recordkeeping and administration, and HR administration services. Within Employer Services, the Company collects client funds and remits such funds to tax authorities for payroll tax filing and payment services and to employees of payroll services clients. PEO Services PEO Services provides approximately 6,100 small and medium sized businesses with comprehensive employment administration outsourcing solutions through a co employment relationship, including payroll, payroll tax filing, HR guidance, 401(k) plan administration, benefits administration, compliance services, health and workers compensation coverage and other supplemental benefits for employees. Workers compensation and employers liability deductible reimbursement protection is provided to PEO Services by ADP Indemnity, Inc. (ADP Indemnity), a wholly owned captive insurance company of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. whose results of operations are recorded in the Other segment. Premiums are charged to PEO Services by ADP Indemnity in exchange for which ADP Indemnity provides a policy to PEO Services that reimburses all workers compensation and employers liability claim expense resulting from worksite employee claims up to a $1 million per occurrence retention. At the beginning of each policy period, ADP Indemnity establishes the premium to be paid by PEO Services required to satisfy the expected ultimate workers compensation claims within the $1 million per occurrence retention based upon historical loss experience and the expected workers compensation loss estimate as determined by an independent actuary. PEO Services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss reinsurance from a wholly owned and regulated insurance carrier of American International Group, Inc. (AIG) that covers all losses in excess of the $1 million per occurrence retention and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in each policy year. The cost of the per occurrence and aggregate stop loss insurance is paid by PEO Services directly to AIGs wholly owned subsidiary and is incremental to the premium paid to ADP Indemnity. ADPs PEO Services business, TotalSourceSM, is the largest PEO in the United States based on the number of worksite employees. TotalSourceSM has 54 offices located in 23 states and serves approximately 241,000 worksite employees in all 50 states. 14 Dealer Services Dealer Services provides integrated dealer management systems (such a system is also known in the industry as a DMS), digital marketing solutions, including website, sales leads, email, search, display and social media marketing services and other business management solutions to auto, truck, motorcycle, marine, RV and heavy equipment retailers in North America, Europe, South Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific region.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are pleased with the strong results we achieved in fiscal 2011 coming out of a challenging year in fiscal 2010 and remain optimistic as we continue to see strengthening in our core business model, significant improvements in our key business metrics and strong growth from our strategic acquisitions. Our continued investment in product innovation, sales force and client service has had a positive impact and remains in support of our five point strategic growth program, which consists of: Strengthening the core business; Growing our differentiated HR Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) offerings; Focusing on international expansion; Entering adjacent markets that leverage the core; and Expanding pretax margin Consolidated revenues from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 increased 11%, to $9,879.5 million, as compared to $8,927.7 million in fiscal 2010. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and net earnings from continuing operations increased 4%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5%, to $2.52 in fiscal 2011, from $2.40 per share in fiscal 2010, on fewer shares outstanding. Fiscal 2010 included a favorable tax item that reduced the provision for income taxes by $12.2 million. Excluding this favorable tax item in fiscal 2010, net earnings from continuing operations increased 5% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 6% from $2.37 to $2.52. In fiscal 2011 we continued to enhance value to our shareholders by returning excess cash of $1.4 billion through dividends and our share buyback program while also investing $776 million in new acquisitions. Each of our business segments has continued to demonstrate core strength. Employer Services revenues increased 8% to $6,861.7 million, PEO Services revenues increased 17% to $1,543.9 million, and Dealer Services revenues increased 24% to $1,494.4 million in fiscal 2011. In the United States, revenues from our traditional payroll and beyond payroll Employer Services businesses grew 3% and 13%, respectively, in fiscal 2011 aided in part by acquisitions. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same store sales basis utilizing a subset of over 125,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, increased 2.4 % for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011. Our client retention level continued the improvement in trends seen from fiscal 2010 with a gain of 1.2 percentage points worldwide over last years level, ending at 91% for the year. The growth in PEO Services revenues is primarily due to a 12% increase in the average number of worksite employees as well as an increase in benefit costs and state unemployment insurance rates. Dealer Services revenues growth of 24% resulted mainly from the effects of the Cobalt acquisition in August 2010. Excluding the Cobalt acquisition, Dealer Services revenues grew 3%. Employer Services and PEO Services new business sales, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, grew 9% worldwide, to approximately $1,082.1 million in fiscal 2011. Dealer Services new business sales showed continued strength with growth primarily as a result of the recent acquisition of Cobalt. Consolidated interest on funds held for clients decreased approximately 0.5%, or $2.7 million, to $540.1 million from $542.8 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 3.2% in fiscal 2011 as compared to 3.6 % in fiscal 2010 with such decreases having been offset by 11% growth in average client funds balances resulting from our positive Employer Services metrics. 15 The safety, liquidity, and diversification of our clients funds are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy. We continue to promote this strategy by investing in a prudent and conservative manner in accordance with our investment guidelines with a predominant focus on AAA/AA securities. Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset backed securities with underlying collateral of sub prime mortgages, alternative A mortgages, sub prime auto loans or home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles, or non investment grade fixed income securities. We own senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, rate reduction, and auto loan asset backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral. All collateral on asset backed securities is performing as expected. In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Farm Credit Banks, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). We do not own subordinated debt, preferred stock, or common stock of any of these agencies. We do own AAA rated mortgage backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages. These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15 year and 30 year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. In addition, our strong long term and short term credit ratings have helped us maintain uninterrupted access to the U.S. commercial paper market. Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2011, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1,523.7 million. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,705.8 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to $1,682.1 million in fiscal 2010. This increase in cash flows from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 was due to positive year over year variances in the timing of our tax related estimated cash payments and receipts, offset by higher bonus payments, and increased pension plan contributions. The increase in cash used in investing activities is due to the timing of purchases of and proceeds from the sales or maturities of marketable securities, as compared to the prior year. The increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, as compared to the prior year. We have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, excellent margins, the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements. Additionally, ADP has continued to return excess cash to our shareholders. In the last five fiscal years, we have reduced the Companys common stock outstanding by approximately 13% through share buybacks, partially offset by common stock issued under employee stock based compensation programs. We have also raised the dividend payout per share for 36 consecutive years. 16 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change Total revenues $ 9,879.5 $ 8,927.7 $ 951.8 11 % Costs of revenues: Operating expenses 4,900.9 4,277.2 623.7 15 % Systems development and programming costs 577.2 513.9 63.3 12 % Depreciation and amortization 253.4 238.6 14.8 6 % Total costs of revenues 5,731.5 5,029.7 701.8 14 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,323.3 2,127.4 195.9 9 % Interest expense 8.6 8.6 Total expenses 8,063.4 7,165.7 897.7 13 % Other income, net (116.6 ) (101.2 ) 15.4 15 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,932.7 $ 1,863.2 $ 69.5 4 % Margin 19.6 % 20.9 % Provision for income taxes $ 678.5 $ 655.9 $ 22.6 3 % Effective tax rate 35.1 % 35.2 % Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,254.2 $ 1,207.3 $ 46.9 4 % Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.52 $ 2.40 $ 0.12 5 % Total Revenues Our consolidated revenues increased 11% to $9,879.5 million in fiscal 2011, from $8,927.7 million in fiscal 2010, due to an increase in revenues in Employer Services of 8%, or $485.0 million, to $6,861.7 million, PEO Services of 17%, or $227.1 million, to $1,543.9 million, and Dealer Services of 24%, or $288.5 million, to $1,494.4 million. In addition, revenues increased $19.6 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Total revenue would have increased approximately 6.3% without the impact of acquisitions. Total Expenses Our total expenses in fiscal 2011 increased $897.7 million, to $8,063.4 million, from $7,165.7 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in our consolidated expenses was due to an increase in operating expenses of $623.7 million, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $195.9 million and an increase in systems development and programming expenses of $63.3 million. Our total costs of revenues increased 14%, to $5,731.5 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010 due to an increase in operating expenses of $623.7 million and an increase in systems development and programming expenses of $63.3 million. 17 Operating expenses increased $623.7 million, or 15%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO Services, which has pass through costs that are re billable and which includes costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. These pass through costs were $1,182.2 million in fiscal 2011, which included costs for benefits coverage of $937.8 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $244.4 million. These pass through costs were $988.5 million in fiscal 2010, which included costs for benefits coverage of $811.5 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $176.9 million. The increase in operating expenses is also due to operating expenses related to businesses acquired of $230.6 million, and higher expenses in Employer Services of $47.4 million related to increased service costs for investment in client facing associates. Additionally, operating expenses increased due to the settlement of a PEO Services state unemployment matter that reduced operating expenses $9.2 million in fiscal 2010. Lastly, operating expenses increased $5.6 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Systems development and programming expenses increased $63.3 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, due to businesses acquired of $42.2 million and higher development expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $195.9 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in expenses was due to higher selling expenses of $75.6 million resulting from increases in headcount over prior year levels coupled with an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of acquired businesses of $96.1 million, an increase in stock based compensation expense of $5.9 million, and an increase in technology related security expenses of $8.1 million. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.6 million due to changes in foreign currency rates. Interest expense remained flat in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. In both fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Companys average borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.6 billion, at weighted average interest rates of 0.2%. In fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Companys average borrowings under the reverse repurchase program were approximately $505.2 million and $425.0 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, which resulted in an increase of $1.1 million in interest expense. Other Income, net Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 $ Change (Dollars in millions) Interest income on corporate funds $ (88.8 ) $ (98.8 ) $ (10.0 ) Realized gains on available for sale securities (38.0 ) (15.0 ) 23.0 Realized losses on available for sale securities 3.6 13.4 9.8 Realized gains on investment in Reserve Fund (0.9 ) (15.2 ) (14.3 ) Impairment losses on available for sale securities 14.4 14.4 Impairment losses on assets held for sale 11.7 (11.7 ) Net loss (gain) on sales of buildings (1.8 ) 2.3 4.1 Other, net (2.4 ) (2.3 ) 0.1 Other income, net $ (116.6 ) $ (101.2 ) $ 15.4 Other income, net, increased $15.4 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was mainly due to an increase in realized gains on available for sale securities of $23.0 million, and a decrease in realized losses on available for sale securities of $9.8 million, which together increased other income, net, $32.8 million. Such amounts were offset in fiscal 2011 by an $11.7 million impairment loss on assets held for sale and a $10.0 million decrease in interest income on corporate funds resulting from flat average interest rates at 2.6%, as compared to the prior year, coupled with declining average daily corporate funds balances which decreased from $3.8 billion in fiscal 2010 to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2011. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $69.5 million, or 4%, from $1,863.2 million in fiscal 2010 to $1,932.7 million in fiscal 2011 due to the increase in revenues partially offset by the increase in expenses discussed above. Overall margin decreased approximately 130 basis points in fiscal 2011 with approximately 90 basis points of the margin decline attributable to acquisitions. 18 Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 and 2010 was 35.1% and 35.2%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 is due to the resolution of certain tax matters in fiscal 2010 that resulted in a decrease to the effective tax rate of 0.7 percentage points for that period, offset by a decrease in federal and state income tax expense and a favorable mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions in fiscal 2011. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Net earnings from continuing operations increased $46.9 million to $1,254.2 million in fiscal 2011, from $1,207.3 million in fiscal 2010, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5%, to $2.52. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 reflects the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the impact of the tax matters discussed above. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 reflects the increase in earnings from continuing operations and the impact of the tax matters discussed above coupled with the effects of fewer shares outstanding. The following table reconciles the Companys results for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to adjusted results that exclude the impact of favorable tax items. The Company uses certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate the Companys operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. The Company believes that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Companys management and improves their ability to understand the Companys operating performance. Since adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), they should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations, respectively, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 reflects the increase in earnings from continuing operations described above coupled with the effects of fewer shares outstanding. 19 Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Total revenues $ 8,927.7 $ 8,838.4 $ 89.3 1 % Costs of revenues: Operating expenses 4,277.2 4,087.0 190.2 5 % Systems development and programming costs 513.9 498.3 15.6 3 % Depreciation and amortization 238.6 237.4 1.2 1 % Total costs of revenues 5,029.7 4,822.7 207.0 4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,127.4 2,190.3 (62.9 ) (3 )% Interest expense 8.6 33.3 (24.7 ) (74 )% Total expenses 7,165.7 7,046.3 119.4 2 % Other income, net (101.2 ) (108.0 ) (6.8 ) (6 )% Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,863.2 $ 1,900.1 $ (36.9 ) (2 )% Margin 20.9 % 21.5 % Provision for income taxes $ 655.9 $ 575.0 $ 80.9 14 % Effective tax rate 35.2 % 30.3 % Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,207.3 $ 1,325.1 $ (117.8 ) (9 )% Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.40 $ 2.62 $ (0.22 ) (8 )% Total Revenues Our consolidated revenues grew 1% to $8,927.7 million in fiscal 2010, from $8,838.4 million in fiscal 2009, due to an increase in revenues in PEO Services of 11%, or $131.0 million, to $1,316.8 million, and fluctuations in foreign currency rates, which increased revenues $68.2 million. Such increases were partially offset by a decrease in Dealer Services revenues of 3%, or $36.2 million, to $1,205.9 million, and a decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients of $67.0 million. The decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 3.6% in fiscal 2010, as compared to 4.0% in fiscal 2009. Employer Services revenues were flat in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Total Expenses Our total expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $119.4 million, to $7,165.7 million, from $7,046.3 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in our consolidated expenses for fiscal 2010 was due to our increase in revenues, higher pass through costs associated with our PEO Services business of $113.7 million, an increase of $48.6 million related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, an increase of $14.7 million related to additional domestic service personnel, and incremental investments in our products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in severance expenses of $76.8 million, a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $28.4 million, and our cost savings initiatives, which included lower compensation from reduced headcount and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses. Our total costs of revenues increased $207.0 million to $5,029.7 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009 due to the increase in operating expenses discussed below. 20 Operating expenses increased $190.2 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, due to an increase in PEO Services pass through costs that are re billable, including costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. These pass through costs were $988.5 million in fiscal 2010, which included costs for benefits coverage of $811.5 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $176.9 million. These costs were $874.8 million in fiscal 2009, which included costs for benefits coverage of $724.3 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $150.5 million. In addition, operating expenses increased $30.1 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and $14.7 million due to additional service personnel. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.9 million in stock based compensation expense and our cost savings initiatives, which included lower compensation from reduced headcount and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses. Systems development and programming expenses increased $15.6 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to incremental investments in our products during fiscal 2010. Additionally, systems development and programming expenses increased $2.1 million due to expenses of acquired businesses and $3.6 million due to the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by a $5.0 million decline in stock based compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $62.9 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease in expenses was due to a decrease in severance expenses of $76.8 million, a reduction in expenses of $31.1 million related to cost saving initiatives, which included lower compensation from reduced headcount and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses, and a decline of $14.5 million in stock based compensation expense. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to the $15.5 million charge we recorded during fiscal 2009 to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an increase in estimated credit losses related to our notes receivable from auto, truck and powersports dealers. These decreases in expenses were partially offset by an asset impairment charge of $6.8 million recorded during fiscal 2010 as a result of the announcement by GM that it will shut down its Saturn division. In addition, there was an increase of $13.7 million due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase of $9.5 million in expenses of acquired businesses. Interest expense decreased $24.7 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Companys average borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.2% and 1.0%, respectively, which resulted in a decrease of $15.8 million in interest expense. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Companys average borrowings under the reverse repurchase program were approximately $425.0 million and $425.9 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively, which resulted in a decrease of $4.6 million in interest expense.

Interest income on corporate funds decreased as a result of lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average daily corporate funds balances. Average interest rates decreased from 3.6% in fiscal 2009 to 2.6% in fiscal 2010. Average daily balances increased from $3.7 billion in fiscal 2009 to $3.8 billion in fiscal 2010. These decreases in other income were partially offset by a gain on the investment in Reserve Fund of $15.2 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to a loss on the investment in the Reserve Fund of $18.3 million in fiscal 2009 as well as a $14.0 million increase in net realized gains on available for sale securities. 21 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $36.9 million, or 2%, from $1,900.1 million in fiscal 2009 to $1,863.2 million in fiscal 2010 because the increase in revenues was more than offset by the increase in expenses and decrease in other income, net discussed above. Overall margin decreased 60 basis points in fiscal 2010. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 and 2009 was 35.2% and 30.3%, respectively. For fiscal 2010, the effective tax rate includes a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $12.2 million related to the resolution of certain tax matters, which decreased the effective tax rate 0.7 percentage points. For fiscal 2009, the effective tax rate includes a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $120.0 million related to an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit settlement and the settlement of a state tax matter, which decreased the effective tax rate 6.3 percentage points. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Net earnings from continuing operations decreased $117.8 million to $1,207.3 million in fiscal 2010, from $1,325.1 million in fiscal 2009, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 8% to $2.40. The decrease in net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the impact of the tax matters discussed above. The decrease in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in earnings from continuing operations and the impact of the tax matters discussed above partially offset by the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of 18.2 million shares in fiscal 2010 and 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2009. The following table reconciles the Companys results for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 to adjusted results that exclude the impact of favorable tax items. The Company uses certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate the Companys operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. The Company believes that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Companys management and improves their ability to understand the Companys operating performance. Since adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), they should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations, respectively, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 22 Year ended June 30, 2010 Diluted EPS Earnings from Net earnings from from continuing operations Provision for continuing continuing before income taxes income taxes operations operations As Reported $ 1,863.2 $ 655.9 $ 1,207.3 $ 2.40 Adjustments: Favorable tax items 12.2 12.2 0.02 As Adjusted $ 1,863.2 $ 668.1 $ 1,195.1 $ 2.37 Year ended June 30, 2009 Diluted EPS Earnings from Net earnings from from continuing operations Provision for continuing continuing before income taxes income taxes operations operations As Reported $ 1,900.1 $ 575.0 $ 1,325.1 $ 2.62 Adjustments: Favorable tax items 120.0 120.0 0.24 As Adjusted $ 1,900.1 $ 695.0 $ 1,205.1 $ 2.38 Net earnings from continuing operations, as adjusted, decreased $10.0 million to $1,195.1 million for fiscal 2010, from $1,205.1 million for fiscal 2009, and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, decreased $0.01 to $2.37. The decrease in net earnings from continuing operations, as adjusted, for fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. The decrease in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, for fiscal 2010 reflects the decrease in net earnings from continuing operations, partially offset by the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of approximately 18.2 million shares during fiscal 2010 and the repurchase of 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2009.

This adjustment is made for management purposes so that the reportable segments revenues are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This adjustment is a reconciling item to revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and is eliminated in consolidation. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are charged to the reportable segments based on managements responsibility for the applicable costs. The primary components of the Other segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity (a wholly owned captive insurance company that provides workers compensation insurance coverage for PEO Services worksite employees), non recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock based compensation expense. In addition, the reconciling items include an adjustment for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. This allocation is made for management reasons so that the reportable segments results are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. This allocation is a reconciling item to our reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and is eliminated in consolidation. Finally, the reportable segments results also include a cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. This charge is a reconciling item to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and is eliminated in consolidation. Employer Services Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenues Employer Services revenues increased $485.0 million, or 8%, to $6,861.7 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Revenues for our Employer Services business would have increased approximately 5.5% without the impact of acquisitions. Revenues from our payroll and tax filing business increased 3% in fiscal 2011 due to higher average client funds balances, improved worldwide client retention and an increase in pays per control in the U.S. We credit Employer Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the Employer Services segment increased $73.0 million in fiscal 2011 due to the increase in average client funds balances from $15.0 billion to $16.6 billion. Our worldwide client retention rate increased 1.2 percentage points in fiscal 2011 to 91.1%, from 89.9% in fiscal 2010. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same store sales basis utilizing a subset of over 125,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, increased 2.4% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011. Revenues from our beyond payroll services increased 13% in fiscal 2011 due to an increase in the number of clients utilizing our HR Benefits, Compliance and Retirement Services solutions, and approximately 3% growth related to acquisitions. 24 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Employer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $110.9 million to $1,831.5 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was due to the increase in revenues of $485.0 million discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $374.1 million. In addition to an increase in expenses related to increased revenues, expenses increased in fiscal 2011 due to increases in sales and service headcount over fiscal 2010 levels coupled with the effects of acquisitions. Overall margin decreased from 27.0% to 26.7% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, with approximately 110 basis points of margin decline attributable to acquisitions. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenues Employer Services revenues decreased $1.9 million to $6,376.7 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Revenues from our payroll and tax filing business declined 4% in fiscal 2010, due to a decline in pays per control and a decline in the number of payrolls processed, partially offset by pricing increases. Revenues from our beyond payroll services increased 6% in fiscal 2010, due to an increase in the number of clients utilizing our COBRA and HR Benefits solutions, as well as an increase in revenues related to our Retirement Services business due to an increase in the market value of the assets under management. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same store sales basis utilizing a subset of approximately 130,000 payrolls of small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, decreased 3.4% in fiscal 2010. Worldwide client retention improved 40 basis points, to 89.9%, and pricing increases contributed approximately 1% to our revenue growth for fiscal 2010. In addition, interest on client funds recorded within the Employer Services segment increased $2.7 million in fiscal 2010 due to a slight increase in average client funds balances. We credit Employer Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, Employer Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Employer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $34.8 million to $1,720.6 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to an increase in expenses of $32.9 million and the $1.9 million decrease in revenues discussed above. The increase in expenses can be attributed to $16.9 million of incremental investments in our products and an increase of $14.7 million related to increased service costs for investment in client facing associates. These increases in expense were partially offset by lower expenses resulting from our cost savings initiatives, which included headcount reductions at the end of fiscal 2009 and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses. PEO Services Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenues PEO Services revenues increased $227.1 million, or 17%, to $1,543.9 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to a 12% increase in the average number of worksite employees. The increase in the average number of worksite employees as compared to fiscal 2010 was due to an increase in the number of new clients and a 1.1 percentage point improvement in our client retention rate from 82.9% in fiscal 2010 to 84.0% in fiscal 2011. Revenues associated with benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees that were billed to our clients increased $184.9 million due to the increase in the average number of worksite employees as well as increases in health care costs. Administrative revenues, which represent the fees for our services and are billed based upon a percentage of wages related to worksite employees, increased $33.0 million, or 14%, in fiscal 2011 due to the increase in the number of average worksite employees. 25 We credit PEO Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, PEO Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the PEO Services segment increased $0.5 million in fiscal 2011 due to the increase in average client funds balances as a result of increased PEO Services new business and growth in our existing client base. Average client funds balances were $0.2 billion in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes PEO Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $10.1 million, or 8%, to $137.4 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased due to growth in earnings related to the increase in the number of average worksite employees. The increase was partially offset by the settlement of a state unemployment tax matter, which increased earnings before income taxes $9.2 million in fiscal 2010. Overall margin decreased to 8.9% in fiscal 2011 from 9.7% in fiscal 2010 due to a 70 basis point decline pertaining to the settlement of a fiscal 2010 state unemployment tax matter. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenues PEO Services revenues increased $131.0 million, or 11%, to $1,316.8 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, due to a 5% increase in the average number of worksite employees. The increase in the average number of worksite employees as compared to fiscal 2009 was due to an increase in the number of clients. Revenues associated with benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees that were billed to our clients increased $113.7 million due to the increase in the average number of worksite employees, as well as increases in health care costs. Administrative revenues, which represent the fees for our services and are billed based upon a percentage of wages related to worksite employees, increased $11.8 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2010, due to the increase in the number of average worksite employees. We credit PEO Services with interest on client funds at a standard rate of 4.5%; therefore, PEO Services results are not influenced by changes in interest rates. Interest on client funds recorded within the PEO Services segment increased $0.7 million in fiscal 2010 due to the increase in average client funds balances as a result of increased PEO Services new business and growth in our existing client base. Average client funds balances were $0.2 billion in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes PEO Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $9.7 million, or 8%, to $127.3 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes grew due to the increase in revenues described above, net of the related cost of providing benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees that are included in costs of revenues. In fiscal 2010, there was an increase in costs associated with providing benefits coverage for worksite employees of $87.2 million and costs associated with workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes for worksite employees of $26.5 million. In addition, earnings before income taxes increased $9.2 million due to the settlement of a state unemployment tax matter. Such increases in earnings before income taxes were offset by price concessions and higher pass through costs related to state unemployment taxes. Dealer Services Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenues Dealer Services revenues increased $288.5 million, or 24%, to $1,494.4 million in fiscal 2011. Revenues for our Dealer Services business would have increased approximately 3% for fiscal 2011 without the impact of acquisitions, which increased revenues $250.7 million. Revenues increased $37.8 million due to new clients, improved client retention, and growth in our key products. We had growth in both our North American and International client retention rates with each growing 3.9 and 0.8 percentage points, respectively, to 88.6% and 92.8%, in fiscal 2011. The growth in our key products was driven by increased users of application service provider (ASP) managed services, customer relationship management (CRM) solutions and growth in hosted IP telephony as well as an increase in transaction revenues due to higher credit report checks and vehicle registrations. 26 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Dealer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $32.9 million, or 16%, to $234.4 million in fiscal 2011. The increase was due to the increase in revenues of $288.5 million discussed above and was partially offset by higher compensation costs. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes also increased due to an asset impairment charge of $6.8 million recorded in fiscal 2010 resulting from the announcement by GM that it would shut down its Saturn division. Overall margin decreased from 16.7% to 15.7% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, which includes approximately 240 basis points of margin decline related to acquisitions, partially offset by the prior year effects of the Saturn impairment charge. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenues Dealer Services revenues decreased $36.2 million, or 3%, to $1,205.9 million in fiscal 2010. Revenues for our Dealer Services business would have declined approximately 4% for fiscal 2010 without the impact of acquisitions. Revenues declined $112.9 million due to client losses as a result of dealership closings, cancellation of services, and continued pressure on dealerships to reduce costs. In addition, revenues decreased $25.1 million due to lower international software license fees and $5.3 million due to lower Credit Check and Computerized Vehicle Registration (CVR) transaction volume. These decreases in revenues were offset by a $90.0 million increase in revenues from new clients and growth in our key products during fiscal 2010. The growth in our key products was driven by increased users for ASP managed services, growth in our CRM solutions, and new network and hosted IP telephony installations. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Dealer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $13.7 million, or 6%, to $201.5 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease was due to the decline in revenues of $36.2 million discussed above, which was partially offset by a decrease in expenses of $22.5 million. The decrease in expenses was due to certain cost saving initiatives, including headcount reductions at the end of fiscal 2009 and a reduction in travel and entertainment expenses, offset by an asset impairment charge of $6.8 million as a result of the announcement by GM that it will shut down its Saturn division. Overall margin decreased from 17.3% to 16.7% in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, due to the effects of the Saturn fiscal 2010 impairment charge. Other The primary components of the Other segment are miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, non recurring gains and losses, results of operations of ADP Indemnity, and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock based compensation expense. Stock based compensation expense was $76.3 million, $67.6 million, and $96.0 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. ADP Indemnity provides workers compensation and employers liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees up to a $1 million per occurrence retention. PEO Services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss reinsurance from a wholly owned and regulated insurance carrier of AIG that covers all losses in excess of the $1 million per occurrence retention and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in each policy year. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO Services business. Premiums are charged to PEO Services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the PEO Services worksite employees. Changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by ADP Indemnity. In each of fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, ADP Indemnity recorded an increase in total claims reserves related to changes in these estimated losses for all policy years of $39.2 million, $19.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Significant contributing factors to the increase in reserves have been the rapid growth of our PEO Services business in states with relatively higher workers compensation claim costs, adverse claim development, higher medical costs, and longer claim duration. Our net gains on the sale of available for sale securities were $34.4 million and $1.6 million in each of fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively, coupled with a net loss of $12.4 million in 2009. 27 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At June 30, 2011, cash and marketable securities were $1,523.7 million, stockholders equity was $6,010.4 million, and the ratio of long term debt to equity was 0.6%. Working capital before funds held for clients and client funds obligations was $1,252.2 million, as compared to $1,568.6 million at June 30, 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and other current assets together with the net effect of an increase in accounts receivable, accrued expenses and other, and accrued payroll and payroll related expenses. Our principal sources of liquidity for operations are derived from cash generated through operations and through corporate cash and marketable securities on hand. We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during fiscal 2011, and we held approximately $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2011. We also have the ability to generate cash through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short term repurchase agreements to meet short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,705.8 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to $1,682.1 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was due to a positive year over year variance in the timing of our tax related estimated cash payments and receipts of $118.4 million, offset by an increase in bonus payments of $47.0 million, and an increase in pension plan contributions of $45.8 million. The balance of the increase was due to timing of cash collections related to trade accounts receivable partially offset by the timing of cash payments related to accounts payable. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $7,340.6 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to $2,379.5 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in net cash flows used in investing activities was due to the increase of spend relating to acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, which resulted in a net decrease to cash flows of $676.0 million, the timing of purchases of and proceeds from the sales or maturities of corporate and client funds marketable securities which resulted in a net decrease to cash flows of $1,026.0 million, and the increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations which resulted in a net decrease to cash flows of $3,197.7 million. Net cash flows provided by financing activities were $5,339.3 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to $89.0 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was due to the net change in client funds obligations of $4,270.5 million as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, a $730.0 million decrease in repayments of previously issued commercial paper and a $237.2 million increase primarily due to higher cash proceeds from the exercises of stock options. We issued 11.4 million and 6.2 million treasury shares, respectively, related to option exercises in fiscal 2011 and 2010. Our U.S. short term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short term commercial paper program. In August 2011, the Company increased the U.S. short term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $6.75 billion in aggregate maturity value, up from $6.25 billion in fiscal 2011. Our commercial paper program is rated A 1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime 1 by Moodys. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. In both fiscal 2011 and 2010, our average borrowings were $1.6 billion, at weighted average interest rates of 0.2%. The weighted average maturity of our commercial paper was less than two days in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. Throughout fiscal 2011, we had full access to our U.S. short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. At June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, there was no commercial paper outstanding. 28 Our U.S. and Canadian short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have $2 billion available to us on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements. In fiscal 2011 and 2010, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $505.2 million and $425.0 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. At June 30, 2011 and 2010 we had no outstanding obligations under reverse repurchase agreements. In June 2011, we entered into a $2.0 billion, 364 day credit facility with a group of lenders. The 364 day facility replaced our prior $2.5 billion 364 day facility. In addition, we entered into a four year $3.25 billion credit facility maturing in June 2015 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The four year facility replaced our prior $2.25 billion five year credit facility, which expired in June 2011. We also have an existing three year $1.5 billion credit facility maturing in June 2013 that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to the committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the federal funds effective rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and to provide funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. The Company had no borrowings through June 30, 2011 under the credit agreements. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow there under, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $6.75 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset backed securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages, alternative A mortgages, sub prime auto loans or sub prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non investment grade fixed income securities. We own AAA rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, rate reduction, auto loan and other asset backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral. All collateral on asset backed securities is performing as expected. In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Farm Credit Banks, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") and Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"). We do not own subordinated debt, preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies. We do own AAA rated mortgage backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages. These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15 year and 30 year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short term funding requirement relating to client funds obligations. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poors (S&P) lowered the long term sovereign credit rating of U.S. Government debt obligations from AAA to AA+. On August 8, 2011, S&P also downgraded the long term credit ratings of U.S. government sponsored enterprises. As described above, in Notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, and in our discussion of Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, we hold U.S. Treasury and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies and related securities. We do not have the intent of selling these securities nor are we obligated to sell them as a result of the credit downgrade. Furthermore, we continue to believe that we will be able to recover the underlying payments of principal and interest due thereon. Capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2011 were $184.8 million, as compared to $90.2 million in fiscal 2010 and $167.6 million in fiscal 2009. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 related to our data center and other facility improvements were made to support our operations. We expect capital expenditures in the year ending June 30, 2012 (fiscal 2012) to be between $160 million and $180 million. 29 The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2011: (In millions) Payments due by period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations 1 year years years 5 years Unknown Total Debt Obligations (1) $ 2.8 $ 18.9 $ 3.6 $ 11.7 $ $ 37.0 Operating Lease and Software License Obligations (2) 131.0 187.3 90.9 31.3 440.5 Purchase Obligations (3) 194.6 250.4 75.8 520.8 Obligations related to Unrecognized Tax Benefits (4) 7.0 98.7 105.7 Other long term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets: Compensation and Benefits (5) 75.5 147.2 90.0 191.0 29.2 532.9 Acquisition related obligations (6) 7.0 7.0 Total $ 417.9 $ 603.8 $ 260.3 $ 234.0 $ 127.9 $ 1,643.9 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our debt and related matters. The estimated interest payments due by corresponding period above are $0.2 million, $0.3 million, $0.2 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, which have been excluded. (2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment and other assets. (4) We made the determination that net cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months, related to unrecognized tax benefits of $105.7 million at June 30, 2011, are expected to be up to $7.0 million. We are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period beyond the next 12 months in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid. (5) Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. (6) Acquisition related obligations relate to contingent consideration for business acquisitions for which the amount of contingent consideration was determinable at the date of acquisition and therefore included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a liability. In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2011, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2012, total $24,591.1 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $25,135.6 million of cash and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2011. ADP Indemnity provides workers compensation and employers liability deductible reimbursement protection for PEO Services worksite employees up to a $1 million per occurrence retention. PEO Services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss reinsurance from a select wholly owned and regulated insurance carrier of AIG that covers all losses in excess of the $1 million per occurrence retention and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in each policy year. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO business. Premiums are charged to the PEO to cover the PEO Services worksite employee expected claim expenses. Changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by ADP Indemnity, Inc. At June 30, 2011, ADP Indemnitys total assets were $223.2 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated cost of workers compensation claims of $212.7 million for the policy years since July 1, 2003. In fiscal 2011 and 2010, ADP Indemnity paid claims of $63.3 million and $53.8 million, respectively. At June 30, 2011, AIGs long term credit rating and financial strength ratings from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively, were A and A with stable outlook, and Baa1 and A1 with stable outlook. Should AIG and its wholly owned insurance company be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations, ADP would become responsible for satisfying the worksite employee workers compensation obligations. 30 In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities, and long term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees). Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment grade marketable securities. These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short term and long term fixed income securities are classified as available for sale securities. Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals. Consistent with those goals, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment grade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents. At June 30, 2011, approximately 93% of the available for sale securities categorized as U.S. Treasury and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies were invested in senior, unsecured, non callable debt directly issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Farm Credit Banks, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short term financing arrangements to satisfy our short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously collected client funds that have already been invested in available for sale securities. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such clients obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the clients funds in advance of the timing of payment of such clients obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations. There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available for sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $6.75 billion commercial paper program (rated A 1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime 1 (P1) by Moodys, the highest possible credit rating), our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions ($2 billion of which is available on a committed basis) and available borrowings under our $6.75 billion committed revolving credit facilities. In August 2011, the Company increased the U.S. short term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $6.75 billion in aggregate maturity value. However, the availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below. We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate bonds is BBB and for asset backed and commercial mortgage backed securities is AAA. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years. Commercial paper must be rated A1/P1 and, for time deposits, banks must have a Financial Strength Rating of C or better. 31 Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 2009 Average investment balances at cost: Corporate investments $ 3,467.6 $ 3,839.2 $ 3,744.7 Funds held for clients 16,865.4 15,194.5 15,162.4 Total $ 20,333.0 $ 19,033.7 $ 18,907.1 Average interest rates earned exclusive of realized gains/ (losses) on: Corporate investments 2.6 % 2.6 % 3.6 % Funds held for clients 3.2 % 3.6 % 4.0 % Total 3.1 % 3.4 % 3.9 % Realized gains on available for sale securities $ 38.0 $ 15.0 $ 11.4 Realized losses on available for sale securities (3.6 ) (13.4 ) (23.8 ) Net realized gains/(losses) on available for sale securities $ 34.4 $ 1.6 $ (12.4 ) As of June 30: Net unrealized pre tax gains on available for sale securities $ 570.9 $ 710.9 $ 436.6 Total available for sale securities at fair value $ 16,927.5 $ 15,517.0 $ 14,730.2 We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short term and long term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decreased by 30 basis points, from 3.4% for fiscal 2010 to 3.1% for fiscal 2011. A hypothetical change in both short term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a $9 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve month period ending June 30, 2012. A hypothetical change in only short term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short term investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a $3 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve month period ending June 30, 2012. We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment grade securities, primarily AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors, and for Canadian securities, Dominion Bond Rating Service. At June 30, 2011, approximately 86% of our available for sale securities held an AAA or AA rating. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. and Canadian government or government agency securities. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. During fiscal 2010, we were exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. Dollar denominated short term intercompany amounts payable by a Canadian subsidiary to a U.S. subsidiary of the Company in the amount of $178.6 million U.S. Dollars. In order to manage the exposure related to the foreign exchange fluctuations between the Canadian Dollar and the U.S. Dollar, the Canadian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange forward contract, which obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $178.6 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1.15 Canadian Dollars to each U.S. Dollar on December 1, 2009. Upon settlement of such contract on December 1, 2009, an additional foreign exchange forward contract was entered into that obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $29.4 million U.S. Dollars at a rate of 1.06 Canadian dollars to each U.S. Dollar on February 26, 2010. The net loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts of $15.8 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 was recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010 and substantially offset the foreign currency mark to market gains on the related short term intercompany amounts payable. The short term intercompany amounts payable were fully paid by the Canadian subsidiary to the U.S. subsidiary by February 2010. There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2011, 2010 or 2009. 32 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On July 1, 2010, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, and ASU 2009 14, Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements. ASU 2009 13 modifies the guidance related to accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables by providing an alternative when vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) or third party evidence (TPE) does not exist to determine the selling price of a deliverable. The alternative when VSOE or TPE does not exist is managements best estimate of the selling price of the deliverable. Consideration for multiple deliverables is then allocated based upon the relative selling price of the deliverables and revenue is recognized as earned for each deliverable. ASU 2009 14 modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude (a) non software components of tangible products and (b) software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed, or leased with tangible products when the software components and non software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible products functionality. The adoption of ASU 2009 13 and ASU 2009 14 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In December 2010, we adopted ASU 2010 20, Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. ASU 2010 20 requires greater transparency about an entitys allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables. The guidance is intended to provide disclosures to help facilitate the evaluation of the entitys credit risk, how that risk is analyzed and the reasons for changes in the allowance for credit losses. The adoption of ASU 2010 20 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In April 2011, we adopted ASU 2010 29, Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations. ASU 2010 29 requires an entity to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. ASU 2010 29 is effective prospectively for business combinations that occur on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2010 29 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 03, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements. ASU 2011 03 revises the criteria for assessing effective control for repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity. The determination of whether the transfer of a financial asset subject to a repurchase agreement is a sale is based, in part, on whether the entity maintains effective control over the financial asset. ASU 2011 03 removes from the assessment of effective control: the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial asset on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and the related requirement to demonstrate that the transferor possesses adequate collateral to fund substantially all the cost of purchasing replacement financial assets. ASU 2011 03 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of ASU 2011 03 will have on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The issuance of ASU 2011 04 results in global fair value measurement and disclosure guidance and minimizes differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011 04 requires an expansion of the information required for level 3 measurements and provides the updates to the existing measurement guidance. ASU 2011 04 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2011 04 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In June, 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU 2011 05 requires entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. ASU 2011 05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011 05 will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 33 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., Employer Services payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services client related funds. We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties. Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. We also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses (e.g., Dealer Services dealer management systems). For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation, and post contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term, as vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition. We assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. We do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. Goodwill. We account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in accordance with ASC 350 10, which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. We perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount. If an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount, we would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach, which utilizes a discounted cash flow model. In addition, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate our discounted cash flow results. We had $3,073.6 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2011. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth, synergies and or cost savings associated with our acquisitions. Income Taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 34 There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, the likelihood of an entitys tax benefits being sustained must be more likely than not assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. As of June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $105.7 million and $107.2 million, respectively. If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10.0 million in the next twelve months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Stock Based Compensation. We measure stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. 35 Statements of Consolidated Earnings (In millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 2009 REVENUES: Revenues, other than interest on funds held for clients and PEO revenues $ 7,805.5 $ 7,077.7 $ 7,051.7 Interest on funds held for clients 540.1 542.8 609.8 PEO revenues (A) 1,533.9 1,307.2 1,176.9 TOTAL REVENUES 9,879.5 8,927.7 8,838.4 EXPENSES: Costs of revenues Operating expenses 4,900.9 4,277.2 4,087.0 Systems development and programming costs 577.2 513.9 498.3 Depreciation and amortization 253.4 238.6 237.4 TOTAL COSTS OF REVENUES 5,731.5 5,029.7 4,822.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,323.3 2,127.4 2,190.3 Interest expense 8.6 8.6 33.3 TOTAL EXPENSES 8,063.4 7,165.7 7,046.3 Other income, net (116.6 ) (101.2 ) (108.0 ) EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 1,932.7 1,863.2 1,900.1 Provision for income taxes 678.5 655.9 575.0 NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 1,254.2 1,207.3 1,325.1 Earnings from discontinued operations, net of provision for income taxes of $7.0 and $0.7 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively 4.1 7.5 NET EARNINGS $ 1,254.2 $ 1,211.4 $ 1,332.6 Basic earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.54 $ 2.41 $ 2.63 Basic earnings per share from discontinued operations 0.01 0.01 BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE $ 2.54 $ 2.42 $ 2.65 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.52 $ 2.40 $ 2.62 Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations 0.01 0.01 DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE $ 2.52 $ 2.40 $ 2.63 Basic weighted average shares outstanding 493.5 500.5 503.2 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 498.3 503.7 505.8 (A) Professional Employer Organization (PEO) revenues are net of direct pass through costs, primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes, of $15,765.3, $13,318.7, and $12,310.4, respectively.

consolidated financial statements. 39 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A. Basis of Preparation. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADP or the Company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and accumulated other comprehensive income that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates. B. Description of Business. The Company is a provider of technology based outsourcing solutions to employers and vehicle retailers and manufacturers. The Company classifies its operations into the following reportable segments: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services, and Dealer Services. The primary components of the Other segment are miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, non recurring gains and losses, results of operations of ADP Indemnity, and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock based compensation expense. C. Revenue Recognition. Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., Employer Services payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services client related funds. The Company enters into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties. Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. The Company also recognizes revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses (e.g., Dealer Services dealer management systems). For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation, and post contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term, as vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist. The Company assesses collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. PEO revenues are reported on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings and are reported net of direct pass through costs, which are costs billed and incurred for PEO Services worksite employees, primarily consisting of payroll wages and payroll taxes. Benefits, workers compensation and state unemployment tax fees for worksite employees are included in PEO revenues and the associated costs are included in operating expenses. D. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Investment securities with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value. E. Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients. All of the Companys marketable securities are considered to be available for sale and, accordingly, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. 40 If the fair value of an available for sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the Company assesses whether it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery. If either of those two conditions were met, the Company would recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the securitys amortized cost basis and its fair value. If the Company does not intend to sell a security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related available for sale security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned. F. Long term Receivables. Long term receivables relate to notes receivable from the sale of computer systems, primarily to auto, truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle and heavy equipment dealers. Unearned income from finance receivables represents the excess of gross receivables over the sales price of the computer systems financed. Unearned income is amortized using the effective interest method to maintain a constant rate of return over the term of each contract. The allowance for doubtful accounts on long term receivables is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses related to the Companys existing note receivables. G. Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. The estimated useful lives of assets are primarily as follows: Data processing equipment 2 to 5 years Buildings 20 to 40 years Furniture and fixtures 3 to 7 years H. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. The Company performs this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount. If an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount, the Company would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. The Company determines the estimated fair value of its reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach which combines the income approach, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital; and the market approach, which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. I. Impairment of Long Lived Assets. Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. J. Foreign Currency Translation. The net assets of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect for each period, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in the periods. Gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Currency transaction gains or losses, which are included in the results of operations, are immaterial for all periods presented. K. Derivative Financial Instruments. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and are recognized as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in the fair value of the derivatives recognized in either net earnings from continuing operations or accumulated other comprehensive income, depending on the timing and designated purpose of the derivative. There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2011 or June 30, 2010. 41 L. Earnings per Share (EPS). The calculations of basic and diluted EPS are as follows: Effect of Effect of Employee Employee Stock Option Restricted Stock Years ended June 30, Basic Shares Shares Diluted 2011 Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,254.2 $ 1,254.2 Weighted average shares (in millions) 493.5 3.8 1.0 498.3 EPS from continuing operations $ 2.54 $ 2.52 2010 Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,207.3 $ 1,207.3 Weighted average shares (in millions) 500.5 2.2 1.0 503.7 EPS from continuing operations $ 2.41 $ 2.40 2009 Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,325.1 $ 1,325.1 Weighted average shares (in millions) 503.2 1.2 1.4 505.8 EPS from continuing operations $ 2.63 $ 2.62 Options to purchase 0.9 million, 14.0 million, and 32.9 million shares of common stock for the year ended June 30, 2011, (fiscal 2011), the year ended June 30, 2010 (fiscal 2010), and the year ended June 30, 2009 (fiscal 2009), respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices exceeded the average market price of outstanding common shares for the respective fiscal year. M. Stock Based Compensation. The Company recognizes stock based compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant. The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Companys stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of a stock option grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. N. Internal Use Software. Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a three to five year period on a straight line basis. For software developed or obtained for internal use, the Company capitalizes costs. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The Company also expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements, as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities. O. Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. The Company capitalizes certain costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of all software production costs upon reaching technological feasibility for a specific product. Technological feasibility is attained when software products have a completed working model whose consistency with the overall product design has been confirmed by testing. Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. The establishment of technological feasibility requires judgment by management and in many instances is only attained a short time prior to the general release of the software. Upon the general release of the software product to customers, capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized over a three year period on a straight line basis. Maintenance related costs are expensed as incurred. 42 P. Income Taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. The Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, the likelihood of an entitys tax benefits being sustained must be more likely than not, assuming that these positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. As of June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $105.7 million, and $107.2 million respectively. If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10.0 million. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Q. Workers Compensation Costs. The Company employs a third party actuary to assist in determining the estimated claim liability related to workers compensation and employer liability coverage for PEO Services worksite employees. In estimating loss development rates, we utilize historical loss experience, exposure data, and actuarial judgment, together with a range of inputs which are primarily based upon the worksite employees job responsibilities, their location, the historical frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. For each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers compensation claims cost estimates. The Company has secured specific per occurrence reinsurance that caps the exposure for each individual claim at $1 million per occurrence, and has also secured aggregate stop loss reinsurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in each policy year. R. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. In July 2010, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, and ASU 2009 14, Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements. ASU 2009 13 modifies the guidance related to accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables by providing an alternative when vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) or third party evidence (TPE) does not exist to determine the selling price of a deliverable. The alternative when VSOE or TPE does not exist is managements best estimate of the selling price of the deliverable. Consideration for multiple deliverables is then allocated based upon the relative selling price of the deliverables and revenue is recognized as earned for each deliverable. ASU 2009 14 modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude (a) non software components of tangible products and (b) software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed, or leased with tangible products when the software components and non software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible products functionality. The adoption of ASU 2009 13 and ASU 2009 14 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In December 2010, the Company adopted ASU 2010 20, Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. ASU 2010 20 requires greater transparency about a companys allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables. The guidance is intended to provide disclosures to help facilitate the evaluation of the Companys credit risk, how that risk is analyzed and the reasons for changes in the allowance for credit losses. The adoption of ASU 2010 20 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In April 2011, the Company adopted ASU 2010 29, Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations. ASU 2010 29 requires an entity to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. ASU 2010 29 is effective prospectively for business combinations that occur on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2010 29 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 43 In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 03, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements. ASU 2011 03 revises the criteria for assessing effective control for repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity. The determination of whether the transfer of a financial asset subject to a repurchase agreement is a sale is based, in part, on whether the entity maintains effective control over the financial asset. ASU 2011 03 removes from the assessment of effective control: the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial asset on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and the related requirement to demonstrate that the transferor possesses adequate collateral to fund substantially all the cost of purchasing replacement financial assets. ASU 2011 03 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of ASU 2011 03 will have on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The issuance of ASU 2011 04 results in global fair value measurement and disclosure guidance and minimizes differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011 04 requires an expansion of the information required for level 3 measurements and provides the updates to the existing measurement guidance. ASU 2011 04 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2011 04 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In June, 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU 2011 05 requires entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. ASU 2011 05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011 05 will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. NOTE 2. OTHER INCOME, NET Other income, net consists of the following: Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 2009 Interest income on corporate funds $ (88.8 ) $ (98.8 ) $ (134.2 ) Realized gains on available for sale securities (38.0 ) (15.0 ) (11.4 ) Realized losses on available for sale securities 3.6 13.4 23.8 Realized (gain) on investment in Reserve Fund (0.9 ) (15.2 ) 18.3 Impairment losses on available for sale securities 14.4 Impairment losses on assets held for sale 11.7 Net (gains) losses on sales of buildings (1.8 ) 2.3 (2.2 ) Other, net (2.4 ) (2.3 ) (2.3 ) Other income, net $ (116.6 ) $ (101.2 ) $ (108.0 ) Proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities were $3,305.1 million, $3,406.9 million, and $3,320.4 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. In fiscal 2009, the net asset value of the Primary Fund of the Reserve Fund (Reserve Fund) decreased below $1 per share as a result of the full write off of the Reserve Funds holdings in debt securities issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., which filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15, 2008. In fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a loss of $18.3 million to other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings to recognize its pro rata share of the estimated losses of the investment it held in the Reserve Fund. During fiscal 2010 and 2011, the Company received distributions from the Reserve Fund in excess of what was previously recorded in short term marketable securities and as such, recorded gains of $15.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, to other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. 44 In fiscal 2010, the Company concluded it had the intent to sell certain securities for which unrealized losses of $14.4 million were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, the Company realized impairment losses of $14.4 million in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings during fiscal 2010. The Company subsequently sold all securities that the Company previously concluded it had the intent to sell. During fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company sold buildings that were previously classified as Assets Held for Sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and, as a result, recorded net gains/(losses) of $1.8 million, ($2.3) million, and $2.2 million, respectively, in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. During fiscal 2011, the Company reclassified assets related to two buildings as Assets Held for Sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the carrying amount of the assets held for sale exceeded their fair value less costs to sell, the Company recorded impairment losses of $11.7 million. Refer to Note 9 for more information related to Assets Held for Sale. The Company has an outsourcing agreement with Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (Broadridge) pursuant to which the Company provides data center outsourcing services, which principally consist of information technology services and service delivery network services. As a result of this agreement, the Company recognized income of $113.0 million and $104.8 million in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively, which is offset by expenses associated with providing such services of $110.8 million and $102.6 million, respectively, both of which were recorded in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. The Company had a receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets from Broadridge for the services under this agreement of $9.5 million and $8.9 million on June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In fiscal 2010, Broadridge notified the Company that it would not extend the outsourcing agreement beyond its current expiration date of June 30, 2012. The Company continues to assess the impact on results of operations, if any, that this will have and does not currently anticipate this will have a material impact. NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by the Company have been included in the Statements of Consolidated Earnings since their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the excess purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, the allocations are subject to revision when the Company receives final information, including appraisals and other analyses, which typically occurs within one year from the date of acquisition. On August 16, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Cobalt, a leading provider of digital marketing solutions for the auto industry that aligns with Dealer Services global layered applications strategy and strongly supports Dealer Services long term growth strategy, for approximately $405.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The purchase price allocation for Cobalt is as follows: Accounts receivable, net $ 42.5 Goodwill 311.7 Identifiable intangible assets 111.6 Other assets 57.4 Total assets acquired $ 523.2 Total liabilities acquired $ 96.1 The Company determined the purchase price allocations for this acquisition based on estimates of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, utilizing recognized valuation techniques, including the income and market approaches. Goodwill for Cobalt, which is not deductible for tax purposes, resulted from the expected impact to Dealer Services long term growth strategy. Intangible assets for Cobalt, which totaled $111.6 million, included customer contracts and lists, software and trademarks that are being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 11 years. There is no contingent consideration relating to the Cobalt acquisition. 45 In addition to Cobalt, the Company acquired eight businesses in fiscal 2011 for approximately $370.6 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price for these acquisitions includes $1.6 million in accrued contingent payments expected to be paid in future periods. These acquisitions resulted in approximately $269.8 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled approximately $134.8 million, consist of software, customer contracts and lists and trademarks that are being amortized over a weighted average life of 9 years. In addition, the Company made $0.8 million of contingent payments in fiscal 2011 relating to previously consummated acquisitions. As of June 30, 2011, the Company had contingent consideration remaining for all transactions of approximately $7.0 million. The Company acquired five businesses in fiscal 2010 for approximately $101.0 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price for these acquisitions includes $3.7 million in accrued contingent payments expected to be paid in future periods. These acquisitions resulted in approximately $80.8 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled approximately $33.5 million, consist of software, customer contracts and lists and trademarks that are being amortized over a weighted average life of 7 years. In addition, the Company made $2.6 million of contingent payments in fiscal 2010 relating to previously consummated acquisitions. As of June 30, 2010, the Company had contingent consideration remaining for all transactions of approximately $7.1 million. The Company acquired four businesses in fiscal 2009 for approximately $62.7 million, which includes $6.4 million in accrued contingent payments expected to be paid in future periods and which is net of cash acquired. These acquisitions resulted in approximately $60.3 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled approximately $20.8 million, consist of software, customer contracts and lists and trademarks that are being amortized over a weighted average life of 9 years. In addition, the Company made $10.7 million of contingent payments in fiscal 2009 relating to previously consummated acquisitions. The acquisitions discussed above for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. NOTE 4. DIVESTITURES On March 24, 2010, the Company completed its sale of the non core Commercial Systems business (the Commercial business) for approximately $21.6 million in cash. The Commercial business was previously reported in the Dealer Services segment.

The unrealized losses and fair values of available for sale securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for a period of less than and greater than 12 months as of June 30, 2011 are as follows: Unrealized Unrealized losses Fair market losses Fair market Total gross less than value less than greater than value greater unrealized Total fair 12 months 12 months 12 months than 12 months losses market value U.S. Treasury and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies $ (12.1 ) $ 1,049.0 $ $ $ (12.1 ) $ 1,049.0 Corporate bonds (16.9 ) 945.2 (16.9 ) 945.2 Asset backed securities 0.5 0.5 Commercial mortgage backed securities 17.3 17.3 Municipal bonds (0.6 ) 35.0 (0.6 ) 35.0 Canadian government obligations and Canadian government agency obligations (1.3 ) 227.7 (1.3 ) 227.7 Other securities (3.7 ) 242.3 (3.7 ) 242.3 $ (34.6 ) $ 2,517.0 $ $ $ (34.6 ) $ 2,517.0 The unrealized losses and fair values of available for sale securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for a period of less than and greater than 12 months as of June 30, 2010 are as follows: Unrealized Unrealized losses Fair market losses Fair market Total gross less than value less than greater than value greater unrealized Total fair 12 months 12 months 12 months than 12 months losses market value U.S. Treasury and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies $ $ 28.0 $ (0.2 ) $ 6.5 $ (0.2 ) $ 34.5 Corporate bonds (9.0 ) 210.5 (9.0 ) 210.5 Asset backed securities 2.4 2.4 Commercial mortgage backed securities 2.1 2.1 Municipal bonds 10.0 10.0 Other securities (1.0 ) 10.6 (1.0 ) 10.6 $ (10.0 ) $ 263.6 $ (0.2 ) $ 6.5 $ (10.2 ) $ 270.1 50 Expected maturities of available for sale securities at June 30, 2011 are as follows: Maturity Dates: Due in one year or less $ 3,096.2 Due after one year up to two years 3,231.2 Due after two years up to three years 1,762.0 Due after three years up to four years 3,165.5 Due after four years 5,672.6 Total available for sale securities $ 16,927.5 In fiscal 2010, the Company concluded that it had the intent to sell certain securities for which unrealized losses of $14.4 million previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, the Company realized impairment losses of $14.4 million in other income, net on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings in fiscal 2010. For the securities in an unrealized loss position of $34.6 million at June 30, 2011, the Company concluded that it did not have the intent to sell such securities and that it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell such securities before recovery, in order to determine whether such losses were due to credit losses. The securities with unrealized losses of $34.6 million were primarily comprised of corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies. The Company evaluated such securities utilizing a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors including whether the Company expects to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security, information about current and past events of the issuer, and the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost basis. At June 30, 2011, the Company concluded that unrealized losses on available for sale securities held at June 30, 2011 were not credit losses and were attributable to other factors, including changes in interest rates. As a result, the Company concluded that the $34.6 million in unrealized losses on such securities should be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2011. NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is based upon the Companys principal or most advantageous market for a specific asset or liability. US GAAP provides for a three level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows: Level 1 Fair value is determined based upon quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities that are traded in active markets. Level 2 Fair value is determined based upon inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, including: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 Fair value is determined based upon inputs that are unobservable and reflect the Companys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based upon the best information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows). Available for sale securities included in Level 1 are valued using closing prices for identical instruments that are traded on active exchanges. Available for sale securities included in Level 2 are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of our Level 2 investments, a variety of inputs are utilized, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information. Over 99% of our Level 2 investments are valued utilizing inputs obtained from a pricing service. The Company reviews the values generated by the independent pricing service for reasonableness by comparing the valuations received from the independent pricing service to valuations from at least one other observable source. The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service. The Company has no available for sale securities included in Level 3. 51 The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. In certain instances, the inputs used to measure fair value may meet the definition of more than one level of the fair value hierarchy. The significant input with the lowest level priority is used to determine the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the Companys assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2011. Included in the table are available for sale securities within corporate investments of $134.3 million and funds held for clients of $16,793.2 million. Refer to Note 5 for additional disclosure in relation to corporate investments and funds held for clients.

RECEIVABLES Accounts receivable, net, includes the Companys trade receivables, which are recorded based upon the amount the Company expects to receive from its clients, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Companys receivables also include notes receivable for the financing of the sale of computer systems, primarily from auto, truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle and heavy equipment dealers. Notes receivable are recorded based upon the amount the Company expects to receive from its clients, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and unearned income. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of probable credit losses related to trade receivables and notes receivable based upon the aging of the receivables, historical collection data, internal assessments of credit quality and the economic conditions in the automobile industry, as well as in the economy as a whole. The Company charges off uncollectable amounts against the reserve in the period in which it determines they are uncollectable. Unearned income on notes receivable is amortized using the effective interest method. 52 The Companys receivables, whose carrying value approximates fair value, are as follows: June 30, 2011 June 30, 2010 Current Long term Current Long term Trade receivables $ 1,333.2 $ $ 1,076.3 $ Notes receivable 90.5 146.4 110.3 155.0 Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables (44.8 ) (39.6 ) Allowance for doubtful accounts notes receivable (5.7 ) (9.4 ) (9.4 ) (16.1 ) Unearned income notes receivable (8.4 ) (8.3 ) (9.9 ) (9.5 ) Total $ 1,364.8 $ 128.7 $ 1,127.7 $ 129.4 Long term receivables at June 30, 2011 mature as follows: 2013 $ 67.5 2014 45.4 2015 24.5 2016 9.0 2017 $ 146.4 The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts related to notes receivable based upon a specific reserve for known collection issues, as well as a non specific reserve based upon aging, both of which are based upon history of such losses and current economic conditions. Based upon our methodology, the notes receivable balances with specific and non specific reserves and the specific and non specific reserves associated with those balances are as follows: June 30, 2011 Notes Receivable Reserve Current Long term Current Long term Specific Reserve $ 0.6 $ 0.9 $ 0.6 $ 0.9 Non specific Reserve 89.9 145.5 5.1 8.5 Total $ 90.5 $ 146.4 $ 5.7 $ 9.4 June 30, 2010 Notes Receivable Reserve Current Long term Current Long term Specific Reserve $ 3.8 $ 6.6 $ 3.8 $ 6.6 Non specific Reserve 106.5 148.4 5.6 9.5 Total $ 110.3 $ 155.0 $ 9.4 $ 16.1 53 The rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts related to notes receivable is as follows: Current Long term Balance at June 30, 2010 $ 9.4 $ 16.1 Incremental provision 1.8 3.0 Recoveries (3.7 ) (6.8 ) Chargeoffs (1.8 ) (2.9 ) Balance at June 30, 2011 $ 5.7 $ 9.4 As of June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of notes receivable is approximately 6% and 10%, respectively. Notes receivable aged over 30 days past due are considered delinquent. Notes receivable aged over 60 days past due and notes receivable with known collection issues are placed on non accrual status. Interest revenue is not recognized on notes receivable while on non accrual status. Cash payments received on non accrual receivables is applied towards principal. When notes receivable on non accrual status are again less than 60 days past due, recognition of interest revenue for notes receivable is resumed. At June 30, 2011, the Company had $2.2 million in notes receivable on non accrual status, including $0.1 million of notes receivable aged over 60 days past due. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the credit quality of its financing receivables, utilizing aging of receivables, collection experience and charge offs. In addition, the Company evaluates economic conditions in the auto industry and specific dealership matters, such as bankruptcy. As events related to a specific client dictate, the credit quality of a client is reevaluated. The aging of the notes receivable past due at June 30, 2011 is as follows: Over 30 days to 60 days Over 60 days Notes Receivables $ 1.2 $ 0.1 At June 30, 2011, approximately 99% of notes receivable are current. During the twelve month ended June 30, 2011, the charge offs as a percentage of notes receivable were 1.9%. NOTE 8. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation at June 30, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: June 30, 2011 2010 Property, plant and equipment: Land and buildings $ 698.4 $ 700.1 Data processing equipment 791.0 731.3 Furniture, leaseholds and other 462.3 397.4 1,951.7 1,828.8 Less: accumulated depreciation (1,235.5 ) (1,155.0 ) Property, plant and equipment, net $ 716.2 $ 673.8 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment was $146.3 million, $152.6 million, and $155.8 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 54 NOTE 9. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE During fiscal 2009, the Company reclassified assets related to three buildings as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such assets were previously reported in property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company sold two of the buildings as of June 30, 2010. Additionally, during fiscal 2010, the Company reclassified assets related to one other building as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At June 30, 2010, the Company had $11.8 million classified as Assets Held for Sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to the two buildings that were subsequently sold during fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2011, the Company reclassified an additional two buildings as Assets Held for Sale that were previously reported in property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These two buildings remain in Assets Held for Sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2011 for $9.1 million. NOTE 10. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET Changes in goodwill for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: Employer PEO Dealer Services Services Services Total Balance as of June 30, 2009 $ 1,567.0 $ 4.8 $ 803.7 $ 2,375.5 Additions and other adjustments, net 80.6 1.4 82.0 Adjustments for discontinued operations (15.0 ) (15.0 ) Currency translation adjustments (36.3 ) (22.9 ) (59.2 ) Balance as of June 30, 2010 $ 1,611.3 $ 4.8 $ 767.2 $ 2,383.3 Additions and other adjustments, net 251.3 332.9 584.2 Currency translation adjustments 72.4 33.7 106.1 Balance as of June 30, 2011 $ 1,935.0 $ 4.8 $ 1,133.8 $ 3,073.6 In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that there was no impairment.

All of the intangible assets have finite lives and, as such, are subject to amortization. The weighted average remaining useful life of the intangible assets is 8 years (4 years for software and software licenses, 11 years for customer contracts and lists, and 8 years for other intangibles). Amortization of intangible assets was $171.9 million, 156.6 million, and $151.9 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 55 Estimated amortization expenses of the Companys existing intangible assets for the next five fiscal years are as follows: Amount Twelve months ending June 30, 2012 $ 169.4 Twelve months ending June 30, 2013 $ 127.8 Twelve months ending June 30, 2014 $ 95.2 Twelve months ending June 30, 2015 $ 69.5 Twelve months ending June 30, 2016 $ 53.2 The Company has not incurred significant costs to renew or extend the term of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2011. NOTE 11. SHORT TERM FINANCING In June 2011, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion, 364 day credit agreement with a group of lenders. The 364 day facility replaced our prior $2.5 billion 364 day facility. In addition, the Company entered into a four year $3.25 billion credit facility maturing in June 2015 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The four year facility replaced our prior $2.25 billion five year facility, which expired in June 2011. The Company also has an existing $1.5 billion three year credit facility that matures in June 2013 that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the federal funds effective rate or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. The Company had no borrowings through June 30, 2011 under the credit agreements. The Companys U.S. short term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $6.25 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper. In August 2011, the Company increased the U.S. short term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $6.75 billion in aggregate maturity value. The Companys commercial paper program is rated A 1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime 1 by Moodys. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. In both fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Companys average borrowings were $1.6 billion, at weighted average interest rates of 0.2%. The weighted average maturity of the Companys commercial paper in fiscal 2011 and 2010 was less than two days for both fiscal years. The Companys U.S. and Canadian short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements. These agreements are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. The Company has $2.0 billion available to it on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2011 and 2010, there were no outstanding obligations under reverse repurchase agreements. In fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $505.2 million and $425.0 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively. NOTE 12. DEBT Components of long term debt are as follows: June 30, 2011 2010 Industrial revenue bonds (with variable interest rates from 0.4% to 1.1%) $ 21.6 $ 25.4 Secured financing 15.4 17.2 37.0 42.6 Less: current portion (2.8 ) (2.8 ) $ 34.2 $ 39.8 56 During fiscal 2008, the Company entered into a secured financing agreement, whereby the Company borrowed $21.1 million from a third party in exchange for a security interest in a single clients unbilled accounts receivable, which is billable over a ten year period. The Company will continue to collect amounts due from the client as they are billed. The security interest in the receivables retained by the third party is without recourse against the Company in the event that the client does not make the appropriate payments to the Company. As of June 30, 2011, the Company has recorded approximately $2.8 million within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and approximately $12.6 million within long term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the secured financing arrangement. The fair value of the industrial revenue bonds and other debt, included above, approximates carrying value. Long term debt repayments at June 30, 2011 are due as follows: 2013 $ 17.1 2014 1.8 2015 1.8 2016 1.8 2017 1.8 Thereafter 9.9 $ 34.2 Cash payments relating to interest on long term debt and the short term financing arrangements described in Note 11 were approximately $8.8 million, $8.9 million, and $40.1 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. NOTE 13. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. During fiscal 2010, the Company was exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. Dollar denominated short term intercompany amounts payable by a Canadian subsidiary to a U.S. subsidiary of the Company in the amount of $178.6 million U.S. Dollars. In order to manage the exposure related to the foreign exchange fluctuations between the Canadian Dollar and the U.S. Dollar, the Canadian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange forward contract, which obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $178.6 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1.15 Canadian Dollars to each U.S. Dollar on December 1, 2009. Upon settlement of such contract on December 1, 2009, an additional foreign exchange forward contract was entered into that obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $29.4 million U.S. Dollars at a rate of 1.06 Canadian dollars to each U.S. Dollar on February 26, 2010. The net loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts of $15.8 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 was recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010 and substantially offset the foreign currency mark to market gains and losses on the related short term intercompany amounts payable. The short term intercompany amounts payable were fully paid by the Canadian subsidiary to the U.S. subsidiary by February 2010. There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2011, 2010, or 2009. NOTE 14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS A. Stock Plans. The Company recognizes stock based compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. Stock based compensation consists of the following: Stock Options. Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the dates of grant. Stock options are issued under a grade vesting schedule. Options granted prior to July 1, 2008 generally vest ratably over five years and have a term of 10 years. Options granted after July 1, 2008 generally vest ratably over four years and have a term of 10 years. Compensation expense for stock options is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the stock option award. 57 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to January 1, 2009, the Company offered an employee stock purchase plan that allowed eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 85% of the market value for the common stock at the date the purchase price for the offering was determined. No further compensation expense related to this stock purchase plan was recorded after completion of the vesting period of the final offering under such plan on December 31, 2009. Subsequent to June 30, 2009, the Company offers an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 95% of the market value for the Companys common stock on the last day of the offering period. This plan has been deemed non compensatory and therefore, no compensation expense has been recorded. Restricted Stock. Time Based Restricted Stock. The Company has issued time based restricted stock to certain key employees. These shares are restricted as to transfer and in certain circumstances must be returned to the Company at the original purchase price. The Company records stock compensation expense relating to the issuance of restricted stock based on market prices on the date of grant on a straight line basis over the period in which the transfer restrictions exist, which is up to five years from the date of grant. Performance Based Restricted Stock. The performance based restricted stock program has a one year performance period, and a subsequent six month service period. Under this program, the Company communicates "target awards" to employees at the beginning of the performance period and, as such, dividends are not paid in respect of the "target awards" during the performance period. After the performance period, if the performance targets are achieved, associates are eligible to receive dividends on shares awarded under the program. The performance target is based on earnings per share growth over the performance period, with possible payouts ranging from 0% to 150% of the "target awards." Stock based compensation expense is measured based upon the fair value of the award on the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of approximately 18 months, based upon the probability that the performance target will be met. The Company currently utilizes treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Companys employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock awards. Stock based compensation expense of $76.3 million, $67.6 million, and $96.0 million was recognized in earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, as well as related tax benefits of $28.2 million, $22.3 million, and $27.6 million, respectively. Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 2009 Operating expenses $ 13.1 $ 11.7 $ 20.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 51.8 45.9 60.4 System development and programming costs 11.4 10.0 15.0 Total pretax stock based compensation expense $ 76.3 $ 67.6 $ 96.0 As of June 30, 2011, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options and restricted stock awards amounted to $9.6 million and $42.8 million, respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service period of 1.5 years and 1.1 years, respectively. 58 In fiscal 2011, the following activity occurred under our existing plans: Stock Options: Number of Options Weighted Average Price Year ended June 30, 2011 (in thousands) (in dollars) Options outstanding, beginning of year 35,000 $ 41 Options granted 1,398 $ 38 Options exercised (11,403 ) $ 41 Options canceled (3,281 ) $ 53 Options outstanding, end of year 21,714 $ 40 Options exercisable, end of year 17,823 $ 39 Shares available for future grants, end of year 30,153 Shares reserved for issuance under stock option plans, end of year 51,867 Performance Based Restricted Stock: Number of Shares (in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2011 Restricted shares outstanding, beginning of year 1,112 Restricted shares granted 1,388 Restricted shares vested (1,077 ) Restricted shares forfeited (72 ) Restricted shares outstanding, end of year 1,351 Time Based Restricted Stock: Number of Shares (in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2011 Restricted shares outstanding, beginning of year 475 Restricted shares granted 89 Restricted shares vested (45 ) Restricted shares forfeited (26 ) Restricted shares outstanding, end of year 493 The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and exercisable as of June 30, 2011 was $284.1 million and $237.7 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options exercised in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $95.7 million, $29.1 million and $19.7 million, respectively. 59 Summarized information about stock options outstanding as of June 30, 2011 is as follows: Outstanding Exercisable Weighted Weighted Exercise Number Remaining Average Number Remaining Average Price of Options Life Price of Options Life Price Range (in thousands) (in years) (in dollars) (in thousands) (in years) (in dollars) Under $25 298 1.7 $ 17 73 1.4 $ 17 $25 to $35 1,587 1.5 $ 31 1,531 1.3 $ 31 $35 to $45 17,790 3.8 $ 40 15,020 3.4 $ 40 $45 to $55 2,039 3.8 $ 47 1,199 1.3 $ 46 21,714 3.6 $ 40 17,823 3.0 $ 39 In fiscal 2010, the Company issued 1.4 million shares in connection with the final compensatory employee stock purchase plan offering that vested on December 31, 2009. The fair value of each stock option issued prior to January 1, 2005 was estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes option pricing model. For stock options issued on or after January 1, 2005, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Companys stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The fair value for stock options granted was estimated at the date of grant using the following assumptions: Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 2009 Risk free interest rate 1.4% 2.4 % 2.3% 2.6 % 1.8% 3.1 % Dividend yield 2.9% 3.3 % 3.2% 3.4 % 2.6% 3.5 % Weighted average volatility factor 24.5% 24.9 % 25.9% 30.4 % 25.3% 31.3 % Weighted average expected life (in years) 5.1 5.2 5.0 5.1 5.0 Fair value $7.59 $7.05 $7.54 The weighted average fair values of restricted stock plan issuances were as follows: Year ended June 30, 2011 Performance based restricted stock $ 40.20 Time based restricted stock $ 44.58 B. Pension Plans. The Company has a defined benefit cash balance pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees, under which employees are credited with a percentage of base pay plus interest. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on the ten year U.S. Treasury rate. Employees are fully vested upon completion of three years of service. The Companys policy is to make contributions within the range determined by generally accepted actuarial principles. In addition, the Company has various retirement plans for its non U.S. employees and maintains a Supplemental Officers Retirement Plan (SORP). The SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company pays supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers years of service and compensation. A June 30 measurement date was used in determining the Companys benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets. The Company is required to (a) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans net overfunded status or a liability for a plans net underfunded status, (b) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the year in which the changes occur in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 60 The Companys pension plans funded status as of June 30, 2011 and 2010 is as follows: June 30, 2011 2010 Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 981.7 $ 787.0 Actual return on plan assets 208.1 117.6 Employer contributions 158.1 112.3 Benefits paid (34.6 ) (35.2 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 1,313.3 $ 981.7 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,087.9 $ 894.9 Service cost 52.5 47.6 Interest cost 56.6 59.1 Actuarial (gains)/ losses (5.4 ) 128.8 Currency translation adjustments 14.5 (7.3 ) Benefits paid (34.6 ) (35.2 ) Acquisitions 7.3 Projected benefit obligation at end of year $ 1,178.8 $ 1,087.9 Funded status plan assets less benefit obligations $ 134.5 $ (106.2 ) The amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2011 and 2010 consisted of: June 30, 2011 2010 Noncurrent assets $ 231.5 $ Current liabilities (4.5 ) (3.9 ) Noncurrent liabilities (92.5 ) (102.3 ) Net amount recognized $ 134.5 $ (106.2 ) The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1,167.4 million and $1,078.5 million at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Companys pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of June 30, 2011 and 2010 had the following projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets: June 30, 2011 2010 Projected benefit obligation $ 150.7 $ 1,054.4 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 143.2 $ 1,048.3 Fair value of plan assets $ 55.6 $ 951.0 61 The components of net pension costs were as follows: Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 2009 Service cost benefits earned during the period $ 52.5 $ 47.6 $ 46.2 Interest cost on projected benefits 56.6 59.1 56.7 Expected return on plan assets (88.5 ) (76.5 ) (70.3 ) Amortization of losses 20.1 4.5 1.2 $ 40.7 $ 34.7 $ 33.8 The net actuarial loss, prior service cost and transition obligation for the defined benefit pension plans that are included in accumulated other comprehensive income that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost are $276.0 million, $1.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively, at June 30, 2011. The estimated net actuarial loss, prior service cost, and transition obligation for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost over the next fiscal year are $13.7 million, $0.2 million, and $1.1 million, respectively, at June 30, 2011. Assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were: Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 Discount rate 5.40 % 5.25 % Increase in compensation levels 4.00 % 5.50 % Assumptions used to determine the net pension expense generally were: Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 2009 Discount rate 5.25 % 6.80 % 6.95 % Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.25 % 7.25 % 7.25 % Increase in compensation levels 5.50 % 5.50 % 5.50 % The discount rate is based upon published rates for high quality fixed income investments that produce cash flows that approximate the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments. The expected long term rate of return on assets is determined based on historical and expected future rates of return on plan assets considering the target asset mix and the long term investment strategy. Plan Assets The Companys pension plans asset allocations at June 30, 2011 and 2010 by asset category were as follows: 2011 2010 United States Fixed Income Securities 38 % 37 % United States Equity Securities 41 % 42 % International Securities 21 % 21 % Total 100 % 100 % The Companys pension plans asset investment strategy is designed to ensure prudent management of assets, consistent with long term return objectives and the prompt fulfillment of all pension plan obligations. The investment strategy and asset mix were developed in coordination with an asset liability study conducted by external consultants to maximize the funded ratio with the least amount of volatility. 62 The pension plans assets are currently invested in various asset classes with differing expected rates of return, correlations and volatilities, including large capitalization and small capitalization U.S. equities, international equities, U.S. fixed income securities and cash. The target asset allocation ranges are generally as follows: United States Fixed Income Securities 35% 45% United States Equity Securities 37% 50% International Equity Securities 12% 20% The pension plans fixed income portfolio is designed to match the duration and liquidity characteristics of the pension plans liabilities. In addition, the pension plans invest only in investment grade debt securities to ensure preservation of capital. The pension plans equity portfolios are subject to diversification guidelines to reduce the impact of losses in single investments. Investment managers are prohibited from buying or selling commodities and from the short selling of securities. None of the pension plans assets are directly invested in the Companys stock, although the pension plans may hold a minimal amount of Company stock to the extent of the Companys participation in the S&P 500 Index. Plan investments included in Level 1 are valued using closing prices for identical instruments that are traded on active exchanges. Plan investments included in Level 2 are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service, which are reviewed by the Company for reasonableness. To determine the fair value of our Level 2 plan assets, a variety of inputs are utilized, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information. The Plan has no Level 3 investments at June 30, 2011. The following table presents the investments of the pension plans measured at fair value at June 30, 2011: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Comingled trusts $ $ 529.7 $ $ 529.7 U.S. Government securities 207.4 207.4 Mutual funds 283.4 283.4 Corporate and municipal bonds 237.7 237.7 Mortgage backed security bonds 33.1 33.1 Total pension assets $ 283.4 $ 1,007.9 $ $ 1,291.3 In addition to the investments in the above table, the pension plans also held cash and cash equivalents of $22.0 million as of June 30, 2011. The following table presents the investments of the pension plans measured at fair value at June 30, 2010: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Comingled trusts $ $ 357.1 $ $ 357.1 U.S. Government securities 191.3 191.3 Mutual funds 252.1 252.1 Corporate and municipal bonds 160.1 160.1 Mortgage backed security bonds 0.7 0.7 Total pension assets $ 252.1 $ 709.2 $ $ 961.3 63 In addition to the investments in the above table, the pension funds also held cash and cash equivalents of $20.4 million as of June 30, 2010. Contributions During fiscal 2011, the Company contributed $158.1 million to the pension plans. In July 2011 the Company contributed $75.0 million to the pension plans and expects to contribute an additional $8.6 million to the pension plans during its fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 (fiscal 2012). Estimated Future Benefit Payments The benefits expected to be paid in each year from fiscal 2012 to 2016 are $49.8 million, $55.3 million, $61.1 million, $69.0 million and $76.9 million, respectively. The aggregate benefits expected to be paid in the five fiscal years from 2017 to 2021 are $543.9 million. The expected benefits to be paid are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Companys pension plans benefit obligations at June 30, 2011 and includes estimated future employee service. C. Retirement and Savings Plan. The Company has a 401(k) retirement and savings plan, which allows eligible employees to contribute up to 35% of their compensation annually and allows highly compensated employees to contribute up to 10% of their compensation annually. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions, which amounted to approximately $57.5 million, $55.8 million, and $52.1 million for the calendar years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. NOTE 15. INCOME TAXES Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes shown below are based on the geographic location to which such earnings are attributable. Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 2009 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes: United States $ 1,675.1 $ 1,638.0 $ 1,908.6 Foreign 257.6 225.2 (8.5 ) $ 1,932.7 $ 1,863.2 $ 1,900.1 The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following components: Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 2009 Current: Federal $ 449.3 $ 401.3 $ 708.9 Foreign 96.9 104.4 (121.2 ) State 24.7 54.1 35.2 Total current 570.9 559.8 622.9 Deferred: Federal 95.7 106.8 (63.3 ) Foreign (1.8 ) (15.1 ) 26.2 State 13.7 4.4 (10.8 ) Total deferred 107.6 96.1 (47.9 ) Total provision for income taxes $ 678.5 $ 655.9 $ 575.0 ` 64 A reconciliation between the Companys effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate is as follows: Years ended June 30, 2011 % 2010 % 2009 % Provision for taxes at U.S. statutory rate $ 676.5 35.0 $ 652.1 35.0 $ 665.0 35.0 Increase (decrease) in provision from: State taxes, net of federal tax 29.2 1.5 34.5 1.9 37.8 2.0 Tax on repatriated earnings and foreign income 30.3 1.6 15.1 0.8 43.0 2.2 Utilization of foreign tax credits (26.0 ) (1.3 ) (14.9 ) (0.8 ) (46.6 ) (2.4 ) Tax settlements (120.0 ) (6.3 ) Resolution of tax matters (12.2 ) (0.7 ) (2.8 ) (0.1 ) Section 199 Qualified Production Activities (18.2 ) (1.0 ) (11.8 ) (0.6 ) (6.9 ) (0.4 ) Other (13.3 ) (0.7 ) (6.9 ) (0.4 ) 5.5 0.3 $ 678.5 35.1 $ 655.9 35.2 $ 575.0 30.3 The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classifications are as follows: Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 Deferred tax assets: Accrued expenses not currently deductible $ 205.8 $ 227.4 Stock based compensation expense 95.7 100.9 Net operating losses 111.4 80.8 Other 10.8 3.0 423.7 412.1 Less: valuation allowances (62.7 ) (61.9 ) Deferred tax assets, net $ 361.0 $ 350.2 Deferred tax liabilities: Prepaid retirement benefits $ 97.7 $ 19.4 Deferred revenue 62.3 80.8 Fixed and intangible assets 298.9 176.3 Prepaid expenses 61.3 46.9 Unrealized investment gains, net 194.3 249.0 Tax on unrepatriated earnings 20.0 12.3 Other 0.4 Deferred tax liabilities $ 734.9 $ 584.7 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 373.9 $ 234.5 There are $35.2 million and $35.4 million of current deferred tax assets included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There are $62.3 million and $84.5 million of long term deferred tax assets included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There are $97.9 million, and $48.1 million of current deferred tax liabilities included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of approximately $1,016.7 million as of June 30, 2011, as the Company considers such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the United States. The additional U.S. income tax that would arise on repatriation of the remaining undistributed earnings could be offset, in part, by foreign tax credits on such repatriation. However, it is impractical to estimate the amount of net income tax that might be payable. 65 The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $123.0 million as of June 30, 2011, of which $30.9 million expires through 2031 and $92.1 million has an indefinite utilization period. As of June 30, 2011, the Company has approximately $95.7 million of federal net operating loss carry forwards from acquired companies. The net operating loss has an annual utilization limitation pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and expires through 2026. The Company has state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $259.8 million as of June 30, 2011, which expire through 2030. The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $62.7 million and $61.9 million at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to reflect the estimated amount of domestic and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized. Income tax payments were approximately $628.7 million, $693.4 million, and $719.1 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. As of June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $105.7 million, $107.2 million and $92.8 million respectively. The amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is $56.3 million, $52.8 million and $42.0 million respectively. The remainder, if recognized, would principally affect deferred taxes. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 107.2 $ 92.8 $ 404.2 Additions for tax positions 9.7 13.3 19.0 Reductions for tax positions (2.4 ) (2.1 ) (6.4 ) Additions for tax positions of prior periods 17.3 29.6 111.4 Reductions for tax positions of prior periods (23.3 ) (1.0 ) (207.7 ) Settlements with tax authorities (4.5 ) (5.0 ) (216.9 ) Expiration of the statute of limitations (0.4 ) (20.3 ) (3.5 ) Impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 2.1 (0.1 ) (7.3 ) Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 105.7 $ 107.2 $ 92.8 Interest expense and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions have been recorded in the provision for income taxes on the Statements of Consolidated Earnings. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recorded interest expense of $1.7 million, $4.0 million, and $15.5 million, respectively. Penalties incurred during fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were not material. At June 30, 2011, the Company had accrued interest of $15.4 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $0.4 million was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities. At June 30, 2010, the Company had accrued interest of $15.3 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $0.2 million was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities. At June 30, 2011, the Company had accrued penalties of $3.4 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $0.1 was recorded within income taxes payable, and the remainder was recorded within other liabilities. At June 30, 2010, the Company had accrued penalties of $1.1 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was recorded within other liabilities. 66 The Company is routinely examined by the IRS and tax authorities in foreign countries in which it conducts business, as well as tax authorities in states in which it has significant business operations. The tax years currently under examination vary by jurisdiction. Examinations in progress in which the Company has significant business operations are as follows: Taxing Jurisdiction Fiscal Years under Examination U.S. (IRS) 2009 2011 California 2006 2008 Illinois 2004 2005 New Jersey 2002 2008 France 2008 2009 Canada completed its joint audit with the Province of Ontario for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 through June 30, 2007 which did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments resulting from examinations in each of the jurisdictions. The resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Companys Statements of Consolidated Earnings for a particular future period and on the Companys effective tax rate. If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10.0 million in the next twelve months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. In January 2010, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS regarding all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for the tax years 2007 and 2008, which did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements of the Company. In June 2009, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS regarding all outstanding tax audit issues with the IRS in dispute for the tax years 1998 through 2006. As a result, the Company owed the IRS and other tax jurisdictions $217.5 million, which was satisfied by applying $113.2 million of funds on deposit and making cash payments of $103.0 million in fiscal 2010. The impact of this agreement was offset by a receivable of $168.1 million from the IRS and other tax jurisdictions, of which $152.3 million was received in fiscal 2010. The remaining balances are expected to be settled in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2009, the Company had previously recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $317.6 million and recorded a benefit to the provision for income taxes of $99.7 million. Additionally, in fiscal 2009, the Company included a cumulative adjustment between domestic and foreign earnings as a result of the audit settlement described above and a related agreement with a foreign tax authority, and as a result, included a foreign tax benefit of $119.7 million in its income tax provision. In April 2009, the Company settled a state tax matter, for which the Company had previously recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $14.2 million and a related deferred tax asset of $5.1 million. Accordingly, the Company recorded a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $9.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 related to the reversal of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and the related deferred tax asset. In addition, the Company received a tax credit of $11.1 million related to the same matter, which further reduced the provision for income taxes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. 67 NOTE 16. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has obligations under various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. Total expense under these agreements was approximately $159.2 million, $175.4 million, and $194.2 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, with minimum commitments at June 30, 2011 as follows: Years ending June 30, 2012 $ 131.0 2013 106.7 2014 80.6 2015 61.7 2016 29.2 Thereafter 31.3 $ 440.5 In addition to fixed rentals, certain leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. As of June 30, 2011, the Company has purchase commitments of approximately $520.8 million relating to software and equipment purchases and maintenance contracts, of which $194.6 million relates to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, $143.3 million relates to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 and the remaining $182.9 million relates to fiscal years ending June 30, 2014 through fiscal 2016. In September 2010, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. The lawsuit was subsequently removed to the United States District Court, Central District of California, Western Division. The complaint alleges that the Company unlawfully handled certain client calls and seeks statutory damages. The services at issue were performed by an independent third party vendor, and the Company believes that it has the contractual right to full indemnification from this vendor for any potential losses it might incur with respect to the matter. In April 2011, the Company and the third party vendor entered into a class action settlement agreement with the plaintiff to settle the matter subject to court approval. As part of the settlement, the Company was to be dismissed from the action, and the third party vendor will pay all settlement amounts. The third party vendor is also paying all of the Companys legal fees and costs associated with the defense of the matter. The Company was dismissed from the action on May 2, 2011. On July 20, 2011 the court granted preliminary approval to the class action settlement and provisionally certified the settlement class. A hearing on final approval is scheduled for November 28, 2011. On July 18, 2011, athenahealth, Inc. filed a complaint against ADP AdvancedMD, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company. The complaint alleges that ADP AdvancedMDs activities in providing medical practice management and billing and revenue management software and associated services to physicians and medical practice managers infringe two patents owned by athenahealth, Inc. The complaint seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, and costs. The Company is currently investigating the merits of the claims and intends to vigorously defend itself. In June of 2011, the Company received a Commissioners Charge from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that the Company has violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by refusing to recruit, hire, transfer and promote certain persons on the basis of their race, in the State of Illinois from at least the period of January 1, 2007 to the present. The Company is investigating the allegations set forth in the Commissioners Charge and intends to cooperate with the EEOCs investigation. The Company is subject to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the ultimate loss. At this time the Company is unable to estimate any possible loss, or range of possible loss, with respect to the matters described above. This is primarily because these matters are still in early stages and involve complex issues subject to inherent uncertainty. There can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in a manner that is not adverse to the Company. It is not the Companys business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Companys services and products. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties. 68 NOTE 17. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income is a measure of income that includes both net earnings and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) results from items deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in stockholders equity. Other comprehensive income (loss) was $157.6 million, $53.5 million, and $(120.2) million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The accumulated balances reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for each component of other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows: June 30, 2011 2010 2009 Currency translation adjustments $ 183.1 $ 16.4 $ 92.5 Unrealized net gain on available for sale securities, net of tax 369.8 457.8 282.4 Pension liability adjustment, net of tax (185.8 ) (264.7 ) (218.9 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income $ 367.1 $ 209.5 $ 156.0 NOTE 18. FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA Based upon similar economic characteristics and operational characteristics, the Companys strategic business units have been aggregated into the following three reportable segments: Employer Services, PEO Services and Dealer Services. The primary components of the Other segment are miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, non recurring gains and losses, results of operations of ADP Indemnity and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock based compensation expense. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are recorded based on management responsibility. The fiscal 2010 and 2009 reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal 2011 budgeted foreign exchange rates. In addition, there is a reconciling item for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. The reportable segments results also include an internal cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. All of these adjustments/charges are reconciling items to our reportable segments revenues and or earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and results in the elimination of these adjustments/charges in consolidation. Reportable segments assets include funds held for clients, but exclude corporate cash, corporate marketable securities and goodwill. 69 Reconciling Items Client Cost of Employer PEO Dealer Foreign Fund Capital Services Services Services Other Exchange Interest Charge Total Year ended June 30, 2011 Revenues from continuing operations $ 6,861.7 $ 1,543.9 $ 1,494.4 $ 12.9 $ 179.5 $ (212.9 ) $ $ 9,879.5 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 1,831.5 137.4 234.4 (191.1 ) 20.2 (212.9 ) 113.2 1,932.7 Assets from continuing operations 27,069.0 262.1 677.4 6,229.8 34,238.3 Capital expenditures for continuing operations 51.3 1.2 34.4 97.9 184.8 Depreciation and amortization 210.8 1.1 99.3 120.2 (113.2 ) 318.2 (a) Year ended June 30, 2010 Revenues from continuing operations $ 6,376.7 $ 1,316.8 $ 1,205.9 $ 18.4 $ 146.6 $ (136.7 ) $ $ 8,927.7 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 1,720.6 127.3 201.5 (173.1 ) 17.8 (136.7 ) 105.8 1,863.2 Assets from continuing operations 20,560.5 160.8 517.7 5,623.2 26,862.2 Capital expenditures for continuing operations 42.5 0.3 24.0 23.4 90.2 Depreciation and amortization 217.7 1.3 82.4 113.6 (105.8 ) 309.2 (a) Year ended June 30, 2009 Revenues from continuing operations $ 6,378.6 $ 1,185.8 $ 1,242.1 $ 19.5 $ 78.7 $ (66.3 ) $ $ 8,838.4 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 1,755.4 117.6 215.2 (233.2 ) 6.5 (66.3 ) 104.9 1,900.1 Assets from continuing operations 18,318.2 104.0 591.4 6,338.1 25,351.7 Capital expenditures for continuing operations 47.4 0.2 27.0 93.0 167.6 Depreciation and amortization 213.9 1.3 82.5 114.9 (104.9 ) 307.7 (a) (a) Includes $64.8 million, $70.6 million, and $70.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of depreciation and amortization that does not relate to our services and products. 70 Revenues and assets from continuing operations by geographic area are as follows: United States Europe Canada Other Total Year ended June 30, 2011 Revenues from continuing operations $ 7,930.3 $ 1,190.6 $ 428.2 $ 330.4 $ 9,879.5 Assets from continuing operations $ 29,294.8 $ 2,027.6 $ 2,497.6 $ 418.3 $ 34,238.3 Year ended June 30, 2010 Revenues from continuing operations $ 7,195.0 $ 1,089.8 $ 383.4 $ 259.5 $ 8,927.7 Assets from continuing operations $ 22,401.1 $ 1,576.8 $ 2,558.5 $ 325.8 $ 26,862.2 Year ended June 30, 2009 Revenues from continuing operations $ 7,222.8 $ 1,051.6 $ 343.4 $ 220.6 $ 8,838.4 Assets from continuing operations $ 21,577.8 $ 1,621.8 $ 1,851.8 $ 300.3 $ 25,351.7 NOTE 19.
