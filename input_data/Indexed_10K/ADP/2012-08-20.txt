EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW For more than 60 years, ADP has served as a trusted human resources, payroll, benefits, and integrated computing solutions partner to employers and automotive dealerships around the world. Our mission is to power organizations with insightful solutions that drive business success by delivering the best solutions to all of our markets ahead of the competition on a consistent basis. ADPs strengths have traditionally been in three core areas: a broad suite of products that deliver relief from administrative burdens; a strong service orientation; and strong sales and distribution. We have redefined our strategic pillars to align them with our goals which are predicated on driving innovation, service excellence and building talent. Our strategic pillars are to: Grow our integrated suite of cloud based Human Capital Management (HCM), benefits, and payroll solutions to serve the US market; Invest to grow and scale our market leading HR Business Process Outsourcing solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes; Leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM, benefits, and payroll solutions where they do business; and Grow and deepen our solutions offering to ensure our key adjacencies are market leaders. We believe the strategic pillars outlined above will help us build on our core competencies and develop new ones as we continue to focus on delivering stellar service to our clients, creating an environment that fosters innovation, positioning ADP as the global HCM market leader, and enhancing long term total shareholder return. During the year ended June 30, 2012 (fiscal 2012), we achieved solid results that reflect the strength and resilience of our underlying business model despite the challenges posed by the current economic environment. Our focus on product innovation and our investment in sales associate headcount has led to growth in new business sales and solid revenue retention across our business segments. We are pleased with the current performance of our strategic acquisitions together with the continued strength in our same store sales growth. However, we continue to be impacted by the decline in high margin client interest revenues as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance. We expect the lower interest rates to continue to impact us during the year ending June 30, 2013 (fiscal 2013). 18 Consolidated revenues in fiscal 2012 increased 8%, to $10,665.2 million, as compared to $9,879.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 (fiscal 2011). Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 10%, to $2,122.1 million, as compared to $1,932.7 million in fiscal 2011 and net earnings from continuing operations increased 11%, to $1,388.5 million, as compared to $1,254.2 million in fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 12%, to $2.82 in fiscal 2012, from $2.52 per share in fiscal 2011, on fewer shares outstanding. Our results for the year included a gain on the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third party expense management platform of $66.0 million, or $41.2 million after tax, which contributed to increasing our diluted EPS from continuing operations 3%, or $0.08 per share. Each of our business segments has continued to demonstrate core strength. Employer Services revenues increased 7% to $7,567.7 million, PEO Services revenues increased 15% to $1,771.4 million, and Dealer Services revenues increased 10% to $1,683.7 million in fiscal 2012. Our Employer Services pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same store sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, increased 3.0% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2012. Our worldwide client revenue retention rate remained strong throughout the year ending at 91%. Employer Services and PEO Services new business sales, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, grew 13% worldwide, to over $1.2 billion in fiscal 2012. Dealer Services new business sales showed strength as we continued to experience the effects of a stronger automotive industry and increased penetration of applications within our base. Consolidated interest on funds held for clients decreased approximately 9%, or $46.8 million, to $493.3 million from $540.1 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 2.8% in fiscal 2012 as compared to 3.2% in fiscal 2011, partially offset by growth in average client funds balances of 6% due to our positive Employer Services metrics. The safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification of our clients funds are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy. We continue to promote this strategy by investing in a prudent and conservative manner in accordance with our investment guidelines with a predominant focus on AAA/AA securities. We do not hold direct investments in sovereign debt issued by Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, or Spain. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. 19 Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2012, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1,665.4 million. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,910.2 million in fiscal 2012, as compared to $1,705.8 million in fiscal 2011. This increase in cash flows from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 was due to higher net earnings, lower pension plan contributions, and a favorable change in the net components of working capital, partially offset by a variance in the timing of tax related net cash payments. The increase in cash provided by investing activities of $10,584.2 million is due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations, the amount of cash used for business combinations and cash receipts related to the sale of property, plant and equipment and other assets. The increase in cash used in financing activities of $10,293.1 million is primarily due to the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, as compared to the prior year. We have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, excellent margins, the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements. We continue to enhance value to our shareholders, and in fiscal 2012 returned excess cash of $739.7 million through dividends and $741.3 million through our share buyback program, while also investing $265.7 million in new acquisitions. In the last five fiscal years, we have reduced the Companys common stock outstanding by approximately 10% through share buybacks, net of the effect of common stock issued under employee stock based compensation programs. We have also raised the dividend payout per share for 37 consecutive years. 20 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, 2012 2011 $ Change % Change Total revenues $ 10,665.2 $ 9,879.5 $ 785.7 8 % Costs of revenues: Operating expenses 5,380.1 4,900.9 479.2 10 % Systems development and programming costs 599.9 577.2 22.7 4 % Depreciation and amortization 260.0 253.4 6.6 3 % Total costs of revenues 6,240.0 5,731.5 508.5 9 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,466.2 2,323.3 142.9 6 % Interest expense 7.7 8.6 (0.9 ) (10 %) Total expenses 8,713.9 8,063.4 650.5 8 % Other income, net (170.8 ) (116.6 ) 54.2 46 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 2,122.1 $ 1,932.7 $ 189.4 10 % Margin 19.9 % 19.6 % Provision for income taxes $ 733.6 $ 678.5 $ 55.1 8 % Effective tax rate 34.6 % 35.1 % Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,388.5 $ 1,254.2 $ 134.3 11 % Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.82 $ 2.52 $ 0.30 12 % Total Revenues Our total revenues increased $785.7 million, or 8%, to $10,665.2 million in fiscal 2012, from $9,879.5 million in fiscal 2011, due to an increase in revenues in Employer Services of 7%, or $524.8 million, to $7,567.7 million, PEO Services of 15%, or $227.5 million, to $1,771.4 million, and Dealer Services of 10%, or $147.7 million, to $1,683.7 million. Total revenues would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of recently completed acquisitions and the impact to revenues pertaining to the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third party expense management platform. There was no impact to total revenue growth rates as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Total revenues for fiscal 2012 include interest on funds held for clients of $493.3 million, as compared to $540.1 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 2.8% during fiscal 2012 as compared to 3.2% for fiscal 2011, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance of 6%, to $17.9 billion in fiscal 2012. Total Expenses Our total expenses increased $650.5 million, or 8%, to $8,713.9 million in fiscal 2012, from $8,063.4 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in our consolidated expenses was due to an increase in operating expenses of $479.2 million, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $142.9 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $22.7 million. Total expenses would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of recently completed acquisitions. 21 Our total costs of revenues increased 9%, to $6,240.0 million in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011 due to an increase in operating expenses of $479.2 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $22.7 million. Operating expenses increased $479.2 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO Services, which has pass through costs that are re billable and which includes costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. These pass through costs were $1,363.6 million in fiscal 2012, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,060.3 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $303.3 million. These pass through costs were $1,182.2 million in fiscal 2011, which included costs for benefits coverage of $937.8 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $244.4 million. The increase in operating expenses is also due to operating expenses related to businesses acquired of $132.1 million, and higher labor related expenses in Employer Services of $38.5 million. Additionally, operating expenses decreased $5.4 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Systems development and programming costs increased $22.7 million, or 4%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, due to businesses acquired of $16.1 million, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalizable efforts directed at feature and functionality product enhancements in the period. Additionally, systems, development and programming costs decreased $1.3 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $142.9 million, or 6%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in expenses was related to severance expenses of $51.2 million resulting from cost reduction initiatives focused on the realization of synergies in certain international businesses as we adjust our cost structure in light of the softer European economic environment, an increase in selling expenses of $55.5 million resulting from increases in sales force headcount coupled with an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of acquired businesses of $36.7 million. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $9.0 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Other Income, net Years ended June 30, 2012 2011 $ Change (Dollars in millions) Interest income on corporate funds $ (85.2 ) $ (88.8 ) $ (3.6 ) Realized gains on available for sale securities (32.1 ) (38.0 ) (5.9 ) Realized losses on available for sale securities 7.7 3.6 (4.1 ) Realized gains on investment in Reserve Fund (0.9 ) (0.9 ) Impairment losses on available for sale securities 5.8 (5.8 ) Impairment losses on assets held for sale 2.2 11.7 9.5 Gain on sale of assets (66.0 ) 66.0 Net gains on sales of buildings (1.8 ) (1.8 ) Other, net (3.2 ) (2.4 ) 0.8 Other income, net $ (170.8 ) $ (116.6 ) $ 54.2 Other income, net, increased $54.2 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. This increase was due to a gain of $66.0 million pertaining to the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third party expense management platform during fiscal 2012. This increase was partially offset by the net activity related to our available for sale securities, including realized gains, realized losses and impairment losses, which together resulted in a decrease in other income, net of $15.8 million, and a decrease in interest income on corporate funds of $3.6 million during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease in interest income on corporate funds resulted from lower average interest rates from 2.6% for fiscal 2011 to 2.1% for fiscal 2012, partially offset by increasing average daily corporate funds, which increased from $3.5 billion for fiscal 2011 to $4.0 billion for fiscal 2012. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed the sale of two buildings previously classified as assets held for sale for their combined carrying value of $6.9 million, net of selling costs. We had previously recorded impairment charges related to these two buildings of $2.2 million and $11.7 million during fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. 22 Earnings from continuing operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $189.4 million, or 10%, from $1,932.7 million in fiscal 2011 to $2,122.1 million in fiscal 2012 due to the increase in revenues and the gain on sale of assets, partially offset by the increase in expenses discussed above. Overall margin increased approximately 30 basis points in fiscal 2012 with approximately 60 basis points of the margin contribution related to the gain on the sale of assets and approximately 40 basis points of margin decline attributable to acquisitions. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were 34.6% and 35.1%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year is the result of the final resolution of certain tax matters, the expiration of certain statutes of limitation, and the availability of foreign tax credits, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of earnings between jurisdictions. Net Earnings from continuing operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from continuing operations Net earnings from continuing operations increased $134.3 million, or 11%, from $1,254.2 million in fiscal 2011 to $1,388.5 million in fiscal 2012 and includes an after tax gain on sale of assets of $41.2 million. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 12%, to $2.82 compared from $2.52 in fiscal 2011. The increase in diluted earnings per share reflects the increase in net earnings and the impact of fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of approximately 14.6 million shares during fiscal 2012 and the repurchase of 14.2 million shares in fiscal 2011. The following table reconciles our results for fiscal 2012 to adjusted results that exclude the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third party expense management platform. We use certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by us and improves our ability to understand our operating performance. Since adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, earnings from continuing operations, and diluted EPS from continuing operations and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Although we have presented our results for fiscal 2012 adjusted to exclude the gain on the sale of assets discussed above, we do not expect this sale of assets to have a material impact on the results of our future operations. 23 Year ended June 30, 2012 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Diluted EPS Earnings from Net earnings from from continuing operations Provision for continuing continuing before income taxes income taxes operations operations As Reported $ 2,122.1 $ 733.6 $ 1,388.5 $ 2.82 Less Adjustment: Gain on sale of assets 66.0 24.8 41.2 0.08 As Adjusted $ 2,056.1 $ 708.8 $ 1,347.3 $ 2.74 Net earnings from continuing operations, as adjusted, increased $93.1 million, or 7% to $1,347.3 million, for fiscal 2012, from $1,254.2 million, as reported, for fiscal 2011, and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, increased 9%, to $2.74 for fiscal 2012. The increase in diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of approximately 14.6 million shares during fiscal 2012 and the repurchase of 14.2 million shares in fiscal 2011. 24 Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change Total revenues $ 9,879.5 $ 8,927.7 $ 951.8 11 % Costs of revenues: Operating expenses 4,900.9 4,277.2 623.7 15 % Systems development and programming costs 577.2 513.9 63.3 12 % Depreciation and amortization 253.4 238.6 14.8 6 % Total costs of revenues 5,731.5 5,029.7 701.8 14 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,323.3 2,127.4 195.9 9 % Interest expense 8.6 8.6 Total expenses 8,063.4 7,165.7 897.7 13 % Other income, net (116.6 ) (101.2 ) 15.4 15 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,932.7 $ 1,863.2 $ 69.5 4 % Margin 19.6 % 20.9 % Provision for income taxes $ 678.5 $ 655.9 $ 22.6 3 % Effective tax rate 35.1 % 35.2 % Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,254.2 $ 1,207.3 $ 46.9 4 % Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.52 $ 2.40 $ 0.12 5 % Total RevenuesOur total revenues increased 11% to $9,879.5 million in fiscal 2011, from $8,927.7 million in fiscal 2010, due to an increase in revenues in Employer Services of 8%, or $507.8 million, to $7,042.9 million, PEO Services of 17%, or $227.1 million, to $1,543.9 million, and Dealer Services of 23%, or $287.9 million, to $1,536.0 million. Total revenue would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of acquisitions. There was no impact to total revenue growth rates as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Total revenues for fiscal 2011 include interest on funds held for clients of $540.1 million, as compared to $542.8 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 3.2% during fiscal 2011 as compared to 3.6% for fiscal 2010, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance of 11%, to $16.9 billion in fiscal 2011. Total ExpensesOur total expenses in fiscal 2011 increased $897.7 million, to $8,063.4 million, from $7,165.7 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in our consolidated expenses was due to an increase in operating expenses of $623.7 million, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $195.9 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $63.3 million. Our total costs of revenues increased 14%, to $5,731.5 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010 due to an increase in operating expenses of $623.7 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $63.3 million. 25 Operating expenses increased $623.7 million, or 15%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO Services, which has pass through costs that are re billable and which includes costs for benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. These pass through costs were $1,182.2 million in fiscal 2011, which included costs for benefits coverage of $937.8 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $244.4 million. These pass through costs were $988.5 million in fiscal 2010, which included costs for benefits coverage of $811.5 million and costs for workers compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $176.9 million. The increase in operating expenses is also due to operating expenses related to businesses acquired of $230.6 million, and higher expenses in Employer Services of $47.4 million related to increased service costs for investment in client facing associates. Additionally, operating expenses increased due to the settlement of a PEO Services state unemployment matter that reduced operating expenses $9.2 million in fiscal 2010. Lastly, operating expenses increased $5.6 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Systems development and programming costs increased $63.3 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, due to expenses of acquired businesses of $42.2 million and higher development expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $195.9 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in expenses was due to higher selling expenses of $75.6 million resulting from increases in headcount over prior year levels coupled with an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of acquired businesses of $96.1 million, an increase in stock based compensation expense of $5.9 million, and an increase in technology related security expenses of $8.1 million. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.6 million due to changes in foreign currency rates. Other Income, net Years ended June 30, 2011 2010 $ Change (Dollars in millions) Interest income on corporate funds $ (88.8 ) $ (98.8 ) $ (10.0 ) Realized gains on available for sale securities (38.0 ) (15.0 ) 23.0 Realized losses on available for sale securities 3.6 13.4 9.8 Realized gains on investment in Reserve Fund (0.9 ) (15.2 ) (14.3 ) Impairment losses on available for sale securities 14.4 14.4 Impairment losses on assets held for sale 11.7 (11.7 ) Net loss (gain) on sales of buildings (1.8 ) 2.3 4.1 Other, net (2.4 ) (2.3 ) 0.1 Other income, net $ (116.6 ) $ (101.2 ) $ 15.4 Other income, net, increased $15.4 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was mainly due to an increase in realized gains on available for sale securities of $23.0 million, and a decrease in realized losses on available for sale securities of $9.8 million, which together increased other income, net, $32.8 million. Such amounts were offset in fiscal 2011 by an $11.7 million impairment loss on assets held for sale and a $10.0 million decrease in interest income on corporate funds resulting from flat average interest rates at 2.6%, as compared to the prior year, coupled with declining average daily corporate funds, which decreased from $3.8 billion in fiscal 2010 to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2011. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $69.5 million, or 4%, from $1,863.2 million in fiscal 2010 to $1,932.7 million in fiscal 2011 due to the increase in revenues partially offset by the increase in expenses discussed above. Overall margin decreased approximately 130 basis points in fiscal 2011 with approximately 90 basis points of the margin decline attributable to acquisitions. 26 Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were 35.1% and 35.2%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 is due to the resolution of certain tax matters in fiscal 2010 that resulted in a decrease to the effective tax rate of 0.7 percentage points for that period, offset by a decrease in federal and state income tax expense and a favorable mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions in fiscal 2011. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing OperationsNet earnings from continuing operations increased $46.9 million to $1,254.2 million in fiscal 2011, from $1,207.3 million in fiscal 2010, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5%, to $2.52. The increase in net earnings in fiscal 2011 reflects the increase in earnings before income taxes and the impact of the tax matters discussed above. The increase in diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 reflects the increase in earnings and the impact of the tax matters discussed above coupled with the effects of fewer shares outstanding. The following table reconciles our results for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to adjusted results that exclude the impact of certain favorable tax items. We use certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by us and improves our ability to understand our operating performance. Since adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 27 Year ended June 30, 2011 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Diluted EPS Earnings from Net earnings from from continuing operations Provision for continuing continuing before income taxes income taxes operations operations As Reported $ 1,932.7 $ 678.5 $ 1,254.2 $ 2.52 Less Adjustment: Favorable tax items As Adjusted $ 1,932.7 $ 678.5 $ 1,254.2 $ 2.52 Year ended June 30, 2010 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Diluted EPS Earnings from Net earnings from from continuing operations Provision for continuing continuing before income taxes income taxes operations operations As Reported $ 1,863.2 $ 655.9 $ 1,207.3 $ 2.40 Less Adjustment: Favorable tax items 12.2 12.2 0.02 As Adjusted $ 1,863.2 $ 668.1 $ 1,195.1 $ 2.37 Net earnings from continuing operations, as adjusted, increased $59.1 million to $1,254.2 million for fiscal 2011, from $1,195.1 million for fiscal 2010, and the related diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, increased $0.15 to $2.52. The increase in diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the fiscal 2011 reflects the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the repurchase of approximately 14.2 million shares during fiscal 2011 and the repurchase of 18.2 million shares in fiscal 2010. 28 ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Revenues (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2012 2011 Employer Services $ 7,567.7 $ 7,042.9 $ 6,535.1 $ 524.8 $ 507.8 7 % 8 % PEO Services 1,771.4 1,543.9 1,316.8 227.5 227.1 15 % 17 % Dealer Services 1,683.7 1,536.0 1,248.1 147.7 287.9 10 % 23 % Other 5.5 12.8 18.5 (7.3 ) (5.7 ) Reconciling items: Foreign exchange (55.9 ) (43.2 ) (54.1 ) Client funds interest (307.2 ) (212.9 ) (136.7 ) Total revenues $ 10,665.2 $ 9,879.5 $ 8,927.7 $ 785.7 $ 951.8 8 % 11 % Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2012 2011 Employer Services $ 1,972.3 $ 1,856.5 $ 1,741.4 $ 115.8 $ 115.1 6 % 7 % PEO Services 170.2 137.3 127.2 32.9 10.1 24 % 8 % Dealer Services 277.1 233.3 204.1 43.8 29.2 19 % 14 % Other (117.6 ) (191.9 ) (173.9 ) 74.3 (18.0 ) Reconciling items: Foreign exchange 2.7 (6.5 ) (8.9 ) Client funds interest (307.2 ) (212.9 ) (136.7 ) Cost of capital charge 124.6 116.9 110.0 Total earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 2,122.1 $ 1,932.7 $ 1,863.2 $ 189.4 $ 69.5 10 % 4 % The fiscal 2011 and 2010 reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal 2012 budgeted foreign exchange rates. This adjustment is made for management purposes so that the reportable segments revenues are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This adjustment is a reconciling item to revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and is eliminated in consolidation. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are charged to the reportable segments based on managements responsibility for the applicable costs. The primary components of the Other segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity (a wholly owned captive insurance company that provides workers compensation and employers liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees), non recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock based compensation expense. In addition, the reconciling items include an adjustment for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services and PEO Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. This allocation is made for management reasons so that the reportable segments results are presented on a consistent basis without the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. This allocation is a reconciling item to our reportable segments revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and is eliminated in consolidation. 29 Finally, the reportable segments results also include a cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. This charge is a reconciling item to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and is eliminated in consolidation. Employer Services Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 RevenuesEmployer Services revenues increased $524.8 million, or 7%, to $7,567.7 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Revenues for our Employer Services business would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of acquisitions and revenues pertaining to the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third party expense management platform. Revenues increased due to new business started during the year from new business sales growth, an increase in the number of employees on our clients payrolls, and the impact of price increases. Our worldwide client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2012 decreased slightly as compared to our rate for fiscal 2011. Pays per control, which represents the number of employees on our clients payrolls as measured on a same store sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions, increased 3.0% for fiscal 2012. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEmployer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $115.8 million, or 6%, to $1,972.3 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was due to the increase in revenues of $524.8 million discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $409.0 million. In addition to an increase in expenses related to increased revenues, expenses increased for fiscal 2012 due to increases in sales headcount and labor related costs over the same period prior year levels coupled with the effects of acquisitions. Overall margin decreased approximately 30 basis points from 26.4% to 26.1% for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, with approximately 80 basis points of margin decline attributable to acquisitions. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenues Employer Services revenues increased $507.8 million, or 8%, to $7,042.9 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Revenues for our Employer Services business would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of acquisitions. Revenues increased due to new business started during the year from new business sales growth, an increase in the number of employees on our clients payrolls, and higher average client funds balances. Our worldwide client revenue retention rate increased 120 basis points in fiscal 2011 to 91.1% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2010 and our pays per control increased 2.4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to our rate for fiscal 2010. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEmployer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $115.1 million to $1,856.5 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was due to the increase in revenues of $507.8 million discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $392.7 million. In addition to an increase in expenses related to increased revenues, expenses increased in fiscal 2011 due to increases in sales and service headcount over fiscal 2010 levels coupled with the effects of acquisitions. Overall margin decreased approximately 20 basis points from 26.6% to 26.4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, with approximately 110 basis points of margin decline attributable to acquisitions. 30 PEO Services Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 RevenuesPEO Services revenues increased $227.5 million, or 15%, to $1,771.4 million in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. Such revenues include pass through costs of $1,363.6 million for fiscal 2012 and $1,182.2 million for fiscal 2011 associated with benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. The increase in revenues was due to a 12% increase in the average number of worksite employees, resulting from an increase in the number of new clients and growth in our existing clients. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesPEO Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $32.9 million, or 24%, to $170.2 million for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011 due to growth in earnings related to the increase in the average number of worksite employees. Overall margin increased approximately 70 basis points to 9.6% for fiscal 2012 from 8.9% for fiscal 2011 resulting from a higher average number of worksite employees. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 RevenuesPEO Services revenues increased $227.1 million, or 17%, to $1,543.9 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. Such revenues include pass through costs of $1,182.2 million for fiscal 2011 and $988.5 million for fiscal 2010 associated with benefits coverage, workers compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. The increase in revenues was due to a 12% increase in the average number of worksite employees, resulting from an increase in the number of new clients and growth in our existing clients. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesPEO Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $10.1 million, or 8%, to $137.3 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to growth in earnings related to the increase in the number of average worksite employees. The increase was partially offset by the settlement of a state unemployment tax matter, which increased earnings before income taxes $9.2 million in fiscal 2010. Overall margin decreased to 8.9% in fiscal 2011 from 9.7% in fiscal 2010 due to a 70 basis point decline pertaining to the settlement of a fiscal 2010 state unemployment tax matter. Dealer Services Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 RevenuesDealer Services revenues increased $147.7 million, or 10%, to $1,683.7 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Revenues for our Dealer Services business would have increased approximately 6% for fiscal 2012 without the impact of acquisitions. Revenues without acquisitions increased $90.9 million due to new clients, improved client retention, and growth in our key products during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. The growth in our key products included increased users of our dealership front office solutions (including our customer relationship management ("CRM") applications and services), growth in our "Drive" dealer management system ("DMS") solution and hosted IP telephony services, and an increase in credit report and vehicle registration transaction revenues and increased activity in our digital marketing solutions and data services businesses. 31 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesDealer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $43.8 million, or 19%, to $277.1 million fiscal 2012, as compared to the fiscal 2011. The increase was due to the increase in revenues of $147.7 million discussed above and was partially offset by higher operating expenses related to implementing and servicing new clients and products. Overall margin increased approximately 130 basis points from 15.2% to 16.5% for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011 which includes approximately 20 basis points of margin decrease related to acquisitions. In addition, overall margin increased approximately 50 basis points due to acquisition related costs incurred during fiscal 2011 related to our acquisition of Cobalt in the prior year. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 RevenuesDealer Services revenues increased $287.9 million, or 23%, to $1,536.0 million in fiscal 2011. Revenues for our Dealer Services business would have increased approximately 3% for fiscal 2011 without the impact of acquisitions, which increased revenues $250.7 million. Revenues increased $37.8 million due to new clients, improved client retention, and growth in our key products. The growth in our key products was driven by increased users of application service provider (ASP) managed services, CRM solutions and growth in hosted IP telephony as well as an increase in transaction revenues due to higher credit report checks and vehicle registrations. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesDealer Services earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $29.2 million, or 14%, to $233.3 million in fiscal 2011. The increase was due to the increase in revenues of $287.9 million discussed above and was partially offset by higher operating expenses related to implementing and servicing new clients and products. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes also increased due to an asset impairment charge of $6.8 million recorded in fiscal 2010 resulting from the announcement by GM that it would shut down its Saturn division. Overall margin decreased from 16.4% to 15.2% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, which includes approximately 240 basis points of margin decline related to acquisitions, partially offset by the prior year effects of the Saturn impairment charge. OtherThe primary components of the Other segment are the results of operations of ADP Indemnity, non recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, such as customer financing transactions, and certain expenses that have not been charged to the reportable segments, such as stock based compensation expense. Stock based compensation expense was $78.7 million, $76.3 million, and $67.6 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. ADP Indemnity provides workers compensation and employers liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services worksite employees up to a $1 million per occurrence retention. PEO Services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss insurance from a wholly owned and regulated insurance carrier of AIG that covers all losses in excess of the $1 million per occurrence retention and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in each policy year. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO Services business. Premiums are charged to PEO Services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the PEO Services worksite employees. Changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by ADP Indemnity. Our net (gains) and losses on the sale of available for sale securities, including impairment losses, were $(18.6) million, $(34.4) million and $12.8 million in each of fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. 32 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At June 30, 2012, cash and marketable securities were $1,665.4 million, stockholders equity was $6,114.0 million, and the ratio of long term debt to equity was 0.3%. Working capital before funds held for clients and client funds obligations was $1,233.3 million, as compared to $1,252.2 million at June 30, 2011. The change in working capital compared to the prior fiscal year 2011 resulted from an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, an increase in accrued payroll and payroll related expenses, and an increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Our principal sources of liquidity for operations are derived from cash generated through operations and through corporate cash and marketable securities on hand. We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during fiscal 2012, and we held approximately $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2012. We also have the ability to generate cash through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short term commercial paper program and our U.S. and Canadian short term reverse repurchase agreements to meet short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Of the cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held at June 30, 2012, approximately $0.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries, if repatriated to the U.S., would generally be subject to foreign withholding and U.S. income taxes, adjusted for foreign tax credits. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our United States operations. Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,910.2 million for fiscal 2012, as compared to $1,705.8 million for fiscal 2011. The increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was due to higher net earnings, lower pension plan contributions of $66.5 million and a favorable change in the net components of working capital, partially offset by a variance in the timing of tax related net cash payments of $162.7 million. Net cash flows provided by investing activities were $3,243.6 million for fiscal 2012, as compared to net cash flows used in investing activities of $7,340.6 million fiscal 2011. The net increase in cash provided by investing activities was due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $9,692.1 million, a decrease of $510.3 million related to cash used for business acquisitions, and an increase of $58.5 million in cash receipts related to the sale of property, plant and equipment and other assets. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $4,953.9 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $5,339.2 million for fiscal 2011. The increase in cash used was due to the net change in client funds obligations of $10,017.5 million as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds and lower proceeds received from our stock purchase plan and the exercises of stock options. We purchased approximately 14.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $51.26 during fiscal 2012 compared to purchases of 14.2 million shares at an average price per share of $51.52 fiscal 2011. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions. Our U.S. short term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained through a short term commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $6.75 billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program is rated A 1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime 1 by Moodys. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. For fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, the Companys average borrowings were $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. The weighted average maturity of the Companys commercial paper approximated two days in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. We have successfully borrowed through the use of our commercial paper program on an as needed basis to meet short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. At June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011 we had no outstanding obligations under our short term commercial paper program. 33 Our U.S. and Canadian short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have $3.0 billion available to us on a committed basis under these reverse repurchase agreements. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the committed reverse repurchase agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $3.0 billion available to us under the committed reverse repurchase agreements. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $297.7 million and $505.2 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. At June 30, 2012 and 2011 we had no outstanding obligations under reverse repurchase agreements. We have a $2.0 billion, 364 day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in June 2013. In addition, we have a four year $3.25 billion credit facility maturing in June 2015 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. We also have a $1.5 billion five year credit facility that matures in June 2017 that also contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500.0 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to LIBOR, the federal funds effective rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through June 30, 2012 under the credit agreements. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $6.75 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset backed securities with underlying collateral of subprime mortgages, alternative A mortgages, sub prime auto loans or sub prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, asset backed commercial paper, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non investment grade fixed income securities. Furthermore, we do not hold direct investments in sovereign debt issued by Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, or Spain. We own AAA rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, rate reduction and auto loan receivables, secured predominately by prime collateral. All collateral on asset backed securities is performing as expected. In addition, we own senior debt directly issued by Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Farm Credit Banks, Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"). We do not own subordinated debt, preferred stock or common stock of any of these agencies. We do own mortgage backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages. These securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15 year and 30 year residential mortgages and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. 34 Capital expenditures for continuing operations in fiscal 2012 were $146.2 million, as compared to $184.8 million in fiscal 2011 and $90.2 million in fiscal 2010. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 related to our data center and other facility improvements were made to support our operations. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 to be between $160 million and $180 million. The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2012: (In millions) Payments due by period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations 1 year years years 5 years Unknown Total Debt Obligations (1) $ 17.5 $ 4.6 $ 5.1 $ 7.8 $ $ 35.0 Operating Lease and Software License Obligations (2) $ 173.7 $ 217.9 $ 70.4 $ 26.6 $ $ 488.6 Purchase Obligations (3) $ 350.5 $ 264.0 $ 183.4 $ $ $ 797.9 Obligations related to Unrecognized $ 7.0 $ $ $ $ 77.7 $ 84.7 Tax Benefits (4) Other long term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets: Compensation and Benefits (5) $ 78.7 $ 153.1 $ 94.1 $ 216.2 $ 33.6 $ 575.7 Acquisition related obligations (6) $ 14.8 $ 13.5 $ $ $ $ 28.3 Total $ 642.2 $ 653.1 $ 353.0 $ 250.6 $ 111.3 $ 2,010.2 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated interest payments due by corresponding period above are $0.8 million, $1.5 million, $1.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, which have been excluded. (2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment and other assets. (4) We made the determination that net cash payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months, related to unrecognized tax benefits of $84.7 million at June 30, 2012, are expected to be up to $7 million. We are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period beyond the next 12 months in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid. (5) Compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. (6) Acquisition related obligations relate to contingent consideration for business acquisitions for which the amount of contingent consideration was determinable at the date of acquisition and therefore included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a liability. In addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2012, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2013, total $20,856.2 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $21,539.1 million of cash and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2012. 35 ADP Indemnity provides workers compensation and employers liability deductible reimbursement protection for PEO Services worksite employees up to a $1 million per occurrence retention. PEO Services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss insurance from a select wholly owned and regulated insurance carrier of AIG that covers all losses in excess of the $1 million per occurrence retention and also any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in each policy year. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the PEO business. Premiums are charged to the PEO to cover the PEO Services worksite employee expected claim expenses. Changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by ADP Indemnity, Inc. At June 30, 2012, ADP Indemnitys total assets were $320.9 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated cost of workers compensation claims of $239.1 million for the policy years since July 1, 2003. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, ADP Indemnity paid claims of $64.1 million and $63.3 million, respectively. Should AIG and its wholly owned insurance company be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations, ADP would become responsible for satisfying the worksite employee workers compensation obligations. In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities, and long term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees). Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment grade marketable securities. These assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short term and long term fixed income securities are classified as available for sale securities. Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals. Consistent with those goals, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment grade marketable securities with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents. At June 30, 2012, approximately 92% of the available for sale securities categorized as U.S. Treasury and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies were invested in senior, unsecured, non callable debt directly issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Farm Credit Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short term financing arrangements to satisfy our short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously collected client funds that have already been invested in available for sale securities. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such clients obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the clients funds in advance of the timing of payment of such clients obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations. 36 There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available for sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $6.75 billion commercial paper program (rated A 1+ by Standard and Poors and Prime 1 (P1) by Moodys, the highest possible credit rating), our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions ($3.0 billion of which is available on a committed basis) and available borrowings under our $6.75 billion committed revolving credit facilities. However, the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below. We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB rated securities is 5 years, for single A rated securities is 7 years, and for AA rated and AAA rated securities is 10 years. Commercial paper and time deposits must be rated A1/P1. Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Years ended June 30, 2012 2011 2010 Average investment balances at cost: Corporate investments $ 4,024.6 $ 3,467.6 $ 3,839.2 Funds held for clients 17,898.2 16,865.4 15,194.5 Total $ 21,922.8 $ 20,333.0 $ 19,033.7 Average interest rates earned exclusive of realized gains/(losses) on: Corporate investments 2.1 % 2.6 % 2.6 % Funds held for clients 2.8 % 3.2 % 3.6 % Total 2.6 % 3.1 % 3.4 % Realized gains on available for sale securities $ 32.1 $ 38.0 $ 15.0 Realized losses on available for sale securities (7.7 ) (3.6 ) (13.4 ) Net realized gains on available for sale securities $ 24.4 $ 34.4 $ 1.6 Impairment losses on available for sale securities $ (5.8 ) $ $ (14.4 ) As of June 30: Net unrealized pre tax gains on available for sale securities $ 710.5 $ 570.9 $ 710.9 Total available for sale securities at fair value $ 18,093.4 $ 16,927.5 $ 15,517.0 We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short term and long term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decreased 50 basis points, from 3.1% for fiscal 2011 to 2.6% for fiscal 2012. A hypothetical change in both short term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a $10 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve month period ending June 30, 2013. A hypothetical change in only short term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short term investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a $5 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve month period ending June 30, 2013. 37 We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment grade securities, primarily AAA and AA rated securities, as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors, and for Canadian securities, Dominion Bond Rating Service. At June 30, 2012, approximately 84% of our available for sale securities held an AAA or AA rating. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. and Canadian government or government agency securities (and securities carrying their guarantee). We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. During fiscal 2010, we were exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. Dollar denominated short term intercompany amounts payable by a Canadian subsidiary to a U.S. subsidiary of the Company in the amount of $178.6 million U.S. Dollars. In order to manage the exposure related to the foreign exchange fluctuations between the Canadian Dollar and the U.S. Dollar, the Canadian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange forward contract, which obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $178.6 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1.15 Canadian Dollars to each U.S. Dollar on December 1, 2009. Upon settlement of such contract on December 1, 2009, an additional foreign exchange forward contract was entered into that obligated the Canadian subsidiary to buy $29.4 million U.S. Dollars at a rate of 1.06 Canadian dollars to each U.S. Dollar on February 26, 2010. The net loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts of $15.8 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010 was recognized in earnings in fiscal 2010 and substantially offset the foreign currency mark to market gains on the related short term intercompany amounts payable. The short term intercompany amounts payable were fully paid by the Canadian subsidiary to the U.S. subsidiary by February 2010. There were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2012, 2011, or 2010. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In January 2012, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011 03, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements. ASU 2011 03 revises the criteria for assessing effective control for repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity. The determination of whether the transfer of a financial asset subject to a repurchase agreement is a sale is based, in part, on whether the entity maintains effective control over the financial asset. ASU 2011 03 removes from the assessment of effective control: the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial asset on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and the related requirement to demonstrate that the transferor possesses adequate collateral to fund substantially all the cost of purchasing replacement financial assets. The adoption of ASU 2011 03 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 38 In January 2012, we adopted ASU 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. ASU 2011 04 requires expansion of the disclosures required for Level 3 measurements of fair value and provides updates to the existing measurement guidance. The adoption of ASU 2011 04 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU 2011 05 requires entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. ASU 2011 05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011 05 will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. ASU 2011 08 amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350 20 on testing goodwill for impairment. ASU 2011 08 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based upon the qualitative assessment, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test. ASU 2011 08 does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units, nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment. ASU 2011 08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011 08 will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., Employer Services payroll processing fees) as well as investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other Employer Services client related funds. We enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). Fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties. Interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. We also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses (e.g., Dealer Services dealer management systems). For a majority of our software sales arrangements, which provide hardware, software licenses, installation, and post contract customer support, revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term, as vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition. 39 We assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. We do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. Goodwill. We account for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in accordance with ASC 350 10, which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. We perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount. If an indicator of impairment exists based upon comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount, we would then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach, which combines the income approach, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital; and the market approach, which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. We had $3,155.3 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2012. Based on the fair value analysis completed in the fourth quarter of 2012, management concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. In completing the annual impairment test for fiscal 2012, we evaluated the reasonableness of differences noted between the fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth, synergies and or cost savings associated with our acquisitions. Income Taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. There is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Specifically, the likelihood of an entitys tax benefits being sustained must be more likely than not assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. As of June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Companys liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $84.7 million and $105.7 million, respectively. If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Based on current estimates, settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $10 million in the next twelve months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. 40 Stock Based Compensation. We measure stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. Item 7A.
