Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Results Introduction On August 17, 2006, Autodesk, Inc. (Autodesk or the Company) announced that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors was conducting a voluntary review of Autodesks historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues. On February 27, 2007, Autodesk announced the key results of the voluntary review, which were set forth in the Form 8 K filed on that date. The Audit Committee engaged independent outside legal counsel, Hogan & Hartson LLP, who, with the assistance of forensic accounting experts, PricewaterhouseCoopers, reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding approximately 230 separate stock option grant approvals made between January 1988 and August 2006, or the relevant period. During the course of the voluntary review, more than 700,000 documents were reviewed and interviews with over 40 current and former employees, directors and advisors were conducted. In February 2007, the Audit Committee completed its review and presented its final report to Autodesks Board of Directors. The following is a summary of the key findings of the Audit Committee: Throughout the relevant period, numerous administrative errors were made in the processing of option grants resulting in options being accounted for incorrectly; Between July 2000 and February 2005, the Company made monthly broad based employee grants pursuant to authority delegated by the Board to the CEO, where the grant dates for most of these broad based grants were selected by an administrative process to coincide with low trading prices during the month of the applicable grant; During the calendar year 1992: a broad based employee grant that included a grant to the Companys then CFO and then General Counsel were measured on an incorrect date; and the new hire grant to the then incoming CEO was measured on an incorrect date; There was no evidence that any officer or director backdated any stock option granted to himself or herself; Based on the evidence developed during the review, the Audit Committee concluded that it was unlikely that those involved in the decisions and actions that resulted in measurement date errors understood the accounting impact of their actions or that they intended to misstate our financial statements; and 33 Table of Contents There was no evidence of any measurement date error involving any stock option grant made to a person serving as a director. The Company had progressively, substantially and voluntarily improved its employee stock based compensation grant process prior to 2006, before the intense regulatory and media focus on stock option grant practices began, and no Company employees or officers who may have made discretionary determinations that resulted in measurement date errors in the past has any continuing role relating to the distribution, administration or accounting for stock based compensation. As a result of the findings of the voluntary review, the Board of Directors has concluded, upon the recommendation of management and the Audit Committee, that the consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, should no longer be relied upon. As a result, we are restating our previously issued financial statements for fiscal years 2003 through 2006, inclusive, to correct errors related to accounting for total stock based compensation expense. The pre tax, non cash charges to be restated are an aggregate $34.8 million for stock based compensation expense over the 18 year period of the review through fiscal 2006. Approximately $21.7 million of the restated amounts apply to the income statements for fiscal years 2003 through 2006, inclusive, and the remainder, which is applicable to prior fiscal years, has been recorded as a charge to retained earnings as of January 31, 2002. Such charges have the effect of decreasing net income and, correspondingly, retained earnings as reported in our historical financial statements. The net of tax impact of the stock based compensation adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were insignificant. However, we restated our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2006 to properly reflect Retained Earnings, Common Stock and Deferred Compensation balances as a result of previous period adjustments. During the period of the voluntary stock option review, we determined that we incorrectly recorded certain credits to resellers. As a result, adjustments were made to increase net revenues and decrease deferred revenue by $14.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2005. These adjustments, which have the effect of increasing net income and, correspondingly, retained earnings, are described in more detail below. This Form 10 K reflects the restatement of our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2006, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, and each of the quarters in fiscal 2006. This Form 10 K also reflects the restatement of Selected Consolidated Financial Data in Item 6 for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005. Previously filed annual reports on Form 10 K and quarterly reports on Form 10 Q prior to fiscal 2007 have been affected by the restatements, have not been amended, and should not be relied on. In connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, we applied judgment in determining whether to revise measurement dates for prior option grants. In addition, if we determined that a measurement date needed to be revised, judgment was applied in determining the appropriate measurement date. In addition, we have restated the pro forma expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123) in Part II, Item 8, Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to include these adjustments for the years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005. All references to the number of option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices in this section have been adjusted for any subsequent stock splits. 34 Table of Contents Stock Option Grant Process Pursuant to our non director stock plans, our Board of Directors has the authority to grant options or delegate this authority to a committee. For portions of the relevant period, the right to grant options under our stock plans to all employees other than non employee directors was delegated to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or to the chief executive officer, or CEO, as a committee of one. Executive officer option grants were generally approved by the Compensation Committee during regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meetings, although a small number were approved by unanimous written consent. Option grants by the CEO to all other employees were generally done on a monthly basis by written consent during the period between December 1995 and August 2006. Accounting Adjustments Consistent with the applicable accounting literature and recent guidance from the SEC staff, we organized the 230 separate stock option grant approvals, totaling approximately 46,300 individual grants, made during the relevant period into categories based on grant type and the processes by which the grant approval was finalized. We analyzed the evidence from the Audit Committees review related to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents, electronic documents, underlying electronic data about documents, and witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, we applied the then appropriate accounting standards to determine, for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, resulting in stock based compensation expense and related tax effects. After accounting for forfeitures, we recognized stock based compensation expense of $34.8 million on a pre tax basis over the vesting terms for the affected grants. No adjustments were required for the remaining grants. The adjustments were determined by category as follows: Monthly Date Selection Process Grants For the period between July 2000 and February 2005, we generally followed an administrative process for monthly broad based employee grants that resulted in the selection of effective grant dates that were prior in time to the final preparation of action by written consent for such grants (the Monthly Date Selection Process Grants). Usually, the grant dates selected by this process were chosen later in the same calendar month in which the applicable actions by written consent were signed and were dates prior in time to the final preparation of such written consents to coincide with low trading prices during the month of the applicable grant. Based on the voluntary review, the Company determined that the measurement dates for approximately 12,000 individual grants of the approximate total 18,500 individual grants made to broad based employees pursuant to delegated authority must be revised because the grant dates selected by the administrative process were prior in time to the final approval of such grants. For these grants, based upon the available evidence we chose as the measurement date the date upon which the terms of the specific monthly broad based employee grant was determined to be fixed and unchangeable. Accordingly, we recognized a pre tax stock based compensation expense of $23.1 million for such grant approvals using the intrinsic value method of accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25). 1992 New Hire Grant to Incoming CEO In May 1992, the Compensation Committee approved a grant to the Companys then incoming CEO that was measured on an incorrect date. The measurement date used was April 7, 1992, the date the Company and the incoming CEO had reached a business agreement on most of the terms of her employment agreement, including the number of stock options to be granted. However, discussions thereafter continued regarding other important matters, including the structure of, and exercise price for, her stock option grant. The essential terms of the option grant, the grant price, number of options and date of grant, were presented to the Board on April 27, 1992, and approved by the Compensation Committee on May 4, 1992. In connection with the grant to the then incoming CEO, both parties were represented by counsel. We recognized pre tax stock based compensation expense of $3.3 million from this grant based on a revised measurement date of May 4, 1992 using the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB 25. Anomalous Add Grants Based on the voluntary review, the Audit Committee found that in certain instances, additions or error corrections were made to the details of grants that had already been approved by the 35 Table of Contents CEO without obtaining additional approval (the Anomalous Add Grants). For the period between December 1995 through August 2006 when the CEO had delegated authority to grant options, 420 of approximately 37,100 individual option grants were considered to be Anomalous Add Grants, for a total error rate of 1.1%, with 98% of Anomalous Add Grants occurring prior to fiscal 2003. Based on the voluntary review, management determined that the measurement dates for the related individual option grants must be revised. Accordingly, we recognized pre tax stock based compensation expense of $3.1 million from such grants using the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB 25. Termination Issues During the relevant period, two former executives and 34 employees were permitted to vest in (and subsequently exercise) stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock for a period of time beyond what they were otherwise entitled to exercise under their original stock option agreement. In most cases, vesting was extended for a period of time after the termination date and, thus, should have resulted in accounting consequences. For the 34 employees, it appears that these cases were most likely due to administrative error. Based on the voluntary review, management determined that the accounting for the related option grants must be revised and we recognized pre tax stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million from such grants using the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB 25. Board Authorized Grant In 1992, the Board approved a broad based employee grant, which included a grant to the Companys then CFO and then General Counsel, that involved a measurement date error. The error was caused by the Companys use of the date on which the Board approved the general scope and nature of a special one time grant to certain employees as the measurement date, rather than the date on which the specific grantees and grant amounts were finalized and approved by the Board. In addition, in 1991, the Board approved a broad based employee grant with an exercise price less than the fair market value on the date of grant. Accordingly, we recognized pre tax stock based compensation expense of $2.4 million from these grants. Compensation Committee Grants From 1997 through 2000: (i) two individual option grants do not appear to have any evidence of Compensation Committee approval or authorization; (ii) four additional individual option grants appear to have been ratified at a date subsequent to the original grant date; and (iii) the original measurement date of one additional option grant approved by a Unanimous Written Consent of the Compensation Committee appears to have been made more than a reasonable period of time prior to final approval of the grant for accounting purposes. Based on the voluntary review, management determined that the measurement dates for the related option grants must be revised. Accordingly, we recognized pre tax stock based compensation expense of $0.6 million from seven grants. Judgment In light of the judgment used in establishing revised measurement dates, alternate approaches to those used by us could have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those recorded by us in the restatement. We considered various alternative approaches. For Monthly Date Selection Process Grants, where for certain of the grants, there was no evidence to suggest a particular single date was the appropriate measurement date, Company management narrowed the possible measurement date to a range of dates or a grant window. The grant window was approximately four days on average and ranged from one day to sixteen days. The Companys management considered which date to use in this range and chose to use the last day of the grant window since the grants appeared to be fixed and unchangeable. We believe the grant was fixed and unchangeable on the last day in the grant window because this was the day the award was communicated. Changing the measurement dates from the last day of the grant window to the highest price during the grant window would cause the pre tax compensation charges discussed above to increase by approximately $2.0 million. Changing the measurement dates from the last day of the grant window to the lowest price during the grant window would cause the pre tax compensation charges discussed above to decrease by approximately $11.9 million. 36 Table of Contents For the Anomalous Add Grants, Company management determined that the measurement date was the date the individual grant was fixed and unchangeable. This was the date by which the award was likely communicated to the employee. Alternatively, we considered the date on which the employee and relevant grant information were added to the grant list. However, because that date did not necessarily represent a date that the award was either approved or communicated to the employee, we rejected that alternative. We believe the grant was fixed and unchangeable on the last day in the grant window because this was the day the award was communicated. Changing the measurement dates for the Anomalous Add Grants from the date upon which the terms of the grant were likely communicated to the employee to the date when the grant information was likely added to the grant list would cause the pre tax compensation charges discussed above to decrease by approximately $1.3 million. Changing the measurement dates for the Anomalous Add Grants from the date upon which the terms of the award were likely communicated to the employee to the highest price in the grant window would cause the pre tax compensation charges to increase by approximately $2.3 million. We believe that the approaches we used for each of the categories were the most appropriate under the circumstances. Financial Impact of the Restatement The increase in net revenues and stock based compensation expense resulting from the restatement is as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Net Revenues Stock basedCompensationExpense TaxEffect(1) TotalAdjustments,Net of Tax 1992 $ $ (0.1 ) $ $ (0.1 ) 1993 (2.0 ) 0.7 (1.3 ) 1994 (1.2 ) 0.4 (0.8 ) 1995 (1.2 ) 0.4 (0.8 ) 1996 (0.6 ) 0.2 (0.4 ) 1997 (0.5 ) 0.2 (0.3 ) 1998 (0.3 ) 0.1 (0.2 ) 1999 (0.5 ) 0.2 (0.3 ) 2000 (1.3 ) 0.2 (1.1 ) 2001 (1.5 ) 0.2 (1.3 ) 2002 (3.9 ) 1.1 (2.8 ) 2003 (5.0 ) 0.8 (4.2 ) 2004 (4.8 ) (0.3 ) (5.1 ) Total 1992 2004 impact (22.9 ) 4.2 (18.7 ) 2005 5.1 (7.3 ) 1.8 (0.4 ) 2006 14.0 (4.6 ) (4.7 ) 4.7 Total: $ 19.1 $ (34.8 ) $ 1.3 $ (14.4 ) (1) Includes $2.5 million of payroll tax expenses. The net of tax impact of the stock based compensation adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was insignificant. However, we restated our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2006 to properly reflect Retained Earnings, Common Stock and Deferred Compensation balances as a result of previous period adjustments. Please refer to Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We also restated the pro forma expense under SFAS 123 in Note 1 Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K to reflect the impact of these adjustments for the years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005. 37 Table of Contents As mentioned above, while performing the voluntary stock option review, we identified that we incorrectly recorded certain credits to resellers. Certain credits to resellers for sales of new and renewal maintenance were recognized as a reduction of license and other revenues and maintenance revenues in the period the transaction was billed. These credits should have been recorded as a reduction of deferred maintenance revenue when the transaction was billed which would have resulted in a reduction to maintenance revenues over the maintenance period. The impact of this restatement resulted in adjustments to increase net revenues and decrease deferred revenues of $14.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2005. For more information regarding our restated financial statements, see Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Item 8 and Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Selected Consolidated Financial Data in Item 6 and Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited) in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Strategy Our goal is to be the worlds leading design software and services company for the building, manufacturing, infrastructure, and media and entertainment industries. Our focus is to offer our customers the ability to create and manage great designs and simulate reality through our software and to help them experience their ideas before they become real. We believe that our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages. By innovating in existing technology categories, we bring powerful design products to volume markets. Our products are designed to be easy to learn and use, and to provide customers low cost of deployment, low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment. Our architecture allows for extensibility and integration. We have created a large global community of resellers, third party developers and customers, which provides us with a broad reach into volume markets. Our reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and cost efficient training services. We have a significant number of registered third party developers, creating products that run on top of our products, further extending our reach into volume markets. Our installed base of millions of users has made Autodesks products a worldwide design software standard. Users trained on Autodesk products are broadly available both from universities and the existing workforce, reducing the cost of training for our customers. We offer education programs and specially priced software purchasing options tailored for educational institutions, students, and faculty to train the next generation of users. We also offer classroom support, including standardized curricula developed by educators, instructor development, and a rich assortment of online learning resources. Our growth strategy derives from these core strengths. We continue to increase the business value of our desktop design tools for our customers in a number of ways. We improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release, and we have increased the frequency of most of our releases. Our most recent major product releases occurred in March 2007. Beyond our horizontal design products, we develop products addressing specific vertical market needs. In addition, we believe that migration of our customers from our 2D products to our 3D model based products, which generally have higher prices, presents a significant growth opportunity. While the rate of migration to 3D varies from industry to industry, adoption of 3D design software should increase the productivity of our customers in all industries and result in richer design data. However, this migration also poses various risks to us. In particular, if we do not successfully convert our 2D customer base to our 3D model based products as expected, and sales of our 2D products decrease without a corresponding increase in customer seats of our 3D model based products, we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected. 38 Table of Contents Expanding our geographic coverage is a key element of our growth strategy. We believe that rapidly growing economies, including those of China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America, present significant growth opportunities for us. However, conducting business in these rapidly growing economies presents significant challenges, including intellectual property protection and software piracy which remains a substantial problem. Another significant part of our growth strategy is to improve upon our installed base business model. A key element of this strategy is our ability to release major products on an annual basis. Strong annual release cycles have a number of benefits. In particular, they permit us to deliver key performance and functionality improvements to customers on a regular and timely basis. Annual releases also help us to increase product maintenance revenues and significantly reduce our reliance on product upgrade revenues, thereby reducing the volatility of revenues. We are continually focused on improving productivity and efficiency in all areas of Autodesk in order to allow us to increase our investment in growth initiatives and improve our profitability. However, our operating margin declined to 19% during fiscal 2007 compared with 25% during fiscal 2006. This decline in our operating margin was driven primarily by our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 revised 2004, Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. As a result of this new accounting pronouncement, we recorded stock based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 of $94.3 million which decreased operating margins by 5%. In addition, we experienced increased amortization expense during fiscal 2007 primarily from our acquisition of Alias in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006. Amortization expense of acquisition related intangibles, primarily related to our acquisition of Alias, of $14.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $0.7 million in fiscal 2006, decreased our operating margin by 1%. Finally, costs incurred as a result of our stock option review, including a bonus payment to participants of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), reduced our operating margin by 1%. See further discussion of this ESPP bonus payment at Stock Compensation within this Item. These decreases in operating margin were offset by productivity initiatives across our organization. We continue to invest in growth initiatives and, over the longer term, we intend to continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our goal of increasing our operating margins. We generate significant cash flows. Our uses of cash include share repurchases to offset the dilutive effect of our employee stock plans as well as investments in acquisitions and investments in growth initiatives, such as our recent acquisition of Constructware, and our equity investment in Hanna Strategies during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. See Note 15, Business Combinationsand Note 16, Related Parties, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We evaluate merger and acquisition and divestiture opportunities to the extent they support our strategy. Our typical acquisitions, which are an integral part of our growth initiatives, are intended to provide specific technology or expertise, adjacency to our current products and services and rapid product integration. Additionally, we continue to invest in other growth initiatives including product development and sales, market and channel development. Design Solutions Segment During fiscal 2007, the Design Solutions Segment consisted of the following divisions: Platform Technology Division and Other, which included our horizontal design products, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, and Autodesk Consulting and Autodesk Collaboration Services; Manufacturing Solutions Division; Building Solutions Division; and Infrastructure Solutions Division. For the Platform Technology Division , our focus during fiscal 2007 was on providing CAD design tools and technologies that allow our customers in multiple markets to create, manage, and share design data. Our primary product offerings were AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT software and our Autodesk Buzzsaw service. AutoCAD software is a customizable and extendable computer aided design (CAD) application for 2D drafting, detailing, functional design documentation and basic 3D model based design. AutoCAD LT software is used for 39 Table of Contents 2D drafting and detailing by design professionals who require full DWG file format compatibility and document sharing capability without the need for software customization or 3D functionality. Autodesk Buzzsaw is an on demand collaboration service that allows users to store, manage and share project information from any internet connection. For the Manufacturing Solutions Division, our focus during fiscal 2007 was to provide comprehensive design and data management solutions that enable our manufacturing customers to rapidly adopt 3D design, create designs in a simple 2D/3D environment and manage design data. Our primary solution offering was the Autodesk Inventor Family of Products, which delivers Autodesk Mechanical Desktop, based on AutoCAD software, and Autodesk Inventor in one solution, and Autodesk AutoCAD Mechanical, which offers 2D mechanical design and engineering tools that are compatible with all AutoCAD based products. For the Building Solutions Division, our focus during fiscal 2007 was to enable our customers to create high quality building designs and documentation, accurately estimate project costs and manage project workflows, and provide comprehensive solutions that enable them to rapidly adopt 3D designs. Our primary product offerings were: Autodesk Architectural Desktop for architects and Autodesk Building Systems for Mechanical, Electrical, Planning (MEP) engineering firms, both based on AutoCAD software; and a complete suite of design software built on the Autodesk Revit platform for building information modeling (BIM). These include Autodesk Revit Building for architects, Autodesk Revit Structure for structural engineers, and Autodesk Revit Systems for the engineering of building mechanical and electrical systems. For the Infrastructure Solutions Division, our focus during fiscal 2007 was to enable our customers to compile, analyze and maintain digital design information, design and manage physical infrastructure projects, distribute geospatial information on the web, and provide them with comprehensive solutions that enable them to rapidly adopt 3D designs. Our primary product offerings were Autodesk Map 3D for precision mapping and geographic information system analysis in the AutoCAD environment, Autodesk Civil 3D and Autodesk Land Desktop. We believe customers in the web mapping market are demanding more frequent software releases, faster support for new standards, faster access to new data sources, and lower cost of ownership for their web mapping solutions. Media and Entertainment Segment The Media and Entertainment Segment serves the digital media sector and during fiscal 2007 was divided into two business lines: (1) Animation and (2) Advanced Systems. Principal product offerings in our Animation business line were: Autodesk 3ds Max and Autodesk Maya. Autodesk 3ds Max is modeling, animation, and rendering software that enables game developers, design visualization professionals, and visual effects artists to communicate abstract or complex mechanical, architectural, engineering, and construction concepts. Autodesk Maya is a 3D modeling, animation, effects, and rendering solution that enables film and video artists, game developers, and design visualization professionals to create engaging, lifelike digital images, realistic animation, and extraordinary visual effects. A key component of our strategy is the realization of a complete and comprehensive 3D animation portfolio and workflow. Principal product offerings in our Advanced Systems business line include Autodesk Flame, Autodesk Inferno and Autodesk Flint, our scalable line of interactive real time visual effects and graphics design solutions; and Autodesk Smoke and Autodesk Fire, our scalable line of interactive real time non linear editing and finishing systems. In the film, commercial, and broadcast markets, our focus remains on visual effects design, editing and finishing tools, where we plan to continue to expand our software feature sets and improve data interoperability, while continuing to transition these products to lower cost standard, open, PC based Linux platforms. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates 40 Table of Contents that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We regularly reevaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. Our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with Statement of Position 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For multiple element arrangements that include software products, we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method, under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value. VSOE is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority. If we do not have VSOE of the undelivered element, we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements are delivered. We are required to exercise judgment in determining whether VSOE exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent. Our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical element in determining the timing of revenue recognition. If we do not believe that collection is probable, the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or cash is received. Our product license revenues from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor or reseller provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. This policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria. We are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments, regardless of whether they collect cash from their customers. Our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Product Returns Reserves. We permit our distributors and resellers to return products up to a percentage of prior quarter purchases and to return product when new product releases supersede older versions. The product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns, estimated channel inventory levels, the timing of new product introductions and promotions, channel sell in for applicable markets and other factors. Our product returns reserves were $18.2 million at January 31, 2007 and $14.2 million at January 31, 2006. Product returns as a percentage of applicable revenues were 3.9% in fiscal 2007, 3.7% in fiscal 2006 and 4.1% in fiscal 2005. During fiscal year 2007, we recorded additions to our product returns reserves of $57.1 million, which reduced our revenue. While we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns reserves is adequate and appropriate, any adverse activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made. 41 Table of Contents Realizability of Long Lived Assets. We assess the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. We consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget; shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and the results of past impairment reviews. In assessing the recoverability of these long lived assets, we first determine their fair values, which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets. When assessing long lived assets, we use undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows. Because expected lives are relatively short, discounting the projected cash flows would not lead to a significantly different result. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of the impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result in situations where the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values. In addition to our recoverability assessments, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters. We will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges. Goodwill. As required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we no longer amortize goodwill, but test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. When assessing goodwill for impairment, we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill assets are impaired or the amount of the impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges. Deferred Tax Assets. We currently have $137.9 million of net deferred tax assets, mostly arising from net operating losses, including stock option deductions taken in fiscal years prior to fiscal 2007, as well as tax credits and reserves offset by the establishment of U.S. deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and taxable temporary differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software. We perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets, which is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income of approximately $519 million across a specific mix of geographies. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors. These changes, if any, may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made. Autodesk is a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is based on expected geographic mix of earnings, statutory rates, transfer pricing, and enacted tax rules. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. We believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. It is possible that these positions may be challenged which may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate. Stock Option Accounting. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 revised 2004, Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which replaces Statement of 42 Table of Contents Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123) and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share Based Payment (SAB 107), which provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, as well as provides the SEC staffs views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of February 1, 2006, the first day of our fiscal year 2007. Our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2007 reflect our adoption of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated for, and do not include the impact of, compensation expense calculated under SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25, as permitted by SFAS 123. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense resulted primarily from stock option grants to non executive employees at exercise prices below fair market value on the option measurement date. The majority of these grants were made between August 2000 and February 2005. We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for employee stock awards. This is the same option pricing model used in prior years to calculate the pro forma compensation expense under our SFAS 123 footnote disclosures. This model requires the input of assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate of each award. The parameters used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted, as needed. Compensation expense for employee stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award. The adoption of SFAS 123R also requires certain changes to the accounting for income taxes, the method used in determining diluted shares, the application of a pre vesting forfeiture rate against both pre and post adoption grants, as well as additional disclosure related to the cash flow effects resulting from share based compensation. The relevant interpretive guidance of SAB 107 was applied in connection with the implementation and adoption of SFAS 123R. See Note 3, Employee and Director Benefit Plans, for more information on this new standard. We are restating our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2006, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005, and each of the quarters in fiscal 2006 to include net revenues and stock based compensation adjustments. Previously filed annual reports on Form 10 K and quarterly reports on Form 10 Q affected by the restatements have not been amended and should not be relied on. In connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, we applied judgment and sensitivity analysis in choosing whether to revise measurement dates for prior option grants. In addition, if we determined that a measurement date needed to be revised, judgment and sensitivity analysis was applied in determining the appropriate measurement date. 43 Table of Contents The increase in net revenues and stock based compensation expense resulting from the restatement is as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year NetRevenues Stock basedCompensationExpense TaxEffect(1) TotalAdjustments,Net of Tax 1992 $ $ (0.1 ) $ $ (0.1 ) 1993 (2.0 ) 0.7 (1.3 ) 1994 (1.2 ) 0.4 (0.8 ) 1995 (1.2 ) 0.4 (0.8 ) 1996 (0.6 ) 0.2 (0.4 ) 1997 (0.5 ) 0.2 (0.3 ) 1998 (0.3 ) 0.1 (0.2 ) 1999 (0.5 ) 0.2 (0.3 ) 2000 (1.3 ) 0.2 (1.1 ) 2001 (1.5 ) 0.2 (1.3 ) 2002 (3.9 ) 1.1 (2.8 ) 2003 (5.0 ) 0.8 (4.2 ) 2004 (4.8 ) (0.3 ) (5.1 ) Total 1992 2004 impact (22.9 ) 4.2 (18.7 ) 2005 5.1 (7.3 ) 1.8 (0.4 ) 2006 14.0 (4.6 ) (4.7 ) 4.7 Total: $ 19.1 $ (34.8 ) $ 1.3 $ (14.4 ) (1) Includes $2.5 million of payroll tax expenses.

As described in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Part II, Item 8, Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings. We routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. Because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006, the SEC staff released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108) which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. We applied the provisions of SAB 108 using the cumulative effect transition method in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2007. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). This Statement requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the statement of financial position. The Standard also requires recognition in other comprehensive income of certain gains and losses that arise during the period but are deferred under pension accounting rules, as well as modifies the timing of reporting and adds certain disclosures. SFAS 158 provides recognition and disclosure elements to be effective as of the end of the fiscal year after December 15, 2006 and measurement elements to be effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. We have adopted the recognition and disclosure elements of the Statement which have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we adopted the measurement elements of the Standard as of February 1, 2007, the beginning of our fiscal year 2008. The adoption of the measurement elements of SFAS 158 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB also issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but instead is intended to eliminate inconsistencies with respect to this topic found in various other accounting pronouncements. This Statement is effective for our 2009 fiscal year, including interim periods within our 2009 fiscal year. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. Under FIN 48, companies are required to recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarified how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. Based on our assessment, we recorded an increase to opening retained earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 for tax benefits not previously recognized of approximately $26 million as a result of adopting FIN 48. 48 Table of Contents In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (SFAS 155). This Statement amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS 140). SFAS 155 simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of SFAS 133 and SFAS 140. The adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Overview of Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations For the year endedJanuary 31, 2007 As a % of NetRevenues For the year endedJanuary 31, 2006 As a % of NetRevenues As Restated(1) (in millions) Net Revenues $ 1,839.8 100 % $ 1,537.2 100 % Cost of revenues 216.6 12 % 171.1 11 % Operating expenses 1,273.5 69 % 987.6 64 % Income from operations $ 349.7 19 % $ 378.5 25 % (1) See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. The primary goals for fiscal 2007 were to continue our delivery of market leading products and solutions to our customers in order to drive revenue growth, market share gains and increases in operating cash flow. We achieved these goals as demonstrated by our 20% net revenue increase and our 38% increase in cash from operations from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. The strength of our products and their market acceptance and our acquisition of Alias and Constructware led to strong growth in net revenue and increased market share. During fiscal 2007 we released our 2007 family of products, grew maintenance revenues by 54%, our maintenance installed base to over 1.2 million users, 3D revenues by 41%, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenues by 11%, revenues from emerging economies by 39% and Animation revenues by 97%. The growth numbers include acquisition related revenue, primarily from our acquisition of Alias in January 2006. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we successfully completed the integration of Alias. Our net revenues were higher in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due primarily to growth in sales of new seats and maintenance revenues, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from upgrades. Increase in revenues of 19% from the sales of new seats was driven by volume growth and higher average sales prices in AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, and our 3D products, as well as revenues from our Maya, StudioTools, and other animation products resulting from our January 2006 acquisition of Alias. Maintenance revenues from our Subscription Program increased 54%, reflecting strength in subscription attachment and renewal rates during fiscal 2007. Revenues from upgrades decreased by 7% driven primarily by the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of the AutoCAD based products as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 compared to the upgradeable base of the AutoCAD based products in fiscal 2006 and the success of our Subscription Program. In addition, our aggregate backlog, primarily comprised of deferred revenue and current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped, increased from $283.5 million at January 31, 2006 to $395.8 million at January 31, 2007. We generate a significant amount of our revenue in the United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Canada, China, South Korea and Australia. Foreign currencies had a minimal effect on financial results for fiscal 2007. The weaker value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies had a negative effect of 49 Table of Contents $0.6 million on operating results in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. If exchange rates from fiscal 2006 would have been in effect during fiscal 2007, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been $1.0 million lower and operating expenses would have been $1.6 million lower. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may have a significant effect on net revenues in future periods. We use foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce the current quarter exchange rate effect on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions. The percentage of total costs and expenses increased to 81% of net revenues in fiscal 2007 from 75% of net revenues in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily due to our adoption of SFAS 123R commencing from the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Total stock based compensation expense of $94.3 million was recorded in fiscal 2007, resulting in a 5% increase in total costs and expenses as a percent of net revenues. In addition, we experienced increased operating costs due to the acquisition and integration of Alias. Amortization of acquisition related intangibles, primarily from the Alias acquisition, of $14.4 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $0.7 million in fiscal 2006, increased total costs and expenses as a percent of net revenues by 1%. Finally, costs of $15.0 million incurred as a result of our stock option review, including a bonus payment to participants in our ESPP, increased our total costs and expenses as a percent of net revenues by 1%. These increases in total costs and expenses were offset by productivity initiatives across our organization. Our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenues, given the relatively fixed nature of most of our expenses, which consist primarily of employee related expenditures, facilities costs, and depreciation and amortization expense. During fiscal 2008, we expect total costs and expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of net revenues as we balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our focus on increasing profitability. Throughout fiscal 2007, we maintained a strong balance sheet and generated $576.6 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $415.2 million in the previous year. We finished the year with $777.9 million in cash and marketable securities, up from $377.5 million at January 31, 2006. This increase resulted primarily from the temporary cessation of share repurchases during the second half of fiscal 2007. Our voluntary stock option review and our inability to meet our filing requirements with the SEC prohibited share repurchases during the second half of fiscal 2007. We increased our cash and marketable securities while continuing to invest in our business through the acquisition of Constructware, investment in Hanna Strategies and repurchase of 4.2 million shares of our common stock during the first half of fiscal 2007. We completed fiscal 2007 with a higher deferred revenue balance as compared to the previous year. Our deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2007 included $328.2 million of customer subscription contracts which will be recognized as maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the contracts, which is predominantly one year. 50 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Revenues Increase (decrease)compared to priorfiscal year Increase (decrease)compared to priorfiscal year Fiscal 2007 $ percent Fiscal 2006 $ percent Fiscal 2005 As Restated(1) As Restated(1) (in millions) Net Revenues: License and other $ 1,415.9 $ 154.1 12 % $ 1,261.8 $ 196.5 18 % $ 1,065.3 Maintenance 423.9 148.5 54 % 275.4 101.8 59 % 173.6 $ 1,839.8 $ 302.6 20 % $ 1,537.2 $ 298.3 24 % $ 1,238.9 Net Revenues by Geographic Area: Americas $ 734.5 $ 111.3 18 % $ 623.2 $ 107.2 21 % $ 516.0 Europe, Middle East and Africa 687.5 129.3 23 % 558.2 114.5 26 % 443.7 Asia/Pacific 417.8 62.0 17 % 355.8 76.6 27 % 279.2 $ 1,839.8 $ 302.6 20 % $ 1,537.2 $ 298.3 24 % $ 1,238.9 Net Revenues by Operating Segment: Design Solutions $ 1,594.6 $ 250.1 19 % $ 1,344.5 $ 273.2 26 % $ 1,071.3 Media and Entertainment 234.6 62.3 36 % 172.3 12.3 8 % 160.0 Other 10.6 (9.8 ) (48 )% 20.4 12.8 168 % 7.6 $ 1,839.8 $ 302.6 20 % $ 1,537.2 $ 298.3 24 % $ 1,238.9 Net Revenues Design Solutions Segment: Platform Technology Division and Other $ 806.1 $ 74.5 10 % $ 731.6 $ 132.1 22 % $ 599.5 Manufacturing Solutions Division 333.1 76.2 30 % 256.9 57.2 29 % 199.7 Building Solutions Division 241.9 64.3 36 % 177.6 53.3 43 % 124.3 Infrastructure Solutions Division 213.5 35.1 20 % 178.4 30.6 21 % 147.8 $ 1,594.6 $ 250.1 19 % $ 1,344.5 $ 273.2 26 % $ 1,071.3 (1) See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Fiscal 2007 Net Revenues Compared to Fiscal 2006 Net Revenues License and other revenues are comprised of two components: all forms of product license revenues and other revenues. Product license revenues include revenues from the sale of new seats, revenues from the Autodesk Upgrade Program and revenues from the Autodesk Crossgrade Program. Other revenues consist of revenue from consulting and training services as well as revenue from the Autodesk Developers Network. Maintenance revenues consist of revenue from our Subscription Program. The increase in net revenues during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was due to an increase in sales of new seats, an increase in the sales of subscription contracts which are recognized as maintenance revenues and an increase in crossgrade revenues. Revenue from the sale of new seats increased due to volume growth and higher average sales prices in our AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, and our 3D products. In addition, the introduction of our Maya and StudioTools products resulting from the January 2006 acquisition of Alias contributed to the growth in revenues during fiscal 2007. We experienced strong growth in all three of our geographic regions and strong growth rates in the emerging economies of Asia/Pacific, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and Latin 51 Table of Contents America from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from upgrades resulting primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products during fiscal 2007 compared to the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products as of the same period in the prior fiscal year. Growth in license and other revenues during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was primarily due to an increase in the sale of commercial new seats for most major products driven by our new product releases during fiscal 2007. Increases in revenue from the sale of new seats were driven by volume growth in AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT and most major products, as well as growing sales of our 3D products. These increases were partially offset by a 7% decrease in revenues from upgrades driven by the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products in fiscal 2007 compared to the size of our AutoCAD based products and the success of our Subscription Program in fiscal 2006. Revenue from the sales of services, training and support are immaterial for all periods presented. We attempt to release new product versions on a regular basis and synchronize our major product retirements with those releases. Our AutoCAD 2004 based products were retired in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The upgradeable installed base of the AutoCAD based products not on subscription during fiscal 2007 was smaller than the upgradeable installed base of AutoCAD based products not on subscription during fiscal 2006. As a result, overall maintenance revenue from subscriptions exceeded revenue from upgrades in fiscal 2007. We expect revenue from upgrades to continue to decline in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Maintenance revenues consist of revenues derived from the Subscription Program. As a percentage of total net revenues, maintenance revenues were 23% for fiscal 2007, 18% for fiscal 2006, and 14% for fiscal 2005. Our Subscription Program, available to most customers worldwide, continues to attract new and renewal customers by providing them with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our periodic product release cycle and enhancements. We expect maintenance revenues to continue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues as a result of increased Subscription Program enrollment. Deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program. To a lesser extent, deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from Autodesk Buzzsaw services, consulting services and deferred license sales. Backlog from current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available license software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period. Aggregate backlog at January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006 was $395.8 million and $283.5 million, respectively, of which $17.0 million for both fiscal years related to current software license product orders which have not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year. We rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the U.S. and international regions, including Tech Data Corporation and their affiliates, who accounted for 12% of fiscal 2007 net revenues and 11% of fiscal 2006 net revenues. Net Revenues by Geographic Area Net revenues in the Americas region increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to strong maintenance revenues, as well as revenues from products acquired in our acquisition of Alias in January 2006 and from growth in revenues from sales of new seats driven by new product releases during fiscal 2007. Revenue from upgrades in the Americas declined by 4% during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated net revenues would have been lower by $0.3 million in fiscal 2007. 52 Table of Contents Net revenues in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in the sale of new seats resulting from new product releases, combined with a strong increase in maintenance revenues and revenue from new products acquired from Alias. Revenues from upgrades in EMEA experienced a 2% decline from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. EMEAs strong growth during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to growth in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and the local emerging economies. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated net revenues would have been lower by $10.3 million in fiscal 2007. Net revenues in the Asia/Pacific (APAC) region increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to strong growth in revenues from sales of new seats resulting from new product releases, followed by strong growth in maintenance revenues. Revenue from upgrades in APAC declined by 29% during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Net revenue growth in APAC during fiscal 2007 primarily occurred in China, South Korea, Australia and India. The increase in APAC net revenue during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year was also due to revenues from new products acquired from Alias. This revenue growth was offset by significant declines in the net revenue growth in Japan for 2D and 3D products. Had exchange rates for fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated net revenues in the APAC region would have been higher by $9.7 million in fiscal 2007. We believe that international net revenues will continue to comprise a significant portion of our total net revenues. Economic weakness in any of the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenues could have an adverse effect on our business in those countries. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could significantly and adversely impact our future financial results for a given period. International net revenues represented 66% of our net revenues in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Net revenues in emerging economies of China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America grew by 39% from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. This growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2007. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated international revenues would have been $1.0 million lower in fiscal 2007. Net Revenues by Operating Segment Design Solutions Segment net revenues increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to both strong sales of new seats and maintenance revenues. These increases were partially offset by a 6% decline in revenues from upgrades in fiscal 2007. Maintenance revenues increased to 24% of Design Solutions Segment revenue during fiscal 2007 compared to 20% in fiscal 2006. Sales of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT continue to comprise a significant portion of our net revenues. Such sales, reflected in the net revenues for the Platform Technology Division and Other, represented 40% of net revenues in fiscal 2007 and 43% of consolidated net revenues in the same period of the prior fiscal year, increasing 11% in absolute dollars between the periods. Net revenues for our 3D model based design products (Autodesk Inventor Family of Products, Autodesk Revit Family of Products and Autodesk Civil 3D) increased 41% during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Total sales of 3D design products represented 22% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2007 compared to 18% in fiscal 2006. A critical component of our growth strategy is to continue to add new 2D users while migrating our customers, including customers of AutoCAD and related vertical industry products, to our 3D products, which generally have higher prices, particularly for annual subscription contracts. However, should sales of 2D products decrease without a corresponding increase in sales of our 3D model based products, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Net revenues for the Media and Entertainment Segment (M&E) increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily from revenue increases in our Animation business line and from both our January 2006 acquisition of Alias and the introduction of new versions of 3ds Max and Maya products during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Although net revenues from Advanced Systems sales did not increase significantly during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, such sales progressively improved during each quarter of fiscal 2007 as a result of substantial progress made in the transition of our Advanced Systems product 53 Table of Contents portfolio from SGI platforms to Linux platforms. We do not expect the transition of our Advanced Systems customers from proprietary SGI platforms to open PC based platforms to continue to adversely impact Advanced Systems revenue in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2006 Net Revenues Compared to Fiscal 2005 Net Revenues The increase in net revenues during fiscal 2006 was due primarily to strong increase in maintenance revenues and an increase in the sale of new seats, continued growth in AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenues, along with a favorable product mix shift towards 3D products which generally have higher sales prices. In addition, we experienced strong growth in all three of our geographic regions and we experienced especially strong growth rates in the emerging economies of China, Eastern Europe, Latin America and India. Growth in license and other revenues during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, was primarily due to an increase in the sale of new seats for most major products and, to a lesser extent, to a modest increase in revenues from upgrades. The increases in revenues from new seats were driven by volume growth in AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, and most major products, and growing sales of our 3D products which generally have higher sales prices. Revenues from upgrades increased in fiscal 2006, but at a lower rate than in fiscal 2005 as customers increasingly migrated to our Subscription Program and as we moved the retirement date of the AutoCAD 2002 based products to the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from the sales of our services, training and support are immaterial for all periods presented. Maintenance revenues consist of revenues derived from the Subscription Program. As a percentage of total net revenues, maintenance revenues were 18% and 14% for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Net Revenues by Geographic Area Net revenues in the Americas region increased during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to strong maintenance revenues and new seat revenues, offset in part by lower revenues from upgrades. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2005 been in effect during the same period of 2006, translated net revenues would have been lower by $1.7 million in fiscal 2006. Net revenues in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to strong maintenance revenues, increased sales of new seats, increased revenues from upgrades and growth in the EMEA emerging markets of Russia, Poland, Czech Republic and the Middle East. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2005 been in effect during the same period of 2006, translated net revenues would have been higher by $7.4 million in fiscal 2006. Net revenues in the Asia/Pacific region increased during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to an increase in the sale of commercial new seats, and to a lesser extent from maintenance revenues and revenues from upgrades as our Subscription Program was introduced in the APAC region after successful introductions first in the Americas and then in EMEA. We experienced strong growth during fiscal 2006 in Japan, China, Australia and South Korea. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2005 been in effect during the same period of 2006, translated net revenues would have been higher by $3.4 million in fiscal 2006. International sales accounted for 66% of our net revenues in fiscal 2006 as compared to 65% in the prior fiscal year. Had exchange rates from fiscal 2005 been in effect during fiscal 2006, translated international revenues would have been $9.1 million higher for fiscal 2006. Net revenues in the emerging economies of China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America grew by 61% between fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006. This growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2006. Net Revenues by Operating Segment Design Solutions Segment net revenues increased during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to strong growth in new seat sales and in maintenance revenues as well as a more modest increase in net 54 Table of Contents revenues from upgrades. Maintenance revenues from our Subscription Program increased to 20% of Design Solutions Segment revenue in fiscal 2006, as compared to 16% in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, sales of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT continue to comprise a significant portion of our net revenues. Such sales, which are reflected in the net revenues for the Platform Technology Division and Other, accounted for 43% of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2006 and and 44% in fiscal 2005, growing 23% in absolute dollars between the periods. Net revenues for our 3D model based design products (Autodesk Inventor Family of Products, Autodesk Revit Family of Products and Autodesk Civil 3D) increased 60% during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Total sales of 3D model based design products accounted for 18% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2006 compared to 14% in fiscal 2005. Net revenues for the Media and Entertainment Segment increased during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily from revenue increases in our Animation business line due to new seats and maintenance revenues derived from 3ds Max. Net revenues from our Advanced Systems business line increased from $110.4 million during fiscal 2005 to $112.3 million during fiscal 2006. This increase resulted from growth in the sales of our Linux based Advanced Systems Products, which were offset in part by recent declines in Advanced Systems sales on the SGI platform. Cost of Revenues Increase (decrease)compared to priorfiscal year Increase (decrease)compared to priorfiscal year Fiscal 2007 $ % Fiscal 2006 $ % Fiscal 2005 As Restated(1) As Restated(1) (in millions) Cost of revenues: License and other $ 207.9 $ 49.9 32 % $ 158.0 $ 5.3 3 % $ 152.7 Maintenance 8.7 (4.4 ) (34 )% 13.1 (3.9 ) (23 )% 17.0 $ 216.6 $ 45.5 27 % $ 171.1 $ 1.4 1 % $ 169.7 As a percentage of net revenues 12 % 11 % 14 % (1) See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Cost of license and other revenues includes direct material and overhead charges, royalties, amortization of purchased technology, hosting costs, labor costs of fulfilling service contracts and order processing and, beginning at the start of fiscal 2007, stock based compensation expense under SFAS 123R. Direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold (mainly workstations manufactured by IBM and SGI for the Media and Entertainment Segment), costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media, printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs. Cost of license and other revenues increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, due to higher amortization of purchased technology resulting from recent acquisitions, stock based compensation expense under SFAS 123R, and an increase in our allowance for excess and obsolete inventory, which together represented 1% of revenues. The increase in cost of license and other revenues during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, was primarily due to higher direct material, overhead and royalty expenses for licensed technology embedded in our products, all of which resulted from increased volumes, partially offset by a reduction in amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software. Cost of maintenance revenues includes direct costs of fulfilling our subscription contracts as well as indirect overhead charges. The decrease in cost of maintenance revenues during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was due primarily to the cessation of amortization for an information technology system supporting our 55 Table of Contents Subscription Program, which became fully amortized during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The amortization reduction was partially offset by incremental direct program costs incurred as part of the growth of our Subscription Program. The decrease in cost of maintenance revenues during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, was due primarily to the cessation of amortization for our information technology system supporting our Subscription Program. The amortization reduction was partially offset by incremental direct program costs incurred as part of the growth of the Subscription Program. Cost of revenues, at least over the near term, are affected by the volume and mix of product sales, changing consulting and hosted service costs, software amortization costs, royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products, new customer support offerings and the impact of expensing employee stock based compensation as required under SFAS 123R. Absent stock based compensation expense, we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues to remain relatively consistent with fiscal 2007. Marketing and Sales Increase compared to priorfiscal year Increasecompared to priorfiscal year Fiscal 2007 $ % Fiscal 2006 $ % Fiscal 2005 As Restated(1) As Restated(1) (in millions) Marketing and sales $ 696.1 $ 140.1 25 % $ 556.0 $ 91.3 20 % $ 464.7 As a percentage of net revenues 38 % 36 % 38 % (1) See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Marketing and sales expenses include salaries, dealer and sales commissions, bonus, travel and facility costs for our marketing, sales, dealer training and support personnel and overhead charges. These expenses also include costs of programs aimed at increasing revenues, such as advertising, trade shows and expositions, and various sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users. Marketing and sales expense from the beginning of fiscal 2007 also includes stock based compensation expense for stock awards granted to marketing and sales employees. The increase of marketing and sales expenses during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was due primarily to a $55.8 million increase in employee related costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount, $41.9 million of stock based compensation expense under SFAS 123R, and $29.6 million of increased marketing and promotion costs related to product launches, trade shows, branding, and demand generation. Marketing and sales expense for fiscal 2007 also included $3.8 million in one time ESPP bonus payments incurred in connection with our voluntary stock option review. Marketing and sales headcount increased as a result of organic growth as well as the acquisition of Alias. The increase of marketing and sales expenses during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, was due primarily to $56.5 million of increased marketing and promotion costs related to product launches, trade shows and branding and $14.3 million of higher employee related costs reflecting increased headcount, which were partially offset by a reduction in commissions and bonus accruals, and an increase in information technology costs. We expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to develop market opportunities, to promote our competitive position and to strengthen our channel support. As a result, we expect marketing and sales expenses to continue to be significant, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues. 56 Table of Contents Research and Development Increasecompared to priorfiscal year Increasecompared to priorfiscal year Fiscal 2007 $ % Fiscal 2006 $ % Fiscal 2005 As Restated(1) As Restated(1) (in millions) Research and development $ 406.3 $ 103.1 34 % $ 303.2 $ 61.7 26 % $ 241.5 As a percentage of net revenues 22 % 20 % 19 % (1) See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and bonuses for software engineers, fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors, purchased in process technology, depreciation of computer equipment used in software development and overhead charges. Research and development expense from the beginning of fiscal 2007 also includes stock based compensation expense under SFAS 123R for stock awards granted to research and development employees. The increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, resulted primarily from an increase in wages and salaries driven by an increase in headcount of $55.4 million, the recognition of $30.1 million of stock based compensation expense under SFAS 123R and a $7.3 million increase in consulting services and in process technology purchases from Hanna Strategies. During fiscal 2007, we incurred a total of approximately $34.3 for consulting services and in process technology purchases from Hanna Strategies compared to $27.0 million in the prior year. The cost of the in process technology acquired from Hanna Strategies was immediately recognized as an expense because the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we also acquired a 28% ownership interest in Hanna Strategies for cash consideration of $12.5 million. See Note 16, Related Parties, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this investment. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2007 also included $3.5 million in one time ESPP bonus payments incurred in connection with our voluntary stock option review. The increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, resulted primarily from efforts to invest additional resources in certain research and development related growth initiatives. Employee related costs increased approximately $19.4 million, reflecting increased headcount, and professional fees increased approximately $18.3 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior fiscal year. During fiscal 2006, we incurred approximately $27.0 million for consulting services and purchased in process technology from Hanna Strategies for our Design Solutions Segment compared to $13.5 million in the prior year. In addition, we recognized $7.9 million of in process research and development costs in connection with our acquisition of Alias and $1.2 million related to our acquisition of Colorfront Ltd. We expect research and development spending will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in product development and continue to acquire new technology. General and Administrative Increasecompared to priorfiscal year Increasecompared to priorfiscal year Fiscal 2007 $ % Fiscal 2006 $ % Fiscal 2005 As Restated(1) As Restated(1) (in millions) General and administrative $ 171.1 $ 42.7 33 % $ 128.4 $ 23.8 23 % $ 104.6 As a percentage of net revenues 9 % 8 % 8 % 57 Table of Contents (1) See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. General and administrative expenses include salaries, benefits, and bonuses for our finance, human resources and legal personnel as well as amortization expense of customer relationships and trademarks acquired from Alias and Constructware, professional fees for legal and accounting services, litigation costs, and overhead costs. General and administrative expense from the beginning of fiscal 2007 also includes stock based compensation expense under SFAS 123R for stock awards granted to general and administrative employees. The increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the recognition of $16.9 million of stock based compensation expense and an increase of $7.9 million in employee related costs, due primarily to an increase in general and administrative headcount. General and administrative headcount increased as a result of organic growth. The increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to an increase of $12.6 million in information technology project costs, $8.1 million in employee related costs, largely resulting from increased headcount, and $2.9 million increase in litigation expenses. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, we incurred significant incremental costs related to our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). We estimate that we incurred approximately $2.1 million during 2007, $2.3 million during fiscal 2006, and $6.4 million during fiscal 2005, which included significant project start up costs. These cost estimates include external consulting and auditing fees and internal employee costs. We expect that general and administrative expenses will modestly decline as a percentage of net revenues in the future yet increase in absolute dollars due to salary increases and continued information technology projects. Restructuring Increase (decrease)compared to prior fiscal year Increase (decrease)compared to prior fiscal year Fiscal 2007 $ % Fiscal 2006 $ % Fiscal 2005 (in millions) Restructuring $ $ $ $ (26.7 ) (100 )% $ 26.7 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we implemented a restructuring plan involving the elimination of employee positions and the closure of a number of offices worldwide at a total cost of $27.5 million (Fiscal 2004 Plan). This plan was designed to improve efficiencies across the organization, reduce operating expense levels to help achieve our targeted operating margins and redirect resources to product development, sales development and other critical areas. The actions approved under the Fiscal 2004 Plan were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors approved a formal restructuring plan that included employee terminations and the closure of certain facilities worldwide (Fiscal 2002 Plan). The remaining outstanding liabilities under this plan relate to ongoing lease termination costs for outstanding operating lease agreements which began expiring in fiscal 2007 and will continue to expire through fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2005, we recorded net restructuring charges of $26.7 million, of which $23.7 million related to the Fiscal 2004 Plan. Of this amount, $19.8 million related to employee termination costs for 316 employees worldwide (186 in the United States and 130 outside the United States) and $3.9 million related to the closure of 58 Table of Contents facilities. Also, we recorded net restructuring charges of approximately $3.0 million for additional office closure costs originally established under the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan. Since the office closures in fiscal 2002, there has been a significant downturn in the commercial real estate market, particularly in areas of the United Kingdom where some of the offices are located. As such, Autodesk is unable to either buy out the remaining lease obligations at favorable amounts or sub lease the space at amounts previously estimated. For additional information regarding restructuring reserves, see Note 6, Restructuring Reserves, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and Other Income, Net The following table sets forth the components of interest and other income, net (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Interest and investment income, net $ 20.7 $ 13.2 $ 7.2 Interest expense (2.1 ) Foreign based stamp taxes (2.8 ) Loss from unconsolidated subsidiary (4.3 ) Recovery of acquisition related escrow 2.2 Gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions (0.3 ) (0.7 ) 0.8 Legal proceeding settlement 2.4 Net realized gains on sales of marketable securities 0.5 Other income 0.6 0.7 3.3 $ 16.8 $ 13.2 $ 11.4 Investment income fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances, average maturities and interest rates. The increase in interest and investment income, net, during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 reflects proportionately higher interest rate yields and cash balances during the current fiscal year. The increase in interest and investment income, net, during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 reflects proportionately higher interest rate yields during 2006 when compared with 2005. During fiscal 2007 we also received a $2.1 million recovery of funds from an escrow account established for a prior acquisition. In addition, our 28% ownership interest in Hanna Strategies is accounted for under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, and FASB Interpretation No. 35, Criteria for Applying the Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. Accordingly, the loss from unconsolidated subsidiary represents our 28% ownership interest in Hannas results of operations. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we determined that certain money market fund investments were subject to $2.8 million of Swiss transfer stamp taxes from the third quarter of fiscal 2001 through the second quarter of fiscal 2005. We determined that this adjustment was not material to previously reported periods. During the second quarter of 2005, we received a legal proceeding settlement of $2.4 million as part of a court settlement related to legal proceedings with Spatial Corp. During October 2003, Spatial was ordered to reimburse Autodesk for attorneys fees and trial costs. Provision for income taxes Autodesk accounts for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of 59 Table of Contents assets and liabilities, using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse. Our effective tax rate increased by six percentage points from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily the result of non deductible SFAS 123R expense and a reduction in tax benefits, as a percentage of pre tax earnings, from the repatriation of certain foreign dividends at a rate lower than the 35% Federal statutory rate under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (DRD Legislation). The DRD Legislation was not available during fiscal 2007. Our effective tax rate increased by six percentage points from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily the result of a reduction in tax benefits, as a percentage of pre tax earnings, from (1) the lapse of the statute of limitations, which resulted in the release of tax reserves with respect to prior tax years, and (2) the repatriation of certain foreign dividends at a rate lower than the 35% Federal statutory rate under the DRD Legislation. The increase to the effective tax rate was also partially offset by an increase in tax benefits from international profits taxed at rates less than the U.S. Federal statutory rate. In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. Under FIN 48, companies are required to recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarified how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits, and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. Based on our assessment, we recorded an increase to opening retained earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 for tax benefits not previously recognized of approximately $26 million as a result of adopting FIN 48. Our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the Federal statutory rate, research credits, phase out of extraterritorial income exclusion, SFAS 123R, FIN 48, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, and changes in tax law. At January 31, 2007, we had net deferred tax assets of $137.9 million. Realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately $519 million of future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions. We believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets. For additional information regarding our income tax provision, see Note 4, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 60 Table of Contents Quarterly Financial Information The

However, we restated our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2006 to properly reflect Retained Earnings, Common Stock and Deferred Compensation balances as a result of previous period adjustments. Please refer to Note 2. Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we have restated the pro forma expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123) in Part II, Item 8, Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to include these adjustments for the years ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of cash is from the sale of our products. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs. In addition to operating expenses, we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and to invest in our growth initiatives through business acquisitions. See further discussion of these items below. At January 31, 2007, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $777.9 million and net accounts receivable of $301.3 million. In addition, we also have a U.S. line of credit facility which was established during fiscal 2006. This line of credit permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to $100 million, which is available for working capital or other business needs. The credit agreement contains customary covenants which could restrict liens, certain types of additional debt and dispositions of assets if Autodesk fails to maintain its financial covenants. Because the Company was not current with its reporting obligations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 during the second half of fiscal 2007, the company was in violation of its financial reporting covenant. Autodesk received a waiver from the borrowing institution for the period that it was not in compliance with the covenant. Autodesk pays a quarterly commitment fee, ranging between $25,000 and $62,500, to maintain this facility. This facility, which matures in August 2007, had no borrowings outstanding at January 31, 2007. Long term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following: development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products; financing anticipated growth; the share repurchase program; the acquisition of businesses, software products, or technologies complementary to our business; and capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal use software applications. In addition, $27.2 million of our marketable securities are held in a rabbi trust under non qualified deferred compensation plans as of January 31, 2007. See Note 5, Deferred Compensation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. To minimize the impact of these fluctuations, we use foreign currency option contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to reduce our exposure on firm commitments, primarily certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency instruments, by policy, have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. The principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2007 were the euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, British pound and Japanese yen. We monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. 65 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at January 31, 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at January 31, 2007. Total FY 2008 FY 2009 2010 FY 2011 2012 Thereafter (in millions) Operating lease obligations $ 157.8 $ 41.7 $ 58.8 $ 31.9 $ 25.4 Purchase obligations 37.0 37.0 Total(1) $ 194.8 $ 78.7 $ 58.8 $ 31.9 $ 25.4 (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet or certain purchase obligations as discussed below. For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Autodesk and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies, services and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies, services or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, in most instances, the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. In addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, included in cost of license and other revenues, was $16.8 million, $12.1 million and $9.2 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Principal commitments at January 31, 2007 shown above consist of obligations under operating leases for facilities and computer equipment, IT infrastructure costs, marketing costs and contractual development costs. Purchase commitments also include $28.8 million related to a termination fee for an outsource application hosting services agreement entered into during fiscal 2006. This fee is reduced as time elapses during the five year contract period. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. We provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. Historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities. As of January 31, 2007 we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. 66 Table of Contents Stock Compensation As of January 31, 2007, we maintained two active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and members of Autodesks Board of Directors (Board): the 2006 Employee Stock Plan (available only to employees) and the 2000 Directors Option Plan (available only to non employee directors). Additionally, there are eight expired or terminated plans with options outstanding, including the 1996 Stock Plan which was replaced by the 2006 Employee Stock Plan in March 2006. In connection with our past acquisitions, we have sometimes issued replacement options to employees of the acquired companies. The 2006 Employee Stock Plan reserves 9.65 million shares of Autodesk common stock, plus the shares that remained available for issuance under the 1996 Stock Plan upon its expiration, for issuance under the plan. The 2006 Employee Stock Plan, which will expire in fiscal year 2009, is limited to grants of stock options to employees. At January 31, 2007, 8.0 million shares were available for future issuance under this plan. Our stock option program is broad based and designed to promote long term retention. Essentially all of our employees participate. Approximately 84% of the options we granted during fiscal 2007 were awarded to employees other than our CEO, CFO and the three other most highly compensated officers for fiscal 2006, which we refer to as our Named Executive Officers. Options granted under our equity plans during fiscal 2007 vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within six to ten years of the date of grant. Options granted prior to fiscal 2006 expire within ten years of the date of grant. Since March 2005, the exercise price of stock options granted was equal to the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the grant date. See the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K for further discussion. All stock option grants to executive officers are made by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. All members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee are independent directors, as defined by the listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Grants to our non employee directors are non discretionary and are pre determined by the terms of the 2000 Directors Option Plan. For further information concerning Autodesks policies and procedures regarding the use of stock options, see (a) Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K, (b) Equity Compensation Plan Information, and (c) Compensation Discussion and Analysis in Part III, Item 11, Executive Compensation. On September 18, 2006, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to certain stock option agreements issued pursuant to any of our stock option plans where the optionee has terminated or may terminate his or her employment or service with us and whose outstanding options to purchase our common stock would otherwise expire before, or within 30 days after, we become current in our reporting obligations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. On November 30, 2006, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to extend the expiration dates of certain stock option agreements which were scheduled to expire on December 12, 2006 and which could not be exercised while we were not current in our reporting obligations with the SEC. Stock based compensation expense of $10.4 million was recognized in fiscal 2007 as a result of these modifications. In addition to our stock option plans, our employees are also eligible to participate in Autodesks 1998 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (Employee Stock Purchase Plan, ESP Plan or ESPP). Eligible employees may purchase shares of Autodesks common stock at their discretion using up to 15% of their compensation subject to certain limitations, at not less than 85% of fair market value as defined in the plan agreement. At January 31, 2007, 18.1 million shares were available for future issuance. This amount will automatically be increased on the first trading day of each fiscal year by an amount equal to the lesser of 10.0 million shares or 2.0% of the total outstanding shares plus any shares repurchased by Autodesk during the 67 Table of Contents prior fiscal year. We typically issue shares on March 31 and September 30 of each fiscal year. The provisions of this plan expire during fiscal 2018. Due to the Companys voluntary stock option review during fiscal 2007, we were not current with our reporting obligations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 during the second half of fiscal 2007. As a result, we were unable to issue shares under the ESPP during the second half of fiscal 2007. Stock based compensation expense as a result of the cancellation of the September 30 purchase of $6.1 million that would have been recognized over future periods was recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Autodesk issued 0.8 million shares at an average price of $22.46 per share in fiscal 2007, 1.9 million shares at an average price of $17.99 per share in fiscal 2006, and 4.6 million shares at an average price of $5.73 per share in fiscal 2005. On September 18, 2006, Autodesks Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Companys ESP Plan in response to the Companys temporary suspension of all contributions to and exercises and purchases under the ESPP while the Company was not current in its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In general, this amendment provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period, unless they elected not to participate. The Board of Directors also approved a cash bonus of $8.8 million on September 18, 2006 to non executive employees currently enrolled in the ESPP at that date. This bonus was designed to approximate the profits employee participants would have made on the scheduled September 30, 2006 exercise date, had the purchases been made and the shares been sold on the next trading day at close of market. 68 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our revenues, earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations, but such contracts do not extend beyond the current quarter. Contracts are primarily denominated in euros, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars, British pounds and Japanese yen. We do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Autodesk utilizes foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions. A sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of January 31, 2007 indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2007 would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $0.4 million. A hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at January 31, 2007 would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $0.9 million. The results of the sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of January 31, 2006 indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2006 would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $5.5 million and a hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at January 31, 2006 would have decreased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $2.2 million. We do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts. Interest rate sensitivity At January 31, 2007, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of $112.0 million. These securities were not subject to interest rate fluctuations. At January 31, 2006, we had an investment portfolio of $90.3 million consisting of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances which were not subject to interest rate fluctuations. The short term mutual fund balances included $27.2 million at January 31, 2007 and $22.4 million at January 31, 2006 of amounts held in a rabbi trust under deferred compensation arrangements. See Note 5, Deferred Compensation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk. We place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy guidelines, which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument. 69 Table of Contents
