ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion in our MD&A contains trend analyses and other forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements are any statements that look to future events and consist of, among other things, our business strategies, anticipated future operating results, including net revenue, product backlog, upgrade, crossgrade and maintenance revenue, the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on net revenue and expenses, costs and expenses, including cost of revenue and operating expenses, future income, our anticipated tax rate, planned product retirement and annual release cycle. In addition, forward looking statements also consist of statements involving expectations regarding product acceptance, continuation of our stock repurchase program, and short term and long term cash requirements, as well as, statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as may, believe, could, anticipate, would, might, plan, expect, and similar expressions or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and are subject to business and economic risks. As such, our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth above in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made. Strategy Our goal is to be the worlds leading 2D and 3D design software and services company for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, geospatial mapping and digital media markets. Our focus is to offer our customers the ability to visualize, simulate and analyze real world performance early in the design process to foster innovation, enhance quality, and save time and money. Worldwide business trends such as globalization, sustainability, investment in infrastructure, and the price of oil are creating pressure on our customers to increase innovation while improving productivity. Our customers are seeking differentiation through design, and we believe our products provide a competitive advantage to succeed in this environment. We believe that our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages. By innovating in existing technology categories, we bring powerful design products to volume markets. Our products are designed to be easy to learn and use, and to provide customers low cost of deployment, low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment. In addition, our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration. We have created a large global community of resellers, third party developers and customers, which provides us with a broad reach into volume markets. Our reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and cost efficient training services. We have a significant number of registered third party developers, creating products that operate with our software products, further extending our reach into volume markets. Users trained on our products are broadly available both from universities and the existing work force, reducing the cost of training for our customers. To train the next generation of users, we offer education programs, including classroom support, standardized curricula, instructor development, and specially priced software purchasing options. Our growth strategy derives from these core strengths. We continue to increase the business value of our desktop design tools in a number of ways. We improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release. Our most recent product release commenced in March 2008. Beyond our 2D horizontal design products, we develop products addressing industry specific needs including 2D vertical and 3D model based products. We continually strive to improve our product functionality and specialization by industry while increasing product interoperability and usability. By doing this, we drive technology democratization and increase customer loyalty. 29 Table of Contents In addition, we believe that migration of our customers from our 2D horizontal products to our 2D vertical products and 3D model based design products, presents a significant growth opportunity. For fiscal 2008, revenue from 3D model based design products increased 26% as compared to the prior fiscal year, and Autodesk shipped more than 159,300 commercial seats (which includes new seats and crossgrade seats) of 3D model based design products, including 76,400 seats of Revit, 52,500 seats of Autodesk Inventor and 30,400 seats of AutoCAD Civil 3D. While the rate of migration to 2D vertical products and 3D model based design products varies from industry to industry, adoption of 2D vertical products and 3D model based design software should increase the productivity of our customers in all industries and result in richer design data. However, this migration also poses various risks to us. In particular, if we do not successfully convert our 2D horizontal customer base to our 2D vertical products and 3D model based design products as expected, sales of our 2D horizontal products may decrease without a corresponding increase in customer seats of our 2D vertical products and 3D model based design products, we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected. Expanding our geographic coverage is a key element of our growth strategy. We believe that rapidly growing emerging economies present significant growth opportunities for us. In fiscal 2008, revenue from emerging economies increased 40% as compared to fiscal 2007. Revenue from emerging economies represented 17% of fiscal 2008 net revenue as compared 14% of fiscal 2007 net revenue. Conducting business in these emerging economies presents significant challenges, including intellectual property protection and software piracy, which remain substantial problems. Another significant part of our growth strategy is to continue to move customers to our Subscription Program. We strive to sell subscription contracts to all new customers, migrate existing upgrade customers to subscription contracts and renew subscription contracts with existing subscription customers. This business model results in a more efficient sales process than our traditional upgrade process and reduces volatility in our revenue. Moving customers to our Subscription Program ensures that we have more customers on current versions of our products, increases customer loyalty and increases the likelihood that they will migrate to our 3D model based design products. All revenue from our Subscription Program is Maintenance Revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Maintenance revenue grew 31% in fiscal 2008, as compared to growth of 54% in the prior fiscal year. Our subscription base has grown substantially over the past several years and now consists of nearly 1.5 million users. As a result, while we expect growth in maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program in the future to continue to be strong, we expect the growth rate to be lower than in the past. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We regularly reevaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. Our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with Statement of Position 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition. 30 Table of Contents We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For multiple element arrangements that include software products, we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method, under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value. VSOE is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority. If we do not have VSOE of the undelivered element, we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements are delivered. We are required to exercise judgment in determining whether VSOE exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent. Our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition. If we do not believe that collection is probable, the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received. Our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor or reseller provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. This policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria. We are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. Our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Product Returns Reserves. We permit our distributors and resellers to return products up to a percentage of prior quarter purchases. The product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns, estimated channel inventory levels, the timing of new product introductions and promotions, channel sell in for applicable markets and other factors. Our product returns reserves were $14.4 million at January 31, 2008 and $18.2 million at January 31, 2007. Product returns as a percentage of applicable revenue were 3.5% in fiscal 2008, 3.9% in fiscal 2007 and 3.7% in fiscal 2006. During fiscal year 2008 and 2007, we recorded additions to our product returns reserves of $43.6 million and $57.1 million, respectively, which reduced our revenue. While we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns reserves is adequate and appropriate, any adverse activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made. Partner Incentive Reserves. Autodesk has a Partner Incentive Program that uses quarterly attainment monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period. A portion of these reserves reduce license and other revenue in the current period. The remainder, which relates to incentives on our Subscription Program, reduces deferred revenue in the period the subscription transaction is billed, which results in a reduction to maintenance revenue over the maintenance contract period. Partner incentive reserves were $41.2 million and $28.3 million at January 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Realizability of Long Lived Assets. We assess the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. We consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget; shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and the results of past impairment reviews. 31 Table of Contents In assessing the recoverability of these long lived assets, we first determine their fair values, which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets. When assessing long lived assets, we use undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows. Because expected lives are relatively short, discounting the projected cash flows would not lead to a significantly different result. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of the impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result in situations where the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values. In addition to our recoverability assessments, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters. We will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges. Goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. When assessing goodwill for impairment, we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill assets are impaired or the amount of the impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges. Income Taxes. We currently have $149.4 million of net deferred tax assets, mostly arising from net operating losses including stock option deductions taken in fiscal years prior to fiscal 2007, tax credits, non deductible accruals and timing differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software, offset by the establishment of U.S. deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. We perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets, which is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income of approximately $408 million across a specific mix of geographies. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors. These changes, if any, may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made. Autodesk is a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is based on expected geographic mix of earnings, statutory rates, intercompany transfer pricing, and enacted tax rules. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. We believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. It is possible that these positions may be challenged which may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate. We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 on February 1, 2007. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons such as current year tax positions, expiration of statutes of limitations, litigation, legislative activity, or other changes in facts regarding realizability. Share Based Compensation. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 revised 2004, Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123) and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 32 Table of Contents We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of February 1, 2006, the first day of our fiscal year 2007. Our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2008 and 2007 reflect our adoption of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated for, and do not include the impact of, compensation expense calculated under SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25, as permitted by SFAS 123. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense resulted primarily from stock option grants to non executive employees at exercise prices below fair market value on the option measurement date. The majority of these grants were made between August 2000 and February 2005. We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for employee stock awards. This is the same option pricing model used in prior years to calculate the pro forma compensation expense under our SFAS 123 footnote disclosures. This model requires the input of assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate of each award. The parameters used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted, as needed. Compensation expense for employee stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award. The adoption of SFAS 123R also requires certain changes to the accounting for income taxes, the method used in determining diluted shares, the application of a pre vesting forfeiture rate against both pre and post adoption grants, as well as additional disclosure related to the cash flow effects resulting from share based compensation. Legal Contingencies. As described in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings. We routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. Because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007) Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement will be effective for Autodesks fiscal year beginning February 1, 2009. Autodesk is currently evaluating the impact that SFAS 141R will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB also issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and 33 Table of Contents distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This statement will be effective for Autodesks fiscal year beginning February 1, 2009. Autodesk does not believe the adoption of SFAS 160 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159), which expands the use of fair value measurement by permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. This statement is required to be adopted by Autodesk as of February 1, 2008. Autodesk does not believe the adoption of SFAS 159 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but instead is intended to eliminate inconsistencies with respect to this topic found in various other accounting pronouncements. This statement is effective as of February 1, 2008 for Autodesks 2009 fiscal year, including interim periods within our 2009 fiscal year, with the exception of a one year deferral for the implementation of the statement for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Autodesk does not believe the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Overview of Fiscal 2008 Results of Operations Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31, 2008 As a % of NetRevenue Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31, 2007 As a % of NetRevenue (in millions) Net Revenue $ 2,171.9 100 % $ 1,839.8 100 % Cost of revenue 206.9 9 % 216.6 12 % Operating expenses 1,519.4 70 % 1,273.5 69 % Income from Operations $ 445.6 21 % $ 349.7 19 % The primary goals for fiscal 2008 were to continue our delivery of market leading products and solutions to our customers and to drive revenue growth and increases in operating margins and operating cash flow. During fiscal 2008, we released our 2008 family of products, offering our customers continued advancements in design and authoring productivity as well as digital prototyping and product lifecycle management capabilities. During fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, net revenue increased 18%, income from operations increased 27% and operating cash flow increased 23%. Net revenue for fiscal 2008 increased due to an increase in license and other revenue of 14% and an increase in maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program of 31%. Net revenue for our 2D products and 3D model based design products increased 13%, and 26%, respectively, during fiscal 2008, as compared to the prior fiscal year. A critical component of our growth strategy is to continue to add new 2D horizontal users, while migrating our customers to our higher value 2D vertical and 3D model based design products. Our total operating margin increased from 19% of net revenue in fiscal 2007 to 21% in fiscal 2008. This improvement is primarily due to an increase in our Media and Entertainment Segments operating income by $34.2 million in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating income from our Media and Entertainment Segment was due to higher gross margins from Advanced Systems resulting from a shift to sales of our Linux based systems, a shift to system sales comprised of more software and less hardware and a 22% increase in net revenue from our Animation products. These increases were partially offset by an increase in 34 Table of Contents amortization of acquisition related intangibles of $11.3 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. We continue to invest in growth and productivity initiatives and, over the longer term we intend to continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our goal of increasing our operating margins. Our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenue, given the relatively fixed nature of most of our expenses, which consist primarily of employee related expenditures, facilities costs, and depreciation and amortization expense. For fiscal 2009, we expect total costs and expenses to increase in absolute dollars, but decline slightly as a percentage of net revenue resulting in overall operating margin improvement as compared to fiscal 2008. We will continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our focus on increasing profitability. We generate a significant amount of our revenue in the United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Canada, China, South Korea and Australia. The weaker value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies had a positive effect of $47.4 million on operating income in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Had exchange rates from fiscal 2007 been in effect during fiscal 2008, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been $71.2 million lower and operating expenses would have been $23.8 million lower. Foreign currencies had a minimal effect on financial results for fiscal 2007. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue in future periods. We use foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce a portion of the current quarter exchange rate effect on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions. Throughout fiscal 2008, we maintained a strong balance sheet, generating $708.5 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $576.6 million during the previous fiscal year. We finished fiscal 2008 with $957.7 million in cash and marketable securities, of which $8.4 million is classified as long term. This is an increase from the $777.9 million balance at January 31, 2007. We managed to achieve this increase while repurchasing 12.1 million shares of our common stock and continuing to invest in our business through acquisitions, including Robobat, NavisWorks and Hanna Strategies and investments in other growth initiatives. Comparatively, during the prior fiscal year we repurchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock, completed the acquisition of Constructware and invested in a 28% interest in Hanna Strategies. We completed fiscal 2008 with a higher deferred revenue balance and higher accounts receivable balance as compared to the previous fiscal year. Our deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2008 included $433.8 million of customer maintenance contracts related to our Subscription Program, which will be recognized as maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the contracts, which is predominantly one year. 35 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Revenue Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2008 Increase (decrease)compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2007 Increase (decrease)compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2006 $ % $ % (in millions) Net Revenue: License and other $ 1,618.6 $ 202.7 14 % $ 1,415.9 $ 154.1 12 % $ 1,261.8 Maintenance 553.3 129.4 31 % 423.9 148.5 54 % 275.4 $ 2,171.9 $ 332.1 18 % $ 1,839.8 $ 302.6 20 % $ 1,537.2 Net Revenue by Geographic Area: Americas $ 803.5 $ 69.0 9 % $ 734.5 $ 111.3 18 % $ 623.2 Europe, Middle East and Africa 875.5 188.0 27 % 687.5 129.3 23 % 558.2 Asia Pacific 492.9 75.1 18 % 417.8 62.0 17 % 355.8 $ 2,171.9 $ 332.1 18 % $ 1,839.8 $ 302.6 20 % $ 1,537.2 Net Revenue by Operating Segment: Design Solutions $ 1,895.1 $ 300.5 19 % $ 1,594.6 $ 250.1 19 % $ 1,344.5 Media and Entertainment 258.6 24.0 10 % 234.6 62.3 36 % 172.3 Other 18.2 7.6 72 % 10.6 (9.8 ) 48 % 20.4 $ 2,171.9 $ 332.1 18 % $ 1,839.8 $ 302.6 20 % $ 1,537.2 Net Revenue Design Solutions Segment: Platform Solutions and Emerging Business Division and Other $ 997.1 $ 118.2 13 % $ 878.9 $ 75.6 9 % $ 803.3 Architecture, Engineering and Construction Division 480.0 97.6 26 % 382.4 98.1 35 % 284.3 Manufacturing Solutions Division 418.0 84.7 25 % 333.3 76.4 30 % 256.9 $ 1,895.1 $ 300.5 19 % $ 1,594.6 $ 250.1 19 % $ 1,344.5 Fiscal 2008 Net Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2007 Net Revenue License and Other Revenue License and other revenue are comprised of two components: all forms of product license revenue and other revenue. Product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seats, revenue from the Autodesk Upgrade Program and revenue from the Autodesk Crossgrade Program. Other revenue consists of revenue from consulting and training services, revenue from the Autodesk Developers Network, Autodesk Collaborative Solution hosting revenue, Autodesks Location Services Division and revenue from Advanced Systems product support. Growth in license and other revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to growth in new seat revenue for most major products driven by the release of our 2008 family of products. Total license and other revenue increased 14% for fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of total net revenue, license and other revenue was 75% for fiscal 2008, 77% for fiscal 2007 and 82% for fiscal 2006. We rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the U.S. and international regions, including Tech Data Corporation and its affiliates, who accounted for 14%, 12% and 11% of Autodesks consolidated net revenue for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 36 Table of Contents During fiscal 2008, we made changes to our Partner Incentive Programs to incent our value added resellers to shift their focus to selling 2D vertical products and 3D model based design products. These new programs, which are accounted for as a reduction to net revenue, drive a consistent treatment of incentives around the world by further reallocating incentives from our 2D horizontal products, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, to 2D vertical and 3D model based design products. We believe that changes to our Partner Incentive Programs are having the intended effect of shifting our resellers focus to selling 2D vertical and 3D model based design products. Revenue from the sale of new seats increased 19% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. The increase is due to an 18% increase in revenue from new seats of our 2D products, primarily AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD, AutoCAD Mechanical and AutoCAD Architecture. The increase was also due to a 30% increase in revenue from new seats of our 3D model based design products (Revit products, Autodesk Inventor products, AutoCAD Civil 3D, and NavisWorks software). The increase in new seat revenue was driven primarily by higher average sales prices per seat and volume growth in both our 2D design and 3D model based design products. The positive effect of the weaker value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies also contributed to the increase in total net revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. In addition, we experienced growth in net revenue in all three of our geographic regions and strong growth in the emerging economies of Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. Upgrade revenue, which includes crossgrade revenue, decreased by 17% during fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as expected. The decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products in fiscal 2008 as compared to the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products in fiscal 2007, due to more customers on our Subscription Program. In addition, during the second half of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, AutoCAD LT customers could crossgrade to any other product at a promotional rate, which contributed approximately $9.1 million to upgrade revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to $21.4 million in fiscal 2007. We expect revenue from upgrades to continue to decline as we continue to execute on our strategy of moving customers to our Subscription Program. Revenue from the sales of services, training and support, included in License and other, are immaterial for all periods presented. Maintenance Revenue Maintenance revenue consists of revenue derived from our Subscription Program. Under this program, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available, downloadable training courses and online support. We recognize maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program ratably over the maintenance contract periods. Maintenance revenue increased 31% for fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of total net revenue, maintenance revenue was 25% for fiscal 2008, 23% for fiscal 2007, and 18% for fiscal 2006. Our Subscription Program, available to most customers worldwide, continues to attract new and renewal customers by providing them with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new product releases and enhancements. We expect maintenance revenue to continue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenue as a result of increased Subscription Program enrollment, which is now at nearly 1.5 million users; however, we expect these growth rates to be lower than in the past. This shift away from upgrades toward a more predictable and sustainable maintenance revenue stream from the Subscription Program is consistent with our long term strategy. Due to the increase in our subscription base over time, the relative upgradeable installed base of the AutoCAD based products not on subscription during fiscal 2008 was smaller than the upgradeable installed base of the AutoCAD based products not on subscription during fiscal 2007. Maintenance revenue from subscriptions substantially exceeded revenue from upgrades in fiscal 2008. Aggregate backlog at January 31, 2008 and January 31, 2007 was $521.5 million and $395.8 million, respectively, of which $506.1 million and $378.8 million represented deferred revenue and $15.4 million and 37 Table of Contents $17.0 million, respectively, related to current software license product orders which have not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year. Deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program. To a lesser extent, deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from Autodesk Buzzsaw and Autodesk Constructware services, consulting services and deferred license sales. Backlog from current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available license software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period. Net Revenue by Geographic Area Net revenue in the Americas region increased by 9% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a 22% increase in maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program. Revenue from new seats in the Americas increased 2% during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 driven by new seat revenue from our 3D model based design products offset by a decline in new seat revenue from our 2D products compared to the prior fiscal year. Revenue from upgrades decreased by 14% in the Americas during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year. Growth in the Americas was also impacted by a slowing economy that impacted growth rates for all of our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008, translated net revenue in the Americas would have been $0.1 million lower in fiscal 2008. Net revenue in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region increased by 27% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a 37% increase in new seat revenue and 40% increase in maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program. Revenue from new seats in EMEA increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 driven by new seat revenue from our 2D design products and 3D model based design products. These increases were partially offset by 24% decrease in revenue from upgrades. EMEAs growth during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to growth in the local emerging economies and the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Belgium and Austria. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008, translated net revenue in EMEA would have been $66.7 million lower in fiscal 2008. Net revenue in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region increased 18% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to an 18% increase in new seats revenue, a 32% increase in maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program, and a 9% increase in revenue from upgrades. Revenue from new seats in APAC increased due to strong new seat revenue from our 2D products and 3D model based design products. Net revenue growth in APAC during fiscal 2008 occurred primarily due to growth in the local emerging economies, Japan, South Korea and Australia. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008, translated net revenue in APAC would have been $4.4 million lower in fiscal 2008. We believe that international net revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue. Economic weakness in any of the countries that contributes a significant portion of our net revenue could have an adverse effect on our business in those countries. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could significantly affect our future financial results for a given period. International net revenue represented 69% of our net revenue in fiscal 2008 and 66% of our net revenue in fiscal 2007. Net revenue in emerging economies grew by 40% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to revenue from the EMEA emerging economies, China and India. This growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2008. Net Revenue by Operating Segment Net revenue for the Design Solutions Segment increased 19% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a 21% increase in new seat revenue and a 32% increase in maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program. These increases were partially offset by a 17% decrease in upgrade revenue in fiscal 2008 38 Table of Contents as compared to fiscal 2007. Maintenance revenue increased to 26% of Design Solutions Segment revenue during fiscal 2008 compared to 24% in fiscal 2007. Net revenue for the Media and Entertainment Segment increased 10% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, net revenue from our Animation business line increased 22% due to increases in revenue from our animation products 3ds Max and Maya. Net revenue growth from Advanced Systems was flat as compared to the prior fiscal year due to the migration of our Advanced Systems solutions from SGI hardware to PC based hardware systems which have a lower price but generate better margins. Fiscal 2007 Net Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2006 Net Revenue License and Other Revenue The 12% increase in net revenue during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was due to an increase in sales of new seats, an increase in the sales of subscription contracts which are recognized as maintenance revenue and an increase in crossgrade revenue. Revenue from the sale of new seats increased due to volume growth and higher average sales prices in our AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, and our 3D model based design products. In addition, the introduction of our Maya and StudioTools products resulting from the January 2006 acquisition of Alias contributed to the growth in revenue during fiscal 2007. We experienced strong growth in all three of our geographic regions and strong growth rates in the emerging economies of Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and Latin America from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from upgrades resulting primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products during fiscal 2007 compared to the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products as of the same period in the prior fiscal year. Growth in license and other revenue during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was primarily due to an increase in the sale of commercial new seats for most major products driven by our new product releases during fiscal 2007. The 19% increase in revenue from the sale of new seats from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was driven by volume growth in AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT and most major products, as well as growing sales of our 3D model based design products. These increases were partially offset by a 7% decrease in revenue from upgrades driven by the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products in fiscal 2007 compared to the size of the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products in fiscal 2006 and the success of our Subscription Program in fiscal 2006. Revenue from the sales of services, training and support are immaterial for all periods presented. Maintenance Revenue Maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program increased 54% for fiscal 2007 as compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of total net revenue, maintenance revenue was 23% for fiscal 2007 and 18% for fiscal 2006. The upgradeable installed base of the AutoCAD based products not on subscription during fiscal 2007 was smaller than the upgradeable installed base of AutoCAD based products not on subscription during fiscal 2006. As a result, overall maintenance revenue from subscriptions exceeded revenue from upgrades in fiscal 2007. Deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program. To a lesser extent, deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from Autodesk Buzzsaw and Autodesk Constructware services, consulting services and deferred license sales. Backlog from current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available license software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period. Aggregate backlog at January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006 was $395.8 million and $283.5 million, respectively, of which $17.0 million for both fiscal years related to current software license product orders which have not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year. 39 Table of Contents We rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the U.S. and international regions, including Tech Data Corporation and their affiliates, who accounted for 12% of fiscal 2007 net revenue and 11% of fiscal 2006 net revenue. Net Revenue by Geographic Area Net revenue in the Americas region increased 18% during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to strong maintenance revenue, as well as revenue from products acquired in our acquisition of Alias in January 2006 and from growth in revenue from sales of new seats driven by new product releases during fiscal 2007. Revenue from upgrades in the Americas declined by 4% during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated net revenue would have been lower by $0.3 million in fiscal 2007. Net revenue in the EMEA region increased 23% during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in the sale of new seats resulting from new product releases, combined with a strong increase in maintenance revenue and revenue from new products acquired from Alias. Revenue from upgrades in EMEA experienced a 2% decline from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. EMEAs strong growth during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to growth in the local emerging economies, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated net revenue would have been lower by $10.3 million in fiscal 2007. Net revenue in the APAC region increased 17% during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to strong growth in revenue from sales of new seats resulting from new product releases, followed by strong growth in maintenance revenue. Revenue from upgrades in APAC declined by 29% during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Net revenue growth in APAC during fiscal 2007 primarily occurred in China, South Korea, Australia and India. The increase in APAC net revenue during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year was also due to revenue from new products acquired from Alias. This revenue growth was offset by significant declines in the net revenue growth in Japan for 2D and 3D products. Had exchange rates for fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated net revenue in the APAC region would have been higher by $9.7 million in fiscal 2007. International net revenue represented 66% of our net revenue in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Net revenue in emerging economies grew by 39% from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to revenue from China, India, EMEA emerging economies and Latin America. This growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2007. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated international revenue would have been $1.0 million lower in fiscal 2007. Net Revenue by Operating Segment Net revenue for the Design Solutions Segment increased 19% during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to a 20% increase in new seat revenue and a 48% increase in maintenance from our Subscription Program. These increases were partially offset by a 6% decrease in revenue from upgrades in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program increased to 24% of Design Solutions Segment revenue during fiscal 2007 compared to 20% in fiscal 2006. Sales of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT continued to comprise a significant portion of our net revenue. Such sales, reflected in the net revenue for the Platform Solutions and Emerging Business Division and Other, represented 40% of net revenue in fiscal 2007 and 43% of consolidated net revenue in the same period of the prior fiscal year, increasing 11% in absolute dollars between the periods. Net revenue for our 3D model based design products (Autodesk Inventor products, Revit products and AutoCAD Civil 3D) increased 41% during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Total sales of 3D model based design products represented 22% of consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to 18% in fiscal 2006. 40 Table of Contents Net revenue for the Media and Entertainment Segment increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily from revenue increases in our Animation business line, from both our January 2006 acquisition of Alias and the introduction of new versions of 3ds Max and Maya products during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Although net revenue from Advanced Systems sales did not increase significantly during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, such sales progressively improved during each quarter of fiscal 2007 as a result of substantial progress made in the transition of our Advanced Systems product portfolio from SGI hardware to PC based hardware systems.

Direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold (mainly PC based workstations for Advanced Systems in the Media and Entertainment Segment in fiscal 2008, and SGI hardware for Advanced Systems in the Media and Entertainment Segment in fiscal 2007 and 2006), costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media, printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs. Cost of license and other revenue decreased 5% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due primarily to a shift in Advanced Systems from SGI hardware to PC based hardware. The increase in cost of license and other revenue during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was primarily due to higher amortization of purchased technology resulting from recent acquisitions and stock based compensation expense under SFAS 123R, which together represented 1% of revenue. Cost of maintenance revenue includes costs of sales associated with maintenance under our Subscription Program. Costs of maintenance revenue remained relatively flat during fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cost of maintenance revenue during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was due primarily to the cessation of amortization for an information technology system supporting our Subscription Program, which became fully amortized during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and which was retired from operation in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The amortization reduction was partially offset by incremental direct program costs incurred as part of the growth of our Subscription Program. Cost of revenue, at least over the near term, is affected by the volume and mix of product sales, changing consulting costs, software amortization costs, royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products, new customer support offerings and the effect of expensing employee stock based compensation expense. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. 41 Table of Contents Marketing and Sales Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2008 Increasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2007 Increasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2006 $ % $ % (in millions) Marketing and sales $ 842.7 $ 146.6 21 % $ 696.1 $ 140.1 25 % $ 556.0 As a percentage of net revenue 39 % 38 % 36 % Marketing and sales expenses include salaries, benefits and bonuses for our marketing and sales employees, travel and facility costs for our marketing, sales, dealer training and support, stock based compensation expense under SFAS 123R for stock awards granted to marketing and sales employees, labor costs of order processing, dealer and sales commissions and overhead charges. These expenses also include costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows and expositions, and various sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users. Marketing and sales expense increased 21% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to $95.5 million of higher employee related costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount and increased commissions and commission accelerators from higher revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The increase was also due to $18.5 million of increased marketing and promotion costs related to product launches, trade shows, branding, and demand generation. The increase of marketing and sales expenses during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was primarily due primarily to a $55.8 million increase in employee related costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount, $41.9 million of stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123R in fiscal 2007, and $29.6 million of increased marketing and promotion costs related to product launches, trade shows, branding, and demand generation. Marketing and sales headcount increased as a result of organic growth as well as the acquisition of Alias. We expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to develop market opportunities, to promote our competitive position and to strengthen our channel support. As a result, we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008.

Research and development expenses increased 19% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in employee related costs of $33.2 million driven by increased research and 42 Table of Contents development headcount, and an $11.6 million increase in consulting services and in process technology purchases from Hanna Strategies. Also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses was $5.5 million of in process research and development from acquisitions during fiscal 2008. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we accelerated certain internal product development initiatives that increased research and development costs. During fiscal 2008, we incurred a total of approximately $38.3 for consulting services and in process technology purchases from Hanna Strategies compared to $26.7 million in the prior year. The cost of the in process technology acquired from Hanna Strategies was immediately recognized as an expense because the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we acquired the remaining 72% ownership interest in Hanna Strategies for net consideration of $13.5 million. See Note 14, Related Parties, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this acquisition. The increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, resulted primarily from an increase in wages and salaries driven by an increase in headcount of $55.4 million and the recognition of $30.1 million of stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123R during fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we incurred a total of approximately $26.7 for consulting services and in process technology purchases from Hanna Strategies compared to $27.0 million in the prior year. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we also acquired a 28% ownership interest in Hanna Strategies for cash consideration of $12.5 million. Overall, we have increased our investment in research and development during fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year to create new products and new versions of existing products, broader interoperability, accelerated localization efforts and improvements in visualization, simulation and analysis. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, as we continue to invest in product development and acquire new technology in fiscal 2009. General and Administrative Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2008 Increasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2007 Increasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2006 $ % $ % (in millions) General and administrative $ 191.4 $ 20.3 12 % $ 171.1 $ 42.7 33 % $ 128.4 As a percentage of net revenue 9 % 9 % 8 % General and administrative expenses include salaries, benefits, and bonuses for our finance, human resources and legal personnel as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services, overhead costs, stock based compensation expense under SFAS 123R for stock awards granted to general and administrative employees, litigation costs and amortization expense of customer relationships and trademarks acquired. General and administrative expenses increased 12% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a $19.6 million increase in employee related costs, due to an increase in general and administrative headcount. The 33% increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the recognition of $16.9 million of stock based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R, and a $7.9 million increase in employee related costs, due to an increase in general and administrative headcount. General and administrative headcount increased as a result of organic growth. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. 43 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income, Net The following table sets forth the components of interest and other income, net: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Interest and investment income, net $ 33.4 $ 18.6 $ 13.2 Loss on cost method investment (5.0 ) Investment impairment (4.0 ) Loss from unconsolidated subsidiary (3.4 ) (4.3 ) Recovery of funds from an acquisition escrow account 2.2 Gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions 0.1 (0.3 ) (0.7 ) Other income 3.3 0.6 0.7 $ 24.4 $ 16.8 $ 13.2 Investment income fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances, average maturities and interest rates. The increase in interest and investment income, net, during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, reflects proportionately higher cash balances and interest rate yields during the fiscal 2008. The increase in interest and investment income, net, during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 reflects proportionately higher interest rate yields during 2007 when compared with 2006. The increase in interest and investment income, net, for fiscal 2008 was partially offset by a loss on a cost method investment and an impairment of our 28% equity investment in Hanna Strategies. Our 28% ownership interest in Hanna Strategies, accounted for under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, and FASB Interpretation No. 35, Criteria for Applying the Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, resulted in a loss from unconsolidated subsidiary representing our 28% ownership interest in Hanna Strategies results of operations through January 2, 2008, when we acquired the remaining 72%. In addition, during fiscal 2007 we also received $2.2 million recovery of funds from an escrow account established for a prior acquisition. Provision for income taxes Autodesk accounts for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse. On February 1, 2007 we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, (FIN 48) which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. Under FIN 48, companies are required to recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarified how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits, and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. The provisions of FIN 48 were effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. Based on our assessment, we recorded an increase to opening retained earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 for tax benefits not previously recognized of $26.4 million as a result of adopting FIN 48. 44 Table of Contents Our effective tax rate increased by 3% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily the result of a reduction in tax benefits, as a percentage of pre tax earnings, from the lapse of statute of limitations or audit closures and the phase out of extraterritorial income exclusion. Our effective tax rate increased by 6% from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily the result of non deductible SFAS 123R expense and a reduction in tax benefits, as a percentage of pre tax earnings, from the repatriation of certain foreign dividends at a rate lower than the 35% Federal statutory rate under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (DRD Legislation). The DRD Legislation was not available after fiscal 2006. Our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the Federal statutory rate, research credits, SFAS 123R, FIN 48, U.S. Manufacturers deduction, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, and changes in tax law. At January 31, 2008, we had net deferred tax assets of $149.4 million. Realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately $408 million of future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions. We believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets. For additional information regarding our income tax provision, see Note 3, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of cash is from the sale of our products. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs. In addition to operating expenses, we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and to invest in our growth initiatives, which include business acquisitions. See further discussion of these items below. At January 31, 2008, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaling $949.3 million and net accounts receivable of $386.5 million. In addition, we also have available a U.S. line of credit facility. This line of credit permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to $250.0 million, and is available for working capital or other business needs. The credit agreement contains customary covenants which could restrict liens, certain types of additional debt and dispositions of assets if Autodesk fails to maintain its financial covenants. Autodesk pays a quarterly commitment fee, ranging between $62,500 and $156,250, to maintain this facility. This facility expires in August 2012 and there were no borrowings outstanding at January 31, 2008. At January 31, 2008, our investment portfolio included auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of $8.4 million ($9.0 million cost basis). Autodesks auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments that have underlying securities with contractual maturities greater than ten years and interest rates that are reset at auction every 28 days. These AAA rated auction rate securities, which met Autodesks investment guidelines at the time the investments were made, have failed to settle in auctions since August 2007. The failed auctions resulted in the interest rate on these investments resetting at Libor plus 125 basis points, which represents a premium interest rate on these investments. At this time, these investments are not currently liquid, and in the event Autodesk needs to access these funds, the Company will not be able to do so without a loss of principal unless a future auction on these investments is successful. Autodesk has reduced the carrying value of these investments by $0.6 million through other comprehensive income or loss to reflect a temporary impairment on these securities. Currently, Autodesk believes these investments are temporarily impaired, but it is not clear in what period of time they will be settled. Based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments, our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, the Company has the intention and ability to 45 Table of Contents hold the securities until the value recovers or to maturity. Due to the lack of liquidity of these investments, they are included in Marketable securities non current. Autodesk will continue to evaluate its accounting for these investments on a quarterly basis. See Note 12, Financial Instruments, for further discussion of Autodesks financial instruments. Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased $131.9 million to $708.5 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of $66.5 million from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and improved working capital management. Net working capital changes were driven primarily by increases in accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities that increased cash flows from operations by $38.4 million and $26.9 million, respectively. Long term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following: development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products; financing anticipated growth; the share repurchase program; the acquisition of businesses, software products, or technologies complementary to our business; and capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal use software applications. In addition, $26.7 million of our marketable securities are held in a rabbi trust under non qualified deferred compensation plans as of January 31, 2008. See Note 4, Deferred Compensation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. To minimize the effect of these fluctuations, we use foreign currency option contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments, primarily certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency instruments, by policy, have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. The principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2008 were the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar. We monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at January 31, 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at January 31, 2008. Total FiscalYear 2009 Fiscal Years2010 2011 Fiscal Years2012 2013 Thereafter (in millions) Operating lease obligations $ 229.6 $ 61.4 $ 92.5 $ 50.9 $ 24.8 Purchase obligations 39.0 39.0 Total(1)(2) $ 268.6 $ 100.4 $ 92.5 $ 50.9 $ 24.8 (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet or certain purchase obligations as discussed below. (2) The table also excludes our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48, which totaled $152.4 million as of January 31, 2008, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities. See Note 3 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Autodesk and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. 46 Table of Contents Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies, services and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies, services or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, in most instances, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. In addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, included in cost of license and other revenue, was $14.9 million in fiscal 2008, $16.8 million in fiscal 2007, $12.1 million in fiscal 2006. Principal commitments at January 31, 2008 shown above consist of obligations under operating leases for facilities and computer equipment, IT infrastructure costs, marketing costs and contractual development costs. Purchase commitments also include $24.5 million related to a termination fee for an outsource application hosting services agreement entered into during fiscal 2006. This fee is reduced as time elapses during the five year contract period. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. We provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. Historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities. As of January 31, 2008 we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Stock Compensation As of January 31, 2008, we maintained two active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and non employee members of Autodesks Board of Directors (Board): the 2006 Employee Stock Plan (2006 Plan), which is available only to employees, and the 2000 Directors Option Plan, as amended (2000 Plan), which is available only to non employee directors. Additionally, there are seven expired or terminated plans with options outstanding, including the 1996 Stock Plan which was replaced by the 2006 Employee Stock Plan in March 2006. The 2006 Plan, which was approved by Autodesks stockholders on November 10, 2005, reserved 9.65 million shares of Autodesk common stock plus 0.22 million shares that remained available for issuance under the 1996 Stock Plan upon its expiration, for issuance under the plan. At January 31, 2008, 2.5 million shares were available for future issuance under this plan. The 2006 Plan expires in March 2008. The 2000 Plan, which was originally approved by the stockholders in June 2000, allows for an automatic annual grant of options to non employee members of Autodesks Board of Directors. At January 31, 2008, 0.31 million shares were available for future issuance. The 2000 Plan will expire in March 2010. 47 Table of Contents On November 6, 2007, Autodesks stockholders approved a new stock plan, the 2008 Employee Stock Plan (the 2008 Plan), to become effective in March 2008 upon the expiration of the 2006 Plan. The 2008 Plan reserves 16.5 million shares of Autodesk common stock, plus 0.48 million shares that remained available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Plan upon its expiration, for issuance under that plan. The 2008 Plan will permit the grant of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units; however, no more than 2.5 million of the shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 Plan may be issued for awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units. The 2008 Plan will expire in March 2011. Our stock option program is broad based and designed to promote long term retention. Essentially all of our employees participate. Approximately 94% of the options we granted during fiscal 2008 were awarded to employees other than our CEO, CFO and the three other most highly compensated officers for fiscal 2008, which we refer to as our Named Executive Officers. Options granted under our equity plans during fiscal 2008 vest over periods ranging from one to four years and expire within six to ten years of the date of grant. Since March 2005, the exercise price of all stock options granted is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date. All stock option grants to executive officers are made by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. All members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee are independent directors, as defined by the listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Grants to our non employee directors are non discretionary and are pre determined by the terms of the 2000 Plan. For further information concerning Autodesks policies and procedures regarding the use of stock options, see Compensation Discussion and Analysis incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled Executive Compensation, in our Proxy Statement for our fiscal year 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission not later than 120 days after the fiscal year ended January 31, 2008. In addition to our stock option plans, our employees are also eligible to participate in Autodesks 1998 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (ESP Plan). Eligible employees may purchase shares of Autodesks common stock at their discretion using up to 15% of their compensation subject to certain limitations, at not less than 85% of fair market value as defined in the plan agreement. At January 31, 2008, 22.1 million shares were available for future issuance. This amount will automatically be increased on the first trading day of each fiscal year by an amount equal to the lesser of 10.0 million shares or 2.0% of the total outstanding shares plus any shares repurchased by Autodesk during the prior fiscal year. We typically issue shares on March 31 and September 30 of each fiscal year. The provisions of this plan expire during fiscal 2018. On August 17, 2006, Autodesk disclosed that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors was conducting a voluntary review of Autodesks historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues. Due to this review, Autodesk was not current with its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 until June 2007, and suspended contributions and purchases under the ESP Plan during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the first quarter of fiscal 2008. On September 18, 2006, Autodesks Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Companys ESP Plan which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period, unless they elected not to participate. The Board of Directors also approved a one time cash bonus of $8.8 million to non executive employees enrolled in the ESP Plan at that date. This bonus approximated the profits employee participants would have made on the scheduled September 30, 2006 exercise date, had the purchases been made and the shares been sold on the next trading day at close of market, and was expensed as additional compensation expense at the time it was paid. On March 22, 2007, Autodesks Board of Directors approved an amendment, which superseded the September 18, 2006 amendment, which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period ending in September 2007, unless they elected not to participate. In June 2007 the Company became current with its financial filings and resumed employee contributions to the ESP Plan. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our revenue, earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations, but such contracts do not extend beyond the current quarter. Contracts are primarily denominated in euros, British pounds, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, and Canadian dollars. We do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Autodesk utilizes foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions. A sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of January 31, 2008 indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2008 would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $3.9 million. A hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at January 31, 2008 would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $2.8 million. The results of the sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of January 31, 2007 indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2007 would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $0.4 million and a hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at January 31, 2007 would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $0.9 million. We do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts. Interest rate sensitivity At January 31, 2008, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of $31.4 million. These securities were not subject to interest rate fluctuations. At January 31, 2007, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of $112.0 million. These securities were also not subject to interest rate fluctuations. The short term mutual fund balances included $26.7 million at January 31, 2008 and $27.2 million at January 31, 2007 of amounts held in a rabbi trust under deferred compensation arrangements. See Note 4, Deferred Compensation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk. We place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy guidelines, which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument. 49 Table of Contents
