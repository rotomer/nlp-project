ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion in our MD&A contains trend analyses and other forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements are any statements that look to future events and consist of, among other things, our business strategies, anticipated future operating results, including net revenue, operating margins, product backlog, upgrade, crossgrade and maintenance revenue, the impact of our restructuring activities, the impact of acquisitions and investment activities, the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on net revenue and expenses, costs and expenses, including cost of revenue and operating expenses, future income, our anticipated tax rate, and our ability to successfully expand our 2D horizontal customer base to our 2D vertical products and 3D model based design products. In addition, forward looking statements also consist of statements involving expectations regarding product acceptance, continuation of our stock repurchase program, and short term and long term cash requirements, as well as, statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as may, believe, could, anticipate, would, might, plan, expect, and similar expressions or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and are subject to business and economic risks. As such, our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth above in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made. Strategy Our goal is to be the worlds leading 2D and 3D design and engineering software and services company for the architecture, engineering, and construction, manufacturing, geospatial mapping, and digital media and entertainment markets. Worldwide business trends such as globalization, sustainability, investment in infrastructure, and the increasing desire to keep data digital, are creating pressure on our customers to improve innovation while enhancing productivity. We offer our customers the ability to visualize and simulate real world performance early in the design process through digital prototyping to foster innovation, enhance quality, and save time and money for competitive advantage. Our customers are seeking differentiation through design, and we believe our products provide a competitive advantage to succeed in this environment. We believe that our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages. By innovating in existing technology categories, we bring powerful design products to volume markets. Our products are designed to be easy to learn and use, and to provide customers low cost of deployment, low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment. In addition, our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products. We believe that our technological leadership, brand recognition, breadth of product line and large installed base will help us weather the economic storm and position us well for an eventual recovery. We have created a large global community of distributors and resellers, third party developers and customers. These relationships provide us with a broad reach into volume markets. Our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and cost efficient training services. We believe the strength of our channel will help us maintain our leadership throughout the economic downturn. The overall health of our channel partners remains vitally important to us. We have an active partner assistance program in place on a global basis, and we will continue to work closely with our partners in a collaborative effort to fight through the current economic downturn. We have a significant number of registered third party developers that create products that operate with our software products, further extending our reach into volume markets. Users trained on our products are broadly available both from educational institutions and the existing work force, reducing the cost of training for our customers. To train the next generation of users, we offer education programs, including classroom support, standardized curricula, instructor development, and specially priced software purchasing options. 28 Table of Contents Our growth strategy derives from these core strengths. We continue to increase the business value of our design tools in a number of ways. We improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release. Our most recent product release commenced in March 2009. Beyond our 2D horizontal design products, we develop products addressing industry specific needs including 2D vertical and 3D model based products. We continually strive to improve our product functionality and specialization by industry while increasing product interoperability and usability. We are also considering innovative ways of delivering better user experiences to the customers we serve. As a result, we drive technology democratization and increase customer loyalty. In addition, we believe that expanding our 2D horizontal product customers portfolios to include our 2D vertical products and 3D model based design products presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy. For fiscal 2009, revenue from 3D model based design products increased 23%, including a 38% increase in related maintenance revenue, as compared to the prior fiscal year. We shipped approximately 142,000 commercial seats (which includes new seats and crossgrade seats) of 3D model based design products, including approximately 37,000 seats of Autodesk Inventor and Autodesk Moldflow, and approximately 105,000 seats of our Architecture, Engineering and Construction products (Autodesk Revit, AutoCAD Civil 3D, Autodesk Navisworks and Autodesk Robobat). We expect that the adoption of 2D vertical products and 3D model based design products will increase the productivity of our customers in all industries and result in richer design data. This migration also poses various risks to us. In particular, if we do not successfully expand our 2D horizontal customer base to our 2D vertical products and 3D model based design products as expected, then we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected. Expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy. We believe that emerging economies continue to present long term growth opportunities for us, although revenue from emerging economies declined 31% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. For all of fiscal 2009, revenue from emerging economies increased 14% as compared to fiscal 2008. Revenue from emerging economies represented 18% of fiscal 2009 net revenue as compared to 17% of fiscal 2008 net revenue. While we believe there are long term growth opportunities in emerging economies, conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges, including the current economic contraction in those countries, intellectual property protection and software piracy. Our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology and businesses. Acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers; however, they entail integration challenges and may, in certain instances, negatively impact our operating margins. We continually review these trade offs in making our decisions of whether to make acquisitions. The size and frequency of transactions to acquire products, technology and businesses increased during fiscal 2009 and the second half of fiscal 2008 as compared to earlier periods. We currently anticipate that we will selectively acquire products, technology and businesses as compelling opportunities that promote our strategy become available, but the pace at which we make such investments will vary depending upon our business needs, the availability of suitable sellers and technology, and our own financial condition. Global economic conditions deteriorated significantly during our fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. Economic contraction in most countries and markets, and global financial market instability, including tighter credit, is adversely impacting our business. We have seen demand for our products and services decline in each of our major geographies and all the industries we serve, particularly during our most recent fiscal quarter that ended on January 31, 2009. We have taken, and continue to take, actions to address these global economic changes and how they are affecting our financial condition. Our strategy remains focused on leveraging our core strengths and investing in our long term growth opportunities to achieve our goal of being the worlds leading 2D and 3D design and engineering software and services company for the architecture, engineering, and construction, manufacturing, geospatial mapping, and digital media and entertainment markets. 29 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We regularly reevaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. Our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with Statement of Position 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For multiple element arrangements that include software products, we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method, under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value. VSOE is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority. If we do not have VSOE of the undelivered element, we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have VSOE are delivered. We are required to exercise judgment in determining whether VSOE exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent. Our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition. If we do not believe that collection is probable, the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received. Our indirect channel model includes both a two tiered distribution structure, where distributors sell to resellers, and a one tiered structure where Autodesk sells directly to resellers. Our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor, in a two tiered structure, or reseller, in a one tiered structure, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. This policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria. We are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. Our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Product Returns Reserves. We permit our distributors and resellers to return products up to a percentage of prior quarter purchases. The product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns, estimated channel inventory levels, the timing of new product introductions and promotions, channel sell in for applicable markets and other factors. Our product returns reserves were $12.5 million at January 31, 2009 and $14.4 million at January 31, 2008. Product returns as a percentage of applicable revenue were 5.2% in fiscal 2009, 3.5% in fiscal 2008 and 3.9% in fiscal 2007. During fiscal year 2009 and 2008, we recorded additions to our product returns reserves of $52.5 million and $46.8 million, respectively, which reduced our revenue. 30 Table of Contents Marketable Securities. At January 31, 2009 we had $71.1 million of short and long term marketable securities. We review our investments in marketable securities quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this determination, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the sponsor, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income. This impairment results in a new cost basis in the investment recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. If market, industry, and or sponsor conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Determining the fair value of marketable securities that are not actively traded requires significant judgment. We recorded a $4.5 million impairment charge during fiscal 2009. This impairment related to investments in two money market funds: The Reserve International Liquidity Fund (the International Fund) and The Reserve Primary Fund (the Primary Fund, and together with the International Fund, the Reserve Funds). We believe this impairment charge is other than temporary; therefore, we recorded the amount as an expense under Interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The impairment occurred as a result of the Reserve Funds revaluing their holdings of debt securities issued by Lehman Brothers, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the Reserve Funds. Certain past and future distributions from the Reserve Funds are currently under dispute by fund investors and the actual amount of the loss on these investments is uncertain at this time. The cost basis of our investment in the Reserve Funds immediately prior to September 15, 2008 was $112.8 million; we received $75.0 million in distributions from the Reserve Funds during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009. As of January 31, 2009, the cost basis of amounts still invested in the Reserve Funds by us and awaiting distribution was approximately $37.8 million. We believe we will receive substantially all of our remaining investment balance within the next twelve months; therefore, these assets are classified as current in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, at January 31, 2009, we had auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of $7.6 million ($9.0 million cost basis) included in non current Marketable securities due to their lack of liquidity. We determined that these securities are other than temporarily impaired, and we recorded a $1.4 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. See further discussion of these Reserve Fund and auction rate securities in Liquidity and Capital Resources section below. Goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. When assessing goodwill for impairment, we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired, or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges. We recorded an impairment charge of approximately $128.2 million affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 representing the entire goodwill balance associated with our Media and Entertainment (M&E) segment as of October 31, 2008. During the fourth quarter, revenue and cash flow projections for all segments were substantially impacted by the sharp downturn in the global economy and in our business. The M&E segment was the only segment which had a current fair value of its future discounted cash flows that fell below the carrying value of its assets. Should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future, additional impairment charges may be recorded on goodwill. See further discussion of this impairment charge in Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents Realizability of Long Lived Assets. We assess the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. We consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget; shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and the results of past impairment reviews. In assessing the recoverability of these long lived assets, we first determine their fair values, which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets. If impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models, which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows, we discounted the cash flows to assess impairments on long lived assets. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values. In addition to our recoverability assessments, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters. We will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges. Income Taxes. We currently have $133.7 million of net deferred tax assets, mostly arising from tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, purchased technologies and capitalized software, partially offset by the establishment of U.S. deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and acquired intangibles. We perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors. These changes, if any, may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 revised 2004, Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for employee stock awards. This model requires the input of assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate of each award. The parameters used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted, as needed. Compensation expense for employee stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award. Legal Contingencies. As described in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Part II, Item 8, Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings. We routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. Because of inherent 32 Table of Contents uncertainties related to these legal matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporation herein by reference. Overview of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31, 2009 As a % of NetRevenue Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31, 2008 As a % of NetRevenue (in millions) Net Revenue $ 2,315.2 100 % $ 2,171.9 100 % Cost of revenue 219.1 9 % 207.7 10 % Gross Profit 2,096.1 91 % 1,964.2 90 % Operating expenses 1,851.6 80 % 1,518.6 70 % Income from Operations $ 244.5 11 % $ 445.6 20 % During fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, net revenue increased 7%, gross profit increased 7% and income from operations decreased 45%. We expect net revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal 2010 as a result of adverse economic pressures on our customers. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 we experienced a dramatic change in the economic conditions of our markets globally. The first two quarters of fiscal 2009 were characterized by net revenue growth of 18% over the same period in the prior fiscal year and we reported an increase in income from operations of 20% for that six month period, which was only slightly lower compared to the same period of the prior year as a result of our acquisition activity during the first six months of fiscal 2009. Due to the deteriorating global economic conditions during our third and fourth fiscal quarters, our results for the second half of fiscal 2009 were a stark contrast to the first half of the fiscal year. Revenue for the second half of fiscal 2009 declined by 4% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year; revenue decreased sequentially 2% and 19% during our third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, respectively. Income from operations for the second half of fiscal 2009 was approximately break even compared to a positive 20% operating margin for the second half of fiscal 2008; the third quarter fiscal 2009 positive operating margin of approximately 23% was offset by a 27% negative operating margin in the fourth quarter fiscal 2009 due primarily to a goodwill and intangibles impairment charge of $128.9 million, and a restructuring charge of $40.2 million. Our primary goals for fiscal 2009 were to continue delivering our market leading products and solutions to our customers, to drive revenue growth, and to invest in product functionality and new product lines while minimizing the impact of these investments on gross profit, operating margins and operating cash flow. Due primarily to the deterioration of the economy during the second half of the year, we were unable to achieve our revenue, operating margin and net income goals. In January 2009 we announced a restructuring plan to reduce headcount by approximately 10% and to consolidate certain facilities around the world in order to reduce our operating expenses. See further discussion of our restructuring plan in Note 14, Restructuring Reserves of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We are taking other actions in an attempt to stimulate demand and align our cost structure with the reality of our recent and anticipated financial results, including a hiring freeze, travel restrictions and other expense initiatives. In taking these actions, we may incur additional costs which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities. 33 Table of Contents The 45% decrease in income from operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to goodwill and intangibles impairment charges of $128.9 million, or 29 percentage points of the 45% decrease, affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, principally associated with our M&E segment, and a restructuring charge of $40.2 million, or 9 percentage points of the 45% decrease, as well as the impact of in process research and development expenses and intangibles amortization from our acquisition activity. Net revenue for fiscal 2009 increased by 7% as compared to fiscal 2008 due to a 29% increase in maintenance revenue, slightly offset by a 1% decrease in license and other revenue. Net revenue for our 3D model based design products increased 23%, while net revenue from our 2D products remained flat during fiscal 2009, as compared to the prior fiscal year. A critical component of our growth strategy is to continue to add new 2D horizontal users, while expanding our customers portfolios to include our higher value 2D vertical and 3D model based design products. For fiscal 2009 we experienced growth in net revenue in Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific (APAC). We generate a significant amount of our revenue in the United States, and in countries outside the United States such as Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Russian Federation, Canada, South Korea, China and Australia. We benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies in the first three quarters of fiscal 2009; the trend reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 with the U.S. dollar strengthening against most currencies. The weaker value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies for the majority of fiscal 2009 had a positive effect of $56 million on operating income in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Had exchange rates from fiscal 2008 been in effect during fiscal 2009 (on a constant currency basis), translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been $79 million lower and operating expenses would have been $23 million lower. This represents a 4% increase in net revenue and a 2% decrease in income from operations on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue and income from operations in future periods. We use foreign currency forward and option collar contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions. Our total operating margin decreased from 21% of net revenue in fiscal 2008 to 11% in fiscal 2009. This decrease is primarily due to the goodwill and intangibles impairment charge and the restructuring charge discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by a net revenue increase of 7%. Even in these challenging economic times, we will continue to invest in growth and productivity initiatives so that we will be better positioned for growth when the economy improves. Over the longer term we intend to continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our goal of increasing our operating margins. Our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenue, given the relatively fixed nature of most of our expenses, which consist primarily of employee related expenditures, facilities costs, and depreciation and amortization expense. For fiscal 2010, we expect total costs and expenses to decrease in absolute dollars as we continue to work on finding ways to align our cost structure with our current financial condition, and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. However, there can be no assurance that our cost structure will not increase in the future or that we will be able to align our cost structure with our expected actual financial results. In addition, in taking these actions, we may incur additional costs which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect that our net income will be negative. Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $593.9 million for fiscal 2009 was primarily comprised of net income and the net effect of non cash expenses associated with stock based compensation, the impairment of goodwill and intangibles, primarily related to our M&E segment, as well as restructuring charges. We expect net cash flows provided by operating activities to be negative in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of lower revenue combined with cash expenditures in the quarter for payments of the annual employee incentive plan and payments related to our restructuring plan. 34 Table of Contents We rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the U.S. and international regions, including Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates (Tech Data). Tech Data accounted for 14%, 14% and 12% of Autodesks consolidated net revenue for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We finished fiscal 2009 with $988.7 million in cash and marketable securities of which $7.6 million is classified as long term. This is an increase from the $957.7 million balance at January 31, 2008. We had a $50.0 million draw outstanding on our $250.0 million available U.S. line of credit at January 31, 2009. We finished fiscal 2009 with $593.9 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $708.5 million during the previous fiscal year. Operating cash flows declined primarily due to the significant decrease in net income and a reduction of accrued bonuses and commissions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect cash flow from operating activities to be negative as a result of lower revenue combined with cash outlays in the quarter for payments of the annual employee incentive plan and payments relating to the restructuring plan. In fiscal 2009 we purchased 8.0 million shares of our common stock for $256.6 million, and continued to invest in our business through acquisitions, and investments in other growth initiatives. Comparatively, during the prior fiscal year we repurchased 12.1 million shares of our common stock for $563.0 million and also completed several acquisitions. We completed fiscal 2009 with a higher deferred revenue balance and lower accounts receivable balance as compared to the previous fiscal year. Our deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2009 included $475.0 million of customer maintenance contracts related to our maintenance program, which will be recognized as maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the contracts, which is predominantly one year.

Product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seat licenses, revenue from the Autodesk upgrade program and revenue from the Autodesk crossgrade program. Other revenue consists of revenue from consulting and training services, revenue from the Autodesk Developers Network, Autodesk Collaborative Solution hosting revenue, revenue from Autodesks former Location Services division and revenue from Advanced Systems product support. We divested the Location Services division in February 2009, and we do not expect further revenue to be received from it (see Note 15, Subsequent Events, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). Total license and other revenue decreased 1% during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. Commercial new seat revenue from our 3D model based design products and 2D products for fiscal 2009 was flat compared to fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009, we experienced a decrease of approximately 13 percentage points due to lower number of seat licenses sold, offset by an increase of approximately 13 percentage points due to higher average net revenue per seat. During fiscal 2009, there was less correlation between revenue growth and seat license growth due to changes in our mix of geographies and products, proportion of maintenance in the user base, currency exchange rates, and average selling prices, and we expect this trend to continue. As a percentage of total net revenue, license and other revenue was 69% for fiscal 2009, 75% for fiscal 2008, and 77% for fiscal 2007. We expect license and other revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as a result of adverse economic pressures on our customers. Upgrade revenue, which includes crossgrade revenue, decreased by 8% during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, as expected. The decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products in fiscal 2009 as compared to the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products in fiscal 2008, due to more customers on our maintenance program. Over the long term, we expect revenue from upgrades to decrease as we continue to move customers onto our maintenance program. Revenue from the sales of our services, training and support, included in License and other, represented less than 4% of net revenue for all periods presented. Maintenance Revenue Under our maintenance program, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available, downloadable training courses and online support. We recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods. Maintenance revenue increased 29% for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Approximately 20 percentage points of the 29% increase was due to increases in program enrollment and approximately 9 percentage points of the increase was due to higher net revenue per maintenance seat for fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of total net revenue, maintenance revenue was 31% for fiscal 2009, 25% for fiscal 2008, and 23% for fiscal 2007. Our maintenance program, available to most customers worldwide, continues to provide a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of upgrades and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts. We expect maintenance revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal 2010 as a result of decreased program enrollment from declines in new product sales as well as maintenance attach and renewal rates. At January 31, 2009 our maintenance program enrollment consisted of about 1.7 million users. Aggregate backlog at January 31, 2009 and January 31, 2008 was $569.5 million and $521.5 million, respectively, of which $552.1 million and $506.1 million, respectively, represented deferred revenue and $17.4 million and $15.4 million, respectively, related to current software license product orders that had not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year. Deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue. 36 Table of Contents To a lesser extent, deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from collaborative project management services, consulting services and deferred license sales. Backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period. Net Revenue by Geographic Area Net revenue in the Americas region decreased by 3% during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, as a result of a 15% decrease in revenue from new seats in the Americas and a 19% decrease in revenue from upgrades, offset in part by a 16% increase in maintenance revenue. Growth in the Americas was affected by a slowing economy that impacted growth rates for all of our products in fiscal 2009. Net revenue in EMEA increased by 15%, or 9% on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a 39% increase in maintenance revenue and a 6% increase in new seat revenue, slightly offset by a 1% decrease in revenue from upgrades. EMEAs growth during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to growth in the EMEA emerging economies, as well as in Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium and Sweden. The positive effect of the weaker value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, the British pound and other European currencies also contributed to the increase in net revenue in EMEA. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2008 been in effect during fiscal 2009, translated net revenue in EMEA would have been $53 million lower in fiscal 2009. Net revenue in APAC increased by 7%, or 2% on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a 36% increase in maintenance revenue and a 3% increase in new seat revenue, partially offset by a 4% decrease in revenue from upgrades. Net revenue growth in APAC during fiscal 2009 occurred primarily due to growth in Japan and Australia; net revenue from APAC emerging economies in fiscal 2009 was flat compared to the prior fiscal year. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2008 been in effect during fiscal 2009, translated net revenue in APAC would have been $27 million lower in fiscal 2009. We believe that international net revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue. International net revenue represented 72% of our net revenue in fiscal 2009 and 69% of our net revenue in fiscal 2008. We started to experience some economic difficulty in international sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Global conditions have worsened since then, and the economic downturn significantly impacted our international sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, particularly the robust business we had been seeing in emerging economies. Net revenue in emerging economies grew by 14% from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, primarily due to revenue from the Russian Federation, other EMEA emerging economies and India. This growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2009. In contrast, fourth quarter fiscal 2009 net revenue in the EMEA and APAC regions decreased 16% and 25%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, and net revenue from emerging economies declined 31% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Further economic weakness in any of the countries that contributes a significant portion of our net revenue could have an even greater adverse effect on our business in those countries. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could also significantly affect our future financial results for a given period. Net Revenue by Operating Segment Net revenue for PSEB increased 2% during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a 3% increase in revenue from AutoCAD LT, partially offset by a 1% decrease in revenue from AutoCAD. Net revenue for AEC increased 9% during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a 22% increase in revenue from Autodesk Revit. This increase was partially offset by a 13% decrease in revenue from AutoCAD Architecture. Also contributing to the increase in AECs net revenue during fiscal 2009 was an increase in revenue from the Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis (Robobat) and Autodesk Navisworks products. 37 Table of Contents Net revenue for MSD increased 17% during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an 8% increase in revenue from Autodesk Inventor products and a 12% increase in revenue from AutoCAD Mechanical. Contributing 7 percentage points of the 17% increase in MSDs net revenue for fiscal 2009 was revenue from the Autodesk Moldflow products of $30.8 million. Net revenue for M&E increased 1% during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a 9% increase in net revenue from our Animation product group. The increase in Animation revenue was primarily due to a 25% increase in revenue from Autodesk 3ds Max. Net revenue from Advanced Systems decreased 8% during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Net Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2007 Net Revenue License and Other Revenue Growth in license and other revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to growth in new seat revenue for most major products driven by the release of our 2008 family of products. Total license and other revenue increased 14% for fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This growth was primarily due to a 20% increase in commercial new seat revenue from our 2D products and 3D model based design products. This 20% increase largely was driven by the release of our 2008 family of products. Slightly less than 13 percentage points of the 20% increase was due to higher average revenue per seat and approximately 7 percentage points of the 20% increase was due to increases in the number of seats sold. As a percentage of total net revenue, license and other revenue was 75% for fiscal 2008, 77% for fiscal 2007 and 82% for fiscal 2006. Revenue from the sale of new seats increased 19% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. The increase is due to an 18% increase in revenue from new seats of our 2D products, primarily AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD, AutoCAD Mechanical and AutoCAD Architecture. The increase was also due to a 30% increase in revenue from new seats of our 3D model based design products (Autodesk Revit products, Autodesk Inventor products, AutoCAD Civil 3D, and Autodesk Navisworks software). The increase in new seat revenue was driven primarily by higher average net revenue per seat and volume growth in both our 2D design and 3D model based design products. The positive effect of the weaker value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies also contributed to the increase in total net revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. In addition, we experienced growth in net revenue in all three of our geographic regions and strong growth in the emerging economies of EMEA and APAC. Upgrade revenue, which includes crossgrade revenue, decreased by 17% during fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as expected. The decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products in fiscal 2008 as compared to the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products in fiscal 2007, due to more customers on our maintenance program. In addition, during the second half of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, AutoCAD LT customers could crossgrade to any other product at a promotional rate, which contributed approximately $9.1 million to upgrade revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to $21.4 million in fiscal 2007. Maintenance Revenue Maintenance revenue increased 31% for fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of total net revenue, maintenance revenue was 25% for fiscal 2008, 23% for fiscal 2007, and 18% for fiscal 2006. Due to the increase in our maintenance base over time, the relative upgradeable installed base of the AutoCAD based products not on maintenance during fiscal 2008 was smaller than the upgradeable installed base of the AutoCAD based products not on maintenance during fiscal 2007. 38 Table of Contents Aggregate backlog at January 31, 2008 and January 31, 2007 was $521.5 million and $395.8 million, respectively, of which $506.1 million and $378.8 million represented deferred revenue and $15.4 million and $17.0 million, respectively, related to current software license product orders which have not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year. Net Revenue by Geographic Area Net revenue in the Americas region increased by 9% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a 22% increase in maintenance revenue. Revenue from new seats in the Americas increased 2% during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 driven by new seat revenue from our 3D model based design products offset by a decline in new seat revenue from our 2D products compared to the prior fiscal year. Revenue from upgrades decreased by 14% in the Americas during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year. Growth in the Americas was also impacted by a slowing economy that impacted growth rates for all of our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008, translated net revenue in the Americas would have been $0.1 million lower in fiscal 2008. Net revenue in EMEA increased by 27% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a 37% increase in new seat revenue and 40% increase in maintenance revenue. Revenue from new seats in EMEA increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 driven by new seat revenue from our 2D design products and 3D model based design products. These increases were partially offset by 24% decrease in revenue from upgrades. EMEAs growth during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to growth in the EMEA emerging economies, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Belgium and Austria. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008, translated net revenue in EMEA would have been $66.7 million lower in fiscal 2008. Net revenue in APAC increased 18% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to an 18% increase in new seats revenue, a 32% increase in maintenance revenue, and a 9% increase in revenue from upgrades. Revenue from new seats in APAC increased due to strong new seat revenue from our 2D products and 3D model based design products. Net revenue growth in APAC during fiscal 2008 occurred primarily due to growth in the APAC emerging economies, Japan, South Korea and Australia. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008, translated net revenue in APAC would have been $4.4 million lower in fiscal 2008. International net revenue represented 69% of our net revenue in fiscal 2008 and 66% of our net revenue in fiscal 2007. Net revenue in emerging economies grew by 40% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to revenue from the EMEA emerging economies, China and India. This growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2008. Net Revenue by Operating Segment Net revenue for PSEB increased 13% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a 24% increase in revenue from AutoCAD LT and a 6% increase in revenue from AutoCAD. Net revenue for AEC increased 26% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a 40% increase in revenue from Autodesk Revit, a 24% increase in revenue from AutoCAD Civil 3D and a 9% increase in revenue from AutoCAD Architecture. Net revenue for MSD increased 25% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to a 17% increase in revenue from Autodesk Inventor products and a 28% increase in revenue from AutoCAD Mechanical. Net revenue for M&E increased 10% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, net revenue from our Animation product group increased 22% due to increases in revenue from our animation products 3ds Max and Maya. Net revenue growth from Advanced Systems was flat as compared to the prior fiscal year due to the migration of our Advanced Systems solutions from Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) hardware to PC based hardware systems which have a lower price but generate better margins. 39 Table of Contents Cost of Revenue Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2009 Increase (decrease)compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2008 Increase (decrease)compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2007 $ % $ % (in millions) Cost of revenue: License and other $ 210.2 $ 11.1 6 % $ 199.1 $ (9.9 ) 5 % $ 209.0 Maintenance 8.9 0.3 3 % 8.6 (0.1 ) 1 % 8.7 $ 219.1 $ 11.4 5 % $ 207.7 $ (10.0 ) 5 % $ 217.7 As a percentage of net revenue 9 % 10 % 12 % Cost of license and other revenue includes direct material and overhead charges, labor costs of fulfilling service contracts and order processing, including stock based compensation expense for these employees, royalties and amortization of purchased technology. Direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold (mainly PC based workstations for Advanced Systems in the M&E segment), costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media, printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs. Cost of license and other revenue increased 6% during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008 even though license and other revenue decreased by 1%. Cost of license and other revenue increased in fiscal 2009 due to an increase in amortization of purchased technology due to the number of acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2009 and 2008, slightly offset by decreases in employee related expenses. Since many of these costs are headcount related expenses, they do not vary proportionally with changes in revenue. Cost of license and other revenue decreased 5% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, due primarily to a shift in Advanced Systems from SGI hardware to PC based hardware. Cost of maintenance revenue includes costs of sales associated with our maintenance program. Costs of maintenance revenue remained relatively consistent in both relative dollars and as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Costs of maintenance revenue remained relatively consistent in both relative dollars and as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. Cost of revenue, at least over the near term, is affected by the volume and mix of product sales, changing consulting costs, software amortization costs, royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products, new customer support offerings and the effect of expensing employee stock based compensation expense. We expect cost of revenue to decline in absolute dollars during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, with decreases in revenue as we continue to find ways to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition, and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009.

Marketing and sales expenses also include travel and facility costs for our marketing, sales, dealer training and order support personnel, sales and dealer commissions, labor costs of sales order processing, and overhead charges. 40 Table of Contents Marketing and sales expense increased 6% during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to $55.0 million of higher employee related costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Marketing and sales expense increased 21% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to $95.5 million of higher employee related costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount and increased commissions and commission accelerators from higher revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The increase was also due to $18.5 million of increased marketing and promotion costs related to product launches, trade shows, branding, and demand generation. We expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to develop market opportunities, to promote our competitive position and to strengthen our channel support, but at a slower pace. We expect marketing and sales expense to decrease in absolute dollars during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as we continue to find ways to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition, and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009.

Research and development expenses increased 17% during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an increase in employee related costs of $63.8 million driven by increased research and development headcount. Also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses was $26.9 million of in process research and development from acquisitions during fiscal 2009. These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 million reduction in stock based compensation expense for our research and development employees. Research and development expenses increased 19% during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in employee related costs of $33.2 million driven by increased research and development headcount, and an $11.6 million increase in consulting services and in process technology purchases from Hanna Strategies. Also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses was $5.5 million of in process research and development from acquisitions during fiscal 2008. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we accelerated certain internal product development initiatives that increased research and development costs. Overall, we increased our investment in research and development during fiscal 2009 as compared to the prior fiscal year to create new products and new versions of existing products, broader interoperability, accelerated localization efforts and improvements in visualization, simulation and analysis. We expect research and development expense to decrease in absolute dollars during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, as we continue to find ways to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition, and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. 41 Table of Contents During fiscal 2008, we incurred a total of approximately $38.3 million for consulting services and in process technology purchases from Hanna Strategies compared to $26.7 million in fiscal 2007. The cost of the in process technology acquired from Hanna Strategies was immediately recognized as an expense because the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we acquired the remaining 72% ownership interest in Hanna Strategies for net consideration of $13.5 million. See Note 13, Business Combinations, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this acquisition.

General and administrative expenses increased 14% from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a $12.7 million increase in employee related costs, due to an increase in general and administrative headcount, and a $14.1 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2009. General and administrative expenses increased 12% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a $19.6 million increase in employee related costs, due to an increase in general and administrative headcount. We expect general and administrative expense to decrease in absolute dollars during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, as we continue to find ways to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition, and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009.

During the three months ended January 31, 2009, revenue and cash flow projections for all segments decreased substantially as the economy worsened. The M&E segment was the only segment which had a current fair value that fell below the carrying value of its assets. Should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future, additional impairment charges may be recorded on goodwill.

This program will reduce the number of employees by a total of approximately 750 full time positions globally and will result in the consolidation of up to 27 leased facilities. In connection with this restructuring plan, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $40.2 million related to one time termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 620 of these full time positions globally, and we began the consolidation of nine leased facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Charges associated with these one time termination benefits and consolidation of leased facilities have been recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. As of January 31, 2009, $1.3 million was paid. The remaining accrual associated with the termination benefits is expected to be substantially paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In the first half of fiscal 2010, we expect to record approximately $15 million to $20 million primarily related to one time employee severance arrangements for the elimination of approximately 130 full time positions globally, and approximately $10 million to $15 million related to the consolidation of leased facilities. We expect to pay the facility related liabilities through fiscal 2018. If our revenue should continue to decline significantly we will look to further reduce our operating expenses to align them with our financial condition, including the possibility of a further restructuring. In taking these actions, we may incur additional costs which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities. See Note 14, Restructuring Reserves, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and Other Income, Net The following table sets forth the components of interest and other income, net: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Interest and investment income, net $ 13.6 $ 33.4 $ 18.6 Investment impairment (5.9 ) (4.0 ) Loss on cost method investment (5.0 ) Loss from unconsolidated subsidiary (3.4 ) (4.3 ) Other income 0.3 3.4 2.5 $ 8.0 $ 24.4 $ 16.8 Interest and investment income, net fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances, average maturities and interest rates. The decrease in interest and investment income, net, during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, is primarily due to lower interest rate yields. The increase in interest and investment income, net, during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, reflects proportionately higher cash balances and interest rate yields during fiscal 2008. The increase in interest and investment income, net, for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was partially offset by a loss on a cost method investment and an impairment of our historical 28% equity investment in Hanna Strategies. 43 Table of Contents Our historical 28% ownership interest in Hanna Strategies, accounted for under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, and FASB Interpretation No. 35, Criteria for Applying the Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, resulted in a loss from unconsolidated subsidiary representing our 28% ownership interest in Hanna Strategies results of operations through January 2, 2008, when we acquired the remaining 72%. Provision for Income Taxes We account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse. On February 1, 2007 we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, (FIN 48) which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. Under FIN 48, companies are required to recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarified how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits, and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. The provisions of FIN 48 were effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. Based on our assessment, we recorded an increase to opening retained earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 for tax benefits not previously recognized of $26.4 million as a result of adopting FIN 48. Our effective tax rate was 27% and 24% during fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective tax rate increased 3% from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 primarily due to non deductible goodwill impairment and in process research and development expenses. Our effective tax rate was 24% and 21% during fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate increased 3% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in tax benefits, as a percentage of pre tax earnings, from the lapse of statute of limitations or audit closures and the phase out of extraterritorial income exclusion. Our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the Federal statutory rate, research credits, state income taxes, SFAS 123R, FIN 48, FAS 141R, U.S. Manufacturers deduction, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax law. At January 31, 2009, we had net deferred tax assets of $133.7 million. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets. For additional information regarding our income tax provision, see Note 3, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs. In addition to operating expenses, we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives, which include acquisitions of products, technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program. See further discussion of these items below. At January 31, 2009, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaling $981.1 million, net accounts receivable of $316.5 million and $52.1 million of outstanding under our lines of credit. We have a U.S. line of credit facility that permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to $250.0 million and a China line of credit that permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to $5.0 million. These line of credit agreements contain customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on our assets, and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if we fail to maintain their financial covenants. The lines of credit are available for working capital or other business needs. We drew on the U.S. line of credit during fiscal 2009 due to temporary differences between cash needs and cash availability in the U.S. During fiscal 2009 we principally used the facility to fund the 8.0 million share stock repurchase and for the acquisition of Moldflow. At January 31, 2009, we had $50.0 million outstanding on the U.S. line of credit. At January 31, 2009, we had $2.1 million outstanding on the China line of credit. We drew on the China line of credit due to temporary differences between cash needs and cash availability in China. The U.S. facility expires in August 2012 and the current China facility draw matures in May 2009. The China facility is a short term revolving facility which may be canceled or called at any time with 30 days written notice. As of March 18, 2009, the balances outstanding on the U.S. and China line of credit facilities were $10.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Our primary commercial banking relationship is with Citibank and its global affiliates (Citibank). Our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally, and the portion of our cash and cash equivalents held by Citibank has been significantly reduced during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Citicorp USA, Inc., an affiliate of Citibank, is the lead lender and agent in the syndicate of our $250.0 million U.S. line of credit. Recently, Citibank, like many financial institutions, has obtained government assistance. At January 31, 2009, our short term investment portfolio consisted of term deposits, money market funds and mutual funds with an estimated fair value of $63.5 million, and a cost basis of $68.0 million. Of this cost basis amount, $19.9 million was invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our Deferred Compensation Plan (see Note 4, Deferred Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion), and $10.3 million was invested in bank term deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days and less than one year. The remaining $37.8 million was invested in two money market funds: $35.1 million was invested in The Reserve International Liquidity Fund (the International Fund) and $2.7 million was invested in The Reserve Primary Fund (the Primary Fund, and together with the International Fund, the Reserve Funds). In mid September, the Reserve Funds ceased redemptions after net asset values of the funds decreased below $1 per share. This occurred as a result of the Reserve Funds revaluing their holdings of debt securities issued by Lehman Brothers, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the Reserve Funds. Accordingly, we recorded $4.5 million other than temporary impairment impacting fiscal 2009. The impairment expense was recorded in Interest and other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The timing of redemptions from the Reserve Funds currently is undetermined. The SEC is overseeing the administration, accounting and payout of the U.S. based Primary Fund, and a third party court appointed supervisor is overseeing, but not managing, the accounting and payment administration of the non U.S. based International Fund. At this time, these investments are not currently liquid, and in the event we need to access these funds, we will not be able to do so. However, it is our current belief that the distributions for the Reserve Funds will occur within the next 12 months. Accordingly, the Reserve Funds are classified in current Marketable Securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2009. This re designation is included in Purchases of 45 Table of Contents available for sale marketable securities in the investing activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, the Reserve Funds made a partial distribution under which we received $75.0 million, leaving an additional $37.8 million, on a cost basis, still outstanding. At January 31, 2009, our investment portfolio included two auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of $7.6 million and a cost basis of $9.0 million. Our auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments that have underlying securities with contractual maturities greater than ten years and interest rates that were structured to reset at auction every 28 days. The securities, which met our investment guidelines at the time the investments were made, have failed to settle in auctions since August 2007. In addition, these auction rate securities, which were previously AAA rated, were downgraded during fiscal 2009. Under the contractual terms of these investments, because the auctions failed to settle, the interest rate on these investments reset by increasing to the Libor rate plus 200 basis points, which represents a premium interest rate on these investments. At this time, these investments are not currently liquid, and in the event we need to access these funds, we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal unless a future auction is successful, or a secondary market is available. In fiscal 2009 we recorded an other than temporary impairment of $1.4 million related to these investments. The impairment expense was recorded in Interest and other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Due to the lack of liquidity of these investments, they are included in Marketable securities non current. We will continue to evaluate our accounting for our investments on a quarterly basis. See Note 12, Financial Instruments, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financial instruments. Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $593.9 million for fiscal 2009 was primarily comprised of net income and the net effect of non cash expenses associated with the impairment of goodwill and intangibles, primarily related to our M&E segment, as well as restructuring charges. The primary working capital sources of cash were decreases in accounts receivable and increases in deferred revenue. The decrease in accounts receivable relates primarily to reduced billings at the end of fiscal 2009 due to a decline in revenue. Our days sales outstanding in trade receivables reflect the seasonality in maintenance billings, and was 59 days at January 31, 2009 and 2008. The primary working capital use of cash was decreased accrued expenses primarily due to lower accrued employee bonuses and commissions. We expect net cash flows provided by operating activities to be negative in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of lower revenue combined with cash expenditures in the quarter for payments of the annual employee incentive plan and payments related to our restructuring plan. Other than the draws on the lines of credit discussed above, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations or commercial commitments. Long term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following: the acquisition of new businesses, software products, or technologies complementary to our business; capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal use software applications; stock repurchases; and funding restructuring costs. In addition, $19.9 million of our marketable securities are held in a rabbi trust under non qualified deferred compensation plans as of January 31, 2009. See Note 4, Deferred Compensation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. To minimize the effect of these fluctuations, we use foreign currency option contracts and forwards to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments, primarily certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. Prior to the quarter ended October 31, 2008, our foreign currency instruments, by practice, had maturities of less than three months and settled before the end of each quarterly period. During fiscal 2009, we entered into foreign currency instruments with maturities longer than three months that did not settle before the end of each quarterly period. We have expanded our hedge program beyond the current quarter to reduce foreign currency risk and volatility by entering into cash flow hedges for one to 12 months in the future with reduced protection for our longer term hedge instruments. The principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2009 were the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar. We monitor our foreign exchange exposures to review the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. 46 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at January 31, 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at January 31, 2009. Total Fiscal Year2010 Fiscal Years2011 2012 Fiscal Years2013 2014 Thereafter (in millions) Operating lease obligations $ 227.9 $ 62.2 $ 83.2 $ 39.1 $ 43.4 Purchase obligations 44.3 39.9 4.3 0.1 Total(1)(2) $ 272.2 $ 102.1 $ 87.5 $ 39.2 $ 43.4 (1) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet or certain purchase obligations as discussed below. (2) The table also excludes (a) amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FIN 48, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities (see Note 3 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and (b) non qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash disbursements to plan participants (see Note 4 Deferred Compensation to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Autodesk and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies, services and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies, services or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, in most instances, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. In addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, included in cost of license and other revenue, was $17.1 million in fiscal 2009, $14.9 million in fiscal 2008, and $16.8 million in fiscal 2007. Principal commitments at January 31, 2009 shown above consist of obligations under operating leases for facilities and computer equipment, IT infrastructure costs, marketing costs and contractual software development services. Purchase commitments also include $21.7 million related to a termination fee for an outsource application hosting services agreement entered into during fiscal 2006. This fee is reduced as time elapses during the five year contract period. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. We provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. Historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations. 47 Table of Contents Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 164.0 million shares. The purpose of the stock repurchase program is to help offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders. The number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors, including general market conditions, the volume of employee stock option exercises, the trading price of our common stock, cash on hand and available in the U.S., and company defined trading windows. There were no repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended January 31, 2009; during the year ended January 31, 2009 we repurchased 8.0 million shares of our common stock. At January 31, 2009, 16.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization. This program does not have a fixed expiration date. See Note 7, Shareholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities. As of January 31, 2009 we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Stock Compensation As of January 31, 2009, we maintained two active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and non employee members of our Board of Directors: the 2008 Employee Stock Plan (2008 Plan), which is available only to employees, and the 2000 Directors Option Plan, as amended (2000 Plan), which is available only to non employee directors. Additionally, there are six expired or terminated plans with options outstanding, including the 2006 Employee Stock Plan (2006 Plan), which was replaced by the 2008 Employee Stock Plan in March 2008. The 2008 Plan was approved by our stockholders in November 2007. Under this plan, 16.5 million shares of our common stock, and 0.48 million shares that remained available for issuance under the 2006 Plan upon its expiration, were reserved for issuance. The 2008 Plan permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units; however, no more than 2.5 million of the shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 Plan may be issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock units. At January 31, 2009, 13.4 million shares were available for future issuance under the 2008 Plan. The 2008 Plan will expire in March 2011. The 2000 Plan, which was originally approved by the stockholders in June 2000, allows for an automatic annual grant of options to non employee members of Autodesks Board of Directors. At January 31, 2009, 0.8 million shares were available for future issuance. The 2000 Plan will expire in March 2010. Our stock option program is broad based and designed to promote long term retention. Essentially all of our employees participate. Approximately 90% of the options we granted during fiscal 2009 were awarded to employees other than our CEO, CFO and the three other most highly compensated officers for fiscal 2009, which we refer to as our Named Executive Officers. Options granted under the 2008 Plan and the 2000 Plan vest over periods ranging from one to four years and expire within four to seven years of the date of grant. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, the exercise price of all stock options granted under these plans was equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date. All stock option grants to executive officers are made by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. All members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee are independent directors, as defined by the listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Grants to our non employee directors are non discretionary and are pre determined by the terms of the 2000 Plan. 48 Table of Contents For further information concerning Autodesks policies and procedures regarding the use of stock options, see Compensation Discussion and Analysis incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled Executive Compensation, in our Proxy Statement for our fiscal year 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission not later than 120 days after the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. In addition to our stock option plans, our employees are also eligible to participate in Autodesks 1998 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (ESP Plan). Eligible employees may purchase shares of Autodesks common stock at their discretion using up to 15% of their compensation subject to certain limitations, at not less than 85% of fair market value as defined in the plan agreement. At January 31, 2009, 24.8 million shares were available for future issuance. This amount will automatically be increased on the first trading day of each fiscal year by an amount equal to the lesser of 10.0 million shares or 2.0% of the total outstanding shares plus any shares repurchased by Autodesk during the prior fiscal year. We typically issue shares on March 31 and September 30 of each fiscal year. The provisions of this plan expire during fiscal 2018. On August 17, 2006, we disclosed that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors was conducting a voluntary review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues. Due to this review, Autodesk was not current with its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 until June 2007, and suspended contributions and purchases under the ESP Plan during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the first quarter of fiscal 2008. On September 18, 2006, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to our ESP Plan which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period, unless they elected not to participate. The Board of Directors also approved a one time cash bonus of $8.8 million to non executive employees enrolled in the ESP Plan at that date. This bonus approximated the profits employee participants would have made on the scheduled September 30, 2006 exercise date, had the purchases been made and the shares been sold on the next trading day at close of market, and was expensed as additional compensation expense at the time it was paid. On March 22, 2007, our Board of Directors approved an amendment, which superseded the September 18, 2006 amendment, which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period ending in September 2007, unless they elected not to participate. In June 2007, we became current with our financial filings and resumed employee contributions to the ESP Plan. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our revenue, earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. Prior to the quarter ended October 31, 2008 such contracts did not extend beyond the current quarter; however, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we entered into longer term hedging contracts. We have expanded our foreign currency cash flow hedge program beyond one quarter, and as of January 31, 2009 have open contracts to hedge expected cash flows for one to 12 months in the future in order to reduce foreign currency volatility. Contracts are primarily denominated in euros, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, British pounds and Canadian dollars. We do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The notional amount of our option and forward contracts was $276.7 million and $131.8 million at January 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We utilize foreign currency option collar and forward contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions. A sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of January 31, 2009 indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2009 would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $25.7 million. A hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at January 31, 2009 would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $19.7 million. The results of the sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of January 31, 2008 indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2008 would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and 49 Table of Contents option contracts by $3.9 million and a hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at January 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $2.8 million. We do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts. Interest rate sensitivity At January 31, 2009, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of $63.5 million. At January 31, 2008, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of $31.4 million. The short term mutual fund balances included $19.9 million at January 31, 2009 and $26.7 million at January 31, 2008 of amounts held in a rabbi trust under deferred compensation arrangements. See Note 4, Deferred Compensation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and short term investments. Assuming an average investment balance of $694.2 million in 2009, if interest rates were to increase (decrease) by 10%, this would result in a $0.3 million increase (decrease) in annual interest income. Further, at January 31, 2009 we held $71.1 million in Money Market Funds, Mutual Funds, Bank Term Deposits and Auction Rate Securities which by their structure are not directly susceptible to valuation changes due to increases or decreases in interest rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk. We place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy guidelines, which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument. 50 Table of Contents
