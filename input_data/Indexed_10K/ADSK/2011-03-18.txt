ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion in our MD&A contains trend analyses and other forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements are any statements that look to future events and consist of, among other things, our business strategies, including those discussed below in Strategy, anticipated future net revenue, future operating margin and other future financial results (by product and geography) and operating expenses, availability of credit for our customers and partners, our backlog, our belief that the strength of our channel network, technological leadership, brand recognition, breadth of product line, and large installed base are benefitting us as global economies recover, expected trends in certain financial metrics, the impact of acquisitions and investment activities, the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates and our hedging activities on our financial results, the impact of economic volatility and geopolitical activities in certain countries, particularly emerging economy countries, and the resulting effect on our financial results, and our ability to successfully expand adoption of our products, our ability to successfully increase sales of product suites as part of our overall sales strategy and the impact of our restructuring activities. In addition, forward looking statements also consist of statements involving expectations regarding product acceptance, continuation of our stock repurchase program, statements regarding our liquidity and short term and long term cash requirements, as well as, statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as may, believe, could, anticipate, would, might, plan, expect, and similar expressions or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and are subject to business and economic risks. As such, our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth above in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made. Strategy Autodesks vision is to help people imagine, design and create a better world. We do this by developing software for the worlds designers, architects, engineers, and digital artists the people who create the products, buildings, infrastructure, films, and games. Autodesk serves customers in three primary markets: architecture, engineering and construction; manufacturing; and digital media and entertainment. Our goal is to provide our customers with the worlds most valuable, innovative, and engaging software and services. Our product and services portfolio allow our customers to digitally visualize, simulate, and analyze their projects, helping them to better understand the consequences of their design decisions; save time, money, and resources; and become more innovative. Today complex challenges such as globalization, urbanization, and sustainable design are driving our customers to new levels of performance and competitiveness, and we are committed to helping them address those challenges and take advantage of new opportunities. To achieve these goals, we are capitalizing on two of our strongest competitive advantages: our ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets, and the breadth and depth of our product portfolio. By innovating in existing technology categories, we bring powerful new design capabilities to volume markets. Our products are designed to be easy to learn and use, and to provide customers with a low cost of deployment, a low total cost of ownership, and a rapid return on investment. In addition, our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products. The breadth of our technology and product line gives us a unique competitive advantage, because it allows our customers to address a wide variety of problems in ways that transcend industry and disciplinary boundaries. This is particularly important in helping our customers address the complex challenges mentioned above. We also believe that our technological leadership and global brand recognition have positioned us well for long term growth and industry leadership. 30 Table of Contents In addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology, our large global network of distributors, resellers, third party developers, customers, educational institutions, faculty and students is a key competitive advantage. This network of relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world. Our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase, deploy, learn, and support our products quickly and easily. We have a significant number of registered third party developers who create products that work well with Autodesk products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications. Users fluent in our products are broadly and globally available from educational institutions and in the existing workforce. We offer extensive educational programs, including student versions of software, curricula, and faculty development. We have an extensive global community of students who are fluent in our software and poised to become the next generation of professional users thus reducing the cost of training and providing fresh talent for our customers. Our global network of distributors, resellers, third party developers, customers, educational institutions and students has been developed over our twenty eight year history. We believe it is an enduring competitive advantage that is difficult for others to replicate. Our growth strategy includes continually increasing the business value of our design tools to our customers in a number of ways. First, we seek to address an increasing portion of our customers workflow with products that extend the value of our customers digital design information into visualization, analysis, and simulation. Second, we extend our customers workflow with products for adjacent users and for the customers of our customers, thus increasing the value of the design information our customers produce. Third, we seek to improve our product interoperability and usability, thus improving our customers productivity and effectiveness. Fourth, we develop new ways to deliver capability and value to our customers, such as product suites, software as a service, mobile devices, and new hardware platforms. Notably, in October 2010, we released AutoCAD for the Mac, reaching a large base of native Mac environment customers. Finally, we have developed a new line of consumer products for the Web, iPad, and mobile devices that provide our advanced visualization technologies to consumers a whole new category of Autodesk customer. A number of our customers use our horizontal design products, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. We also develop a large number of vertical model based design products. We believe that expanding our horizontal design product customers portfolios to include our vertical design products and our model based design products, and now our suites, presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy. For fiscal 2011, revenue from model based design products increased 18% as compared to the prior fiscal year and as a percentage of revenue, increased to 30% in fiscal 2011 as compared to 29% in fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2011, revenue from Suites increased 26%, as compared to the prior fiscal year, and as a percentage of revenue increased to 23% in fiscal 2011 as compared to 20% in fiscal 2010. We believe that the adoption of vertical design products and model based design products by our customers in all industries will increase their productivity and the value of their design data. Expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy. While emerging markets are important for all global businesses, we believe they hold special opportunity for Autodesk. Much of the growth in the worlds construction and manufacturing is happening in emerging markets. Further, emerging markets face many of the challenges that our design technology can help address, for example infrastructure build out. We believe that emerging economies continue to present long term growth opportunities for us and revenue from emerging countries increased 17% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Revenue from emerging countries represented 15% of both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 net revenue. While we believe there are long term growth opportunities in emerging economies, conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges, including economic volatility, geopolitical risk, local competition, intellectual property protection, poorly developed business infrastructure, scarcity of talent and software piracy. Our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology and businesses. Acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers; however, they entail cost 31 Table of Contents and integration challenges and may, in certain instances, negatively impact our operating margins. We continually review these trade offs in making decisions regarding acquisitions. We currently anticipate that we will acquire products, technology and businesses as compelling opportunities that promote our strategy become available. The pace at which we make such investments will vary depending upon our business needs, the availability of suitable sellers and technology, and our own financial condition. Our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions, including that we will be able to continue making our technology available to mainstream markets; leverage our large global network of distributors, resellers, third party developers, customers, educational institutions, and students; improve the performance and functionality of our products; and adequately protect our intellectual property. If the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations, we may not be able to implement our strategy, which could potentially adversely affect our business. For further discussion regarding these and related risks see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We regularly reevaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that of all our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For multiple element arrangements that include software products, we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method, under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value. VSOE is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority. If we do not have VSOE of an undelivered software license, we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have VSOE are delivered. If we do not have VSOE for undelivered maintenance or services, the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual period in the arrangement. We are required to exercise judgment in determining whether VSOE exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent. Our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition. If we do not believe that collection is probable, the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received. Our indirect channel model includes both a two tiered distribution structure, where distributors sell to resellers, and a one tiered structure where Autodesk sells directly to resellers. Our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor, in a two tiered structure, or reseller, in a one tiered structure, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. This policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns, among other criteria. We are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or 32 Table of Contents determinable payments, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. Our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Marketable Securities. At January 31, 2011 we had $391.8 million of short and long term marketable securities. Marketable securities are stated at fair value. As described in Note 3, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we estimate the fair value of our marketable securities each quarter. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When identical or similar assets are traded in active markets, the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low. This is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities, which we consider to be Level 1 assets and Level 2 assets. However, determining the fair value of marketable securities when observable inputs are not available (Level 3) requires significant judgment. For example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our auction rate securities; because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive. This determination is based on the fact that due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, the regularly scheduled auctions for the auction rate securities we hold have generally failed since August 2007. These assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment. Whenever possible, we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available, when determining fair value. Business Combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to assets and liabilities, as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from sales, maintenance agreements and acquired developed technologies; the acquired companys trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio; expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; and discount rates. Goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. When assessing goodwill for impairment, we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired, or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges. As of January 31, 2011, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill, nor result in impairment of goodwill. For further discussion see Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Realizability of Long Lived Assets. We assess the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or sooner should events or 33 Table of Contents changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. We consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget; shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and the results of past impairment reviews. In assessing the recoverability of these long lived assets, we first determine their fair values, which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets. If impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models, which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows, we would discount the cash flows to assess impairments on long lived assets. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values. In addition to our recoverability assessments, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters. We will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges. Income Taxes. We currently have $147.5 million of net deferred tax assets, primarily a result of tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, purchased technologies and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by the establishment of U.S. deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, deferred tax liabilities associated with tax method change on advanced payments and valuation allowances against California and Canadian deferred tax assets. We perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors. Any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made. Stock Based Compensation. We measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award, and recognize expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. The determination of the fair value of a stock based award on the date of grant using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends. The variables used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted, as needed. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Legal Contingencies. As described in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Part II, Item 8, Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings. We routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. Because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations. 34 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Part II, Item 8, Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference. Overview of Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31, 2011 As a % of NetRevenue Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31, 2010 As a % of NetRevenue (in millions) Net Revenue $ 1,951.8 100 % $ 1,713.7 100 % Cost of revenue 196.6 10 % 191.8 11 % Gross Profit 1,755.2 90 % 1,521.9 89 % Operating expenses 1,483.8 76 % 1,456.3 85 % Income from Operations $ 271.4 14 % $ 65.6 4 % Our results for fiscal 2011 reflect recent improvements in global demand, as compared to the prior fiscal year when the economic downturn had decreased demand for our products and services, and customers reduced their workforces. While some global macroeconomic indicators improved during fiscal 2011, unemployment remains high in several important geographies, including the U.S. Additionally, there are a number of mixed data points as to whether credit has become more readily available, and it is unclear whether and how the availability of credit continues to impact our customers and partners. Our business grew year over year as evidenced by our increases in revenue, gross profit and income from operations. During fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, net revenue increase 14%, gross profit increased 15% and income from operations increased 314%. Contributing to the year over year increases in revenue were increases in revenue from new seat licenses, maintenance revenue, revenue for most of our major products, all of our reportable segments, and all of our geographies during fiscal 2011 as compared to the prior fiscal year. In addition, we continued to make progress in controlling our operating costs, which led to year over year improvements in profitability. The 314% increase in income from operations in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was due to the increase in our net revenue, while holding the growth of operating expenses. The majority of our costs are relatively fixed in the short term as they relate primarily to our workforce. In fiscal 2011 we were able to grow our net revenue without significantly increasing our workforce. We believe that the improvements in these areas are indications that our business stabilized and is beginning to grow. Our total operating margin increased from $65.6 million, or 4% of revenue during fiscal 2010 to $271.4 million, or 14% of revenue during fiscal 2011. The increase in our operating margin during fiscal 2011 was primarily due to net revenue increasing more rapidly than the increase in our costs due to our cost saving initiatives during fiscal 2011 and 2010. Net revenue increased 238.1 million or 14% for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, while our operating expenses increased $27.5 million, or 2% for fiscal 2011. The 2% increase in operating expenses in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010 was due to performance based compensation related to higher company performance, the return of employee costs which were temporarily suppressed in the prior year such as, salary reductions, employee incentives and mandatory vacation, and other costs associated with higher revenue. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring charges of $37.4 million, the decrease in goodwill impairment charges of $21.0 million and the decrease in stock based compensation charges of $12.7 million. We believe net revenue for fiscal 2012 will increase by approximately 10% compared to fiscal 2011. We anticipate fiscal 2012 operating margin will increase by approximately 220 basis points compared to fiscal 2011. Net revenue from Japan was $200.6 million, or approximately 10% of our net revenue, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011. The earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011 has created uncertainty, which may impact our future financial results. 35 Table of Contents We generate a significant amount of our revenue in the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, South Korea, Australia and Belgium. Included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency. Our revenue benefited from foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. Had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2010 been in effect during fiscal 2011 and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from fiscal 2011, (on a constant currency basis), net revenue would have increased 13% compared to the prior fiscal year. Operating expenses during fiscal year 2011 increased 2% compared to the prior fiscal year as reported and increased 3% on a constant currency basis. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue, operating expenses and income from operations in future periods. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions, but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuation of such foreign currency against the U.S. dollar. We rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the U.S. and international regions, including Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates (collectively, Tech Data). Tech Data accounted for 16% and 14% of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2011 and 2010, respectively. We believe our business is not substantially dependent on Tech Data. Our actual customers through Tech Data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services. Should any of the agreements between us and Tech Data be terminated for any reason, we believe that arrangements could be made so that the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through Tech Data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to us. Our primary goals for fiscal 2012 are to grow revenue and improve operating margin percentage by delivering our market leading products and solutions to our customers and investing in product functionality and new product lines, including Suites offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will achieve our financial goals and improve our financial results. At January 31, 2011, we had $1,466.9 million in cash and marketable securities. We completed fiscal 2011 with a higher deferred revenue balance and a higher accounts receivable balance as compared to fiscal 2010. Our deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2011 included $509.5 million of customer maintenance contracts, which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts, which is predominantly one year, but may be two or three year, or occasionally as long as five year terms. We repurchased 9.0 million shares of our common stock for $280.3 million during fiscal 2011. Comparatively, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $63.2 million during fiscal 2010. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Revenue Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2011 Increase (decrease)compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2010 Increase (decrease)compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2009 $ % $ % (in millions) Net Revenue: License and other $ 1,172.1 $ 191.4 20 % $ 980.7 $ (622.7 ) 39 % $ 1,603.4 Maintenance 779.7 46.7 6 % 733.0 21.2 3 % 711.8 $ 1,951.8 $ 238.1 14 % $ 1,713.7 $ (601.5 ) 26 % $ 2,315.2 Net Revenue by Geographic Area: Americas $ 701.5 $ 47.1 7 % $ 654.4 $ (127.9 ) 16 % $ 782.3 Europe, Middle East and Africa 782.8 111.7 17 % 671.1 (332.3 ) 33 % 1,003.4 Asia Pacific 467.5 79.3 20 % 388.2 (141.3 ) 27 % 529.5 $ 1,951.8 $ 238.1 14 % $ 1,713.7 $ (601.5 ) 26 % $ 2,315.2 Net Revenue by Operating Segment: Platform Solutions and Emerging Business $ 716.2 $ 92.2 15 % $ 624.0 $ (276.8 ) 31 % $ 900.8 Architecture, Engineering and Construction 568.0 54.7 11 % 513.3 (128.1 ) 20 % 641.4 Manufacturing 470.0 83.1 22 % 386.9 (101.5 ) 21 % 488.4 Media and Entertainment 197.6 8.5 4 % 189.1 (73.0 ) 28 % 262.1 Other (0.4 ) 100 % 0.4 (22.1 ) 98 % 22.5 $ 1,951.8 $ 238.1 14 % $ 1,713.7 $ (601.5 ) 26 % $ 2,315.2 Fiscal 2011 Net Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net Revenue License and Other Revenue License and other revenue is comprised of two components: all forms of product license revenue and other revenue. Product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seat licenses, upgrades and crossgrades. Other revenue consists of revenue from Creative Finishing, consulting and training services, collaborative project management services, and our former Location Services division. We divested the Location Services division in February 2009. Total license and other revenue increased 20% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. License and other revenue from horizontal design and vertical design products increased 18% and license and other revenue from model based design products increased 18%, each as compared to the prior fiscal year. These increases were primarily due to the 31% increase in commercial new seat revenue during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, 28 percentage points of the 31% increase was due to the increase in the number of seats sold, and 3 percentage points was due to higher average net revenue per seat. Commercial new seat revenue, as a percentage of license and other revenue, was 67% and 61% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Also contributing to the increase in license and other revenue during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was the 22% increase in upgrade revenue, which includes crossgrade revenue. Upgrade revenue was higher during fiscal 2011 primarily due to a one time increase in upgrades in response to a promotion in advance of the March 2010 increase in upgrade pricing, an additional promotion run in the Americas geography in the fourth quarter and an increase in the number of larger revenue transactions in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. 37 Table of Contents Revenue from the sales of our services, training and support, included in License and other revenue, represented less than 4% of net revenue for all periods presented. Maintenance Revenue Our maintenance revenue relates to a program known by our user community as the Subscription Program. Our maintenance program provides our commercial and educational customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts. Under our maintenance program, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available, downloadable training courses and online support. We recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods. Maintenance revenue increased 6% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 7% increase in commercial maintenance revenue. Total subscription program enrollment at January 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of about 2.9 million users and 2.2 million users, respectively. The 7% increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to a 5 percentage point increase in net revenue per maintenance seat and a 2 percentage point increase in commercial enrollment during the corresponding maintenance contract term. Commercial maintenance revenue represented 98% of maintenance revenue for both fiscal 2011 and 2010. Changes in maintenance revenue lag changes in net billings for maintenance contracts because we recognize the revenue from those contracts ratably over their contract terms, which are predominantly one year, but may be two or three year, or occasionally as long as five year terms. Net maintenance billings increased 14% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was due to an increase in renewals, more new seats sold and the impact from the upgrade pricing promotion mentioned above. Aggregate backlog at January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010 was $615.4 million and $542.5 million, respectively, of which $587.9 million and $516.5 million, respectively, represented deferred revenue. Backlog related to current software license product orders that had not shipped at the end of the quarter increased by $1.5 million during fiscal 2011 from $26.0 million at January 31, 2010 to $27.5 million at January 31, 2011. Deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue. To a lesser extent, deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from collaborative project management services, consulting services and deferred license sales. Backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period. Net Revenue by Geographic Area Net revenue in the Americas geography increased by 7% both as reported and on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to a 33% increase in revenue from new seats in the Americas during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Maintenance revenue increased 3% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The Americas was affected by slower economic growth than our other geographies, which impacted growth rates for all of our products during fiscal 2011. Net revenue in the EMEA geography increased by 17%, or 18% on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to a 24% increase in new seat revenue and a 9% increase in maintenance revenue. The EMEA geographys increase in revenue during fiscal 2011 was primarily due to economic expansion in virtually all countries in that geography. The increase in our revenue in that geography was led by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Belgium. Net revenue in the APAC geography increased by 20%, or 17% on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 24% increase in new seat revenue and a 48% increase in 38 Table of Contents upgrade revenue. Net revenue expansion in the APAC geography during fiscal 2011 occurred in virtually all countries, led by Japan and followed by South Korea, Australia and India. Net revenue in emerging economies increased 17% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to revenue from China, the Russian Federation, India, Brazil and Poland. This growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2011. Revenue from emerging economies represented 15% of net revenue for both fiscal 2011 and 2010. We believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue. The economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected, and could continue to significantly affect, our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue. International net revenue represented 71% of our net revenue in fiscal 2011 and 69% of our net revenue in fiscal 2010. We remain cautious regarding our financial prospects primarily due the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of the global economic recovery. Net Revenue by Operating Segment We have four reportable segments: Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB), Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC), Manufacturing (MFG) and Media and Entertainment (M&E). Location Services, which we disposed of in February 2009, is not included in any of the above reportable segments and is reflected as Other. We have no material inter segment revenue. Net revenue for PSEB increased 15% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 20% increase in revenue from both our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT products, offset by a net 21% decrease in revenue from all other PSEB products and services. Net revenue for AEC increased 11% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 24% increase in revenue from our Revit products, a 6% increase in revenue from our AutoCAD Civil 3D products, and a 27% increase in revenue from our Navisworks products. Net revenue for MFG increased 22% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 23% increase in revenue from our Autodesk Inventor products and a 28% increase in our AutoCAD Mechanical products. Net revenue for M&E increased 5% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 5% increase in revenue from our Animation product group and a 3% increase in revenue from Creative Finishing. The increase in Animation revenue was primarily due to a 4% increase in revenue from Autodesk 3ds Max. Fiscal 2010 Net Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net Revenue License and Other Revenue Total license and other revenue decreased 39% during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. License and other revenue from horizontal design and vertical design products decreased 33% and license and other revenue from model based design products decreased 19%, each as compared to the prior fiscal year. These decreases were primarily due to the 44% decrease in commercial new seat revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2010, 29 percentage points of the 44% decrease was due to decreases in the number of seats sold, and 15 percentage points was due to lower average net revenue per seat. Commercial new seat revenue, as a percentage of license and other revenue, was 61% and 67% for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Also contributing to the decrease in license and other revenue during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, was the 32% decrease in upgrade revenue, which includes crossgrade revenue. The decrease in upgrade revenue 39 Table of Contents was driven primarily by the global economic contraction. Additionally, upgrade revenue was lower during fiscal 2010 because of the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products, as compared to the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD based products during fiscal 2009, due to a higher percentage of customers on our maintenance program, which includes unspecified upgrades when and if available. Maintenance Revenue Maintenance revenue increased 3% during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a 3% increase in commercial maintenance revenue. The increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to 8 percentage points from higher net revenue per maintenance seat, partially offset by 5 percentage points from lower program enrollment due to the economic downturn. Our 3% increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, reflects an 18% increase in maintenance billings in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, partially offset by a 7% decline in maintenance billings in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The number of users increased from 1.7 million at January 31, 2009 to 2.2 million at January 31, 2010 primarily due to a one time adjustment of 0.6 million educational seats for users who were migrated to a standard educational maintenance plan during the second fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2009. These users were not previously captured in our maintenance installed base prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Maintenance billings declined 7% in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. This decrease was due to fewer new seats sold and a decrease in renewal rates as customers reduced their work force. The year over year growth in billings for maintenance contracts began to slow in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, although maintenance billings increased slightly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The year over year decrease in maintenance billings caused downward pressure on maintenance revenue during subsequent years. Net Revenue by Geographic Area Net revenue in the Americas geography decreased by 16% both as reported and on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a 27% decrease in revenue from new seats, partially offset by a 5% increase in upgrade revenue in the Americas during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Maintenance revenue growth was flat in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Growth in the Americas was affected by economic volatility that impacted growth rates for all of our products during fiscal 2010. Net revenue in the EMEA geography decreased by 33%, or 26% on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a 50% decrease in new seat revenue and a 49% decrease in revenue from upgrades. These decreases were partially offset by a 2% increase in maintenance revenue in EMEA during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The EMEA geographys decline in revenue during fiscal 2010 was primarily due to economic contraction in virtually all countries in that geography. The decrease in our revenue in that geography was led by emerging economy countries followed by Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The negative effect of the stronger value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, the British pound and other European currencies also contributed to the decrease in net revenue in EMEA. Net revenue in the APAC geography decreased by 27%, or 28% on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a 38% decrease in new seat revenue and a 42% decrease in upgrade revenue. These decreases were partially offset by a 13% increase in maintenance revenue. Net revenue contraction in the APAC geography during fiscal 2010 occurred in virtually all countries, led by Japan and followed by China, South Korea, India and Australia. Revenue from emerging economies decreased 37% during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Revenue from emerging economies represented 15% and 18% of net revenue during fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. This decrease contributed to our international sales contraction during fiscal 2010. 40 Table of Contents International net revenue represented 69% of our net revenue in fiscal 2010 and 72% of our net revenue in fiscal 2009. We started to experience some economic difficulty in international sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Global conditions worsened, and the economic downturn significantly impacted our international sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, particularly the robust business we had been seeing in emerging economies. The economic contractions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue had an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance in fiscal 2010. Net Revenue by Operating Segment Net revenue for PSEB decreased 31% during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a 38% decrease in revenue from our AutoCAD LT products and a 31% decrease in revenue from our AutoCAD products, offset by a net 12% increase in revenue from all other PSEB products and services. Net revenue for AEC decreased 20% during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a 24% decrease in revenue from our Revit products, a 32% decrease in revenue from our AutoCAD Architecture products, a 15% decrease in revenue from our AutoCAD Civil 3D products and a net 13% decrease in revenue from all other AEC products and services. Net revenue for MFG decreased 21% during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a 25% decrease in revenue from our Autodesk Inventor products and a 34% decrease in revenue from our Autodesk Mechanical products, offset by a net 2% increase in revenue from all other MFG products and services. Net revenue for M&E decreased 28% during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a 42% decrease in revenue from Creative Finishing and an 18% decrease in revenue from our Animation product group. The decrease in Animation revenue was primarily due to a 33% decrease in revenue from Autodesk 3ds Max and a 17% decrease in revenue from Maya, offset by a net 32% increase in revenue from all other M&E products and services. Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenue Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2011 Increase (decrease)compared to priorfiscal year Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2010 Increase (decrease)compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal YearEndedJanuary 31,2009 $ % $ % (in millions) Cost of revenue: License and other $ 162.2 $ (9.8 ) 6 % $ 172.0 $ (31.7 ) 16 % $ 203.7 Maintenance 34.4 14.6 74 % 19.8 4.4 29 % 15.4 $ 196.6 $ 4.8 3 % $ 191.8 $ (27.3 ) 12 % $ 219.1 As a percentage of net revenue 10 % 11 % 9 % Cost of license and other revenue includes labor costs of order fulfillment and costs of fulfilling consulting and training services contracts and collaborative project management services contracts. Cost of license and other revenue also includes stock based compensation expense, direct material and overhead charges, amortization of purchased technology, professional services fees and royalties. Direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold (mainly PC based workstations for Creative Finishing in the M&E segment), costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media, printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs. During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Autodesk reclassified certain costs of revenue, which primarily included reclassifying certain shipping and fulfillment expenses from Cost of license and other revenue to 41 Table of Contents Cost of maintenance revenue, due to a change in our cost allocation methodology. These expenses have been updated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which include reclassifying $7.9 million and $6.5 million from cost of license to cost of maintenance revenue for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Cost of license and other revenue decreased 6% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to savings on shipping and handling costs caused by the switch to a lower cost vendor as well as an increase in electronic order fulfillment. Cost of license and other revenue decreased 16% during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the 39% decrease in license and other revenue. Cost of license and other revenue did not decline as rapidly as the associated net revenue in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 because of increased amortization of purchased technology related to fiscal years 2010 and 2009 acquisitions, costs associated with redundant services as we migrated a portion of our IT systems onto a new platform, and higher costs associated with the implementation of our electronic fulfillment system. Cost of maintenance revenue includes labor costs of providing product support to our maintenance customers, including stock based compensation expense for these employees, rent and occupancy, shipping and handling costs and professional services fees. Cost of maintenance revenue increased 74% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to an increase in maintenance support headcount. These increases were partially offset by savings on freight and materials costs as fewer maintenance customers require physical shipments than in the past due to electronic fulfillment. Cost of maintenance revenue increased 29% during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to an increase in product support headcount due to the acquisition of Moldflow Corporation in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Cost of revenue, at least over the near term, is affected by the volume and mix of product sales, mix of physical versus electronic fulfillment, fluctuations in consulting costs, amortization of purchased technology, new customer support offerings, royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products, and employee stock based compensation expense. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars, but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. Marketing and Sales Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2011 Increasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2010 Decreasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2009 $ % $ % (in millions) Marketing and sales $ 776.0 $ 44.1 6 % $ 731.9 $ (168.8 ) 19 % $ 900.7 As a percentage of net revenue 40 % 43 % 39 % Marketing and sales expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock based compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees, and the expense of travel, entertainment and training for such personnel, and the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows and expositions, and various sales and promotional programs. Marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs of sales and order processing, sales and dealer commissions, rent and occupancy, and the cost of supplies and equipment. Marketing and sales expenses increased 6% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to higher employee related costs related to variable compensation, including commissions, bonuses and related fringe benefits. Variable compensation expenses increased as a result of exceeding our fiscal 2011 target revenue growth and operating margin growth targets more than we did in fiscal 2010. Our annual incentive plans are based on forecasted revenue and operating margin, with current year targets set at the beginning of fiscal 2011. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in advertising and promotion spending and stock based compensation expense. Marketing and sales expenses decreased 19% during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower employee related costs, driven by decreased marketing and sales headcount and decreased travel expenditures and reduced advertising and promotional expenses. 42 Table of Contents We expect to balance our need to invest in the marketing and sales of our products with our desire to actively manage our sales and marketing operating expenses. As a result, we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in absolute dollars, but to slightly decrease as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. Research and Development Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2011 Increasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2010 Decreasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2009 $ % $ % (in millions) Research and development $ 496.2 $ 38.7 8 % $ 457.5 $ (118.6 ) 21 % $ 576.1 As a percentage of net revenue 25 % 27 % 25 % Research and development expenses, which are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock based compensation expense for research and development employees, and the expense of travel, entertainment and training for such personnel, rent and occupancy, professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors. Research and development expenses increased 8% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in bonuses, salaries and benefits. Research and development expenses decreased 21% during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to decreases in employee related costs driven by decreased research and development headcount. Also contributing to the decline was a decrease in acquisition related in process research and development charges from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, as we continue to invest in product development and acquire new technology in fiscal 2012. General and Administrative Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2011 Increasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2010 Decreasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2009 $ % $ % (in millions) General and administrative $ 200.8 $ 3.1 2 % $ 197.7 $ (8.0 ) 4 % $ 205.7 As a percentage of net revenue 10 % 12 % 9 % General and administrative expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock based compensation expense for our finance, human resources and legal employees, and the expense of travel, entertainment and training for such personnel as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services, amortization of acquisition related customer relationships and trade names, expense of communication and the cost of supplies and equipment. General and administrative expenses increased 2% from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 primarily due to an increase in bonuses and salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. General and administrative expenses decreased 4% from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 primarily due to decreases in employee related costs driven by decreased general and administrative headcount and reduced rent and occupancy costs due to the consolidation of facilities. This decrease was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization related to capital expenditures from fiscal 2009 and 2010. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars, but remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. 43 Table of Contents Restructuring Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2011 Decreasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2010 Increasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2009 $ % $ % (in millions) Restructuring $ 10.8 $ (37.4 ) 78 % $ 48.2 $ 8.0 20 % $ 40.2 As a percentage of net revenue 1 % 3 % 2 % In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to reduce operating costs. The restructuring plan resulted in targeted staff reductions of approximately 200 positions. No leased facilities were consolidated as part of this restructuring. In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we initiated a restructuring program, which resulted in headcount reduction of approximately 430 positions globally and resulted in the consolidation of approximately 32 leased facilities around the world in order to reduce our operating expenses. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs. This program reduced the number of employees by a total of approximately 700 positions globally and resulted in the consolidation of approximately 27 leased facilities. In connection with these restructuring programs, we recorded restructuring related charges of $10.8 million, $48.2 million and $40.2 million during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these amounts, $10.8 million, $24.3 million and $36.7 million were recorded for one time termination benefits and other costs during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $23.9 million and $3.5 million were recorded for facilities related costs during fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The one time termination benefits for these three restructuring programs have been substantially paid as of January 31, 2011. We expect to pay the facility related liabilities through fiscal 2018. See Note 16, Restructuring Reserve, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2011 Decreasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2010 Decreasecompared toprior fiscal year Fiscal yearEndedJanuary 31,2009 $ % $ % (in millions) Impairment of goodwill and intangibles $ $ (21.0 ) 100 % $ 21.0 $ (107.9 ) 84 % $ 128.9 As a percentage of net revenue 0 % 1 % 6 % We did not record an impairment charge during fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, we recorded an impairment charge of $21.0 million representing the entire goodwill balance of our M&E segment as of April 30, 2009. This goodwill balance related to our M&E segments fourth quarter fiscal 2009 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Softimage. During fiscal 2009 we recorded a $128.9 million impairment charge affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, primarily related to impairment of goodwill associated with our M&E segment. Should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future, additional impairment charges may be recorded to goodwill. As of January 31, 2011, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill, nor result in impairment of goodwill. See Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 44 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income, Net The following table sets forth the components of interest and other income, net: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Interest and investment income, net $ 10.9 $ 10.0 $ 13.6 Investment impairment (5.9 ) Gain (loss) on foreign currency (14.0 ) 5.0 (1.0 ) Other income 3.7 4.1 1.3 Interest and other income, net $ 0.6 $ 19.1 $ 8.0 Interest and other income, net, decreased $18.5 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to foreign currency losses. The loss on foreign currency in fiscal 2011 is primarily due to the impact of re measuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency of the corresponding entity, partially offset by the gain on foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Interest and investment income, net, fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances, average maturities and interest rates. The increase in Interest and investment income, net, during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the increase in interest income concurrent with the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance. The increase in interest and other income, net, during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, is primarily due to gains on marketable securities, gains on foreign currency transactions, a gain on the sale of an investment and the impairment of an investment during fiscal 2009. These increases were partially offset by lower interest rate yields on investments during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Provision for Income Taxes We account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse. Our effective tax rate was 22% and 32% during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our effective tax rate decreased 10 percentage points from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 primarily due to a change in expected future tax rates, the establishment of the California valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 and a decrease in non deductible stock based compensation expense, offset by a decrease in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the State of California enacted legislation significantly altering California tax law. As a result of the newly enacted legislation, we expect that in fiscal years 2012 and beyond, income subject to tax in California will be less than under prior tax law and accordingly, deferred tax assets are less likely to be realized. Our effective tax rate was 32% and 27% during fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our effective tax rate increased 5 percentage points from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a change in expected future tax rates and the establishment of the California valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 offset by non deductible goodwill impairment and in process research and development expenses in fiscal 2009. Our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate, research credits, state income taxes, the tax impact of stock based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, U.S. Manufacturers deduction, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax law. 45 Table of Contents At January 31, 2011, we had net deferred tax assets of $147.5 million. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets. For additional information regarding our income tax provision, see Note 5, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Financial Information In addition to our results determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) discussed above, we believe the following non GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, our gross profit, gross margin, income from operations, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP and non GAAP basis were as follows (in millions except for gross margin, operating margin and per share data): January 31,2011 January 31,2010 January 31,2009 (Unaudited) Gross profit $ 1,755.2 $ 1,521.9 $ 2,096.1 Non GAAP gross profit $ 1,790.0 $ 1,557.9 $ 2,122.9 Gross margin 90 % 89 % 91 % Non GAAP gross margin 92 % 91 % 92 % Income from operations $ 271.4 $ 65.6 $ 244.5 Non GAAP income from operations $ 418.8 $ 286.8 $ 576.7 Operating margin 14 % 4 % 11 % Non GAAP operating margin 21 % 17 % 25 % Net income $ 212.0 $ 58.0 $ 183.6 Non GAAP net income $ 310.4 $ 229.2 $ 439.5 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.90 $ 0.25 $ 0.80 Non GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 1.32 $ 0.99 $ 1.91 For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non GAAP measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis. These non GAAP measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. We use non GAAP measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential. In addition, these non GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to our and our competitors historical results and operating guidance. We also use these measures for purposes of determining company wide incentive compensation. There are limitations in using non GAAP financial measures because non GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non GAAP financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. The presentation of non GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 46 Table of Contents Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non GAAP Financial Measures (in millions except for gross margin, operating margin and per share data): Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Unaudited) Gross profit $ 1,755.2 $ 1,521.9 $ 2,096.1 Stock based compensation expense 2.9 3.1 3.6 Amortization of purchased intangibles(1) 31.9 32.9 23.2 Non GAAP gross profit $ 1,790.0 $ 1,557.9 $ 2,122.9 Gross margin 90 % 89 % 91 % Stock based compensation expense 0 % 0 % 0 % Amortization of purchased intangibles 2 % 2 % 1 % Non GAAP gross margin 92 % 91 % 92 % Income from operations $ 271.4 $ 65.6 $ 244.5 Stock based compensation expense 80.7 93.6 89.6 Amortization of purchased intangibles(1) 55.9 58.4 46.6 In process research and development 26.9 Impairment of goodwill 21.0 128.9 Restructuring charges 10.8 48.2 40.2 Non GAAP income from operations $ 418.8 $ 286.8 $ 576.7 Operating margin 14 % 4 % 11 % Stock based compensation expense 4 % 5 % 4 % Amortization of purchased intangibles(1) 3 % 4 % 2 % In process research and development 0 % 0 % 1 % Impairment of goodwill 0 % 3 % 5 % Restructuring charges 0 % 1 % 2 % Non GAAP operating margin 21 % 17 % 25 % Net income $ 212.0 $ 58.0 $ 183.6 Stock based compensation expense 80.7 93.6 89.6 Amortization of purchased intangibles(1) 55.9 58.4 46.6 In process research and development 26.9 Impairment of goodwill 21.0 128.9 Restructuring charges 10.8 48.2 40.2 Establishment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 21.0 Discrete tax provision items (6.0 ) (13.1 ) (10.0 ) Income tax effect of non GAAP adjustments (43.0 ) (57.9 ) (66.3 ) Non GAAP net income $ 310.4 $ 229.2 $ 439.5 Diluted net income per share $ 0.90 $ 0.25 $ 0.80 Stock based compensation expense 0.34 0.40 0.39 Amortization of purchased intangibles(1) 0.24 0.25 0.20 In process research and development 0.12 Impairment of goodwill 0.09 0.56 Restructuring charges 0.05 0.21 0.18 Establishment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 0.09 Discrete tax provision items (0.03 ) (0.04 ) (0.04 ) Income tax effect of non GAAP adjustments (0.18 ) (0.26 ) (0.30 ) Non GAAP diluted net income per share $ 1.32 $ 0.99 $ 1.91 (1) Amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of purchased developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names for acquisitions subsequent to December 2005. 47 Table of Contents Our non GAAP financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following: Stock based compensation expenses. We exclude stock based compensation expenses from non GAAP measures primarily because they are non cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Amortization of purchased intangibles and in process research and development expenses. We incur amortization of acquisition related purchased intangible assets and charges related to in process research and development primarily in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. The amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity, and management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Goodwill impairment. This is a non cash charge to write down goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired. As explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Restructuring charges. These expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions. In connection with these restructuring actions, we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated, and the closure of facilities and cancelation of certain contracts. We exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing financial results in the current period. Establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets. This is a non cash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. As explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Discrete tax items. We exclude the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the non GAAP measure of income, and include a non GAAP tax provision based upon the projected annual non GAAP effective tax rate. Management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations. Income tax effects on the difference between GAAP and non GAAP costs and expenses. The income tax effects that are excluded from the non GAAP measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between GAAP and non GAAP costs and expenses, primarily due to differences in the timing of when income tax benefits are recognized for stock compensation and purchased intangibles for GAAP and non GAAP measures. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs. In addition to operating expenses, we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives, which include acquisitions of products, technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program. See further discussion of these items below. At January 31, 2011, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1,466.9 million and net accounts receivable of $318.4 million. In addition, we have a U.S. line of credit facility that permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to $250.0 million. This line of credit agreement contains customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on our assets, and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if we fail to maintain the financial covenants. This 48 Table of Contents credit facility is available for working capital and other business needs. The U.S. line of credit expires in August 2012. In addition to the U.S line of credit, we had a $5.0 million China line of credit that was terminated during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2011, we had no borrowings or repayments on either of our line of credit facilities. At the beginning of fiscal 2010 we had $52.1 million outstanding on our U.S. and China line of credit facilities. During fiscal 2010, we borrowed $2.2 million under our credit facilities for a total outstanding balance of $54.3 million, all of which we repaid in fiscal 2010. As of January 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding under the U.S. and China line of credit facilities. Our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally. Our primary commercial banking relationship is with Citibank and its global affiliates (Citibank). In addition, Citicorp USA, Inc., an affiliate of Citibank, is the lead lender and agent in the syndicate of our $250.0 million U.S. line of credit. The increase in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities from $1,126.2 million at January 31, 2010 to $1,466.9 million at January 31, 2011 is principally the result of cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock following stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases. These increases to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock, capital expenditures, and cash used for business combinations and other investing activities. Cash generated from operations was positively impacted by higher net revenue. The primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of $540.8 million for fiscal 2011 was net income of $212.0 million increased by the effect of non cash expenses totaling $186.1 million associated with depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation. In addition, net cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was $131.9 million. The primary source of working capital was an increase in deferred revenue due to higher maintenance billings for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in accounts receivable due to higher billings in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and an increase in prepaid and other assets. At January 31, 2011, our short term investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of $199.2 million and a cost basis of $197.5 million. The portfolio fair value consisted of $47.7 million invested in commercial paper and corporate securities, $47.2 million invested in U.S. government agency securities, $31.3 million invested in mutual funds, $29.0 million invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase greater than 90 days and less than one year, $26.0 million invested in U.S treasury securities, $9.1 million invested in sovereign debt, $8.6 million invested in municipal securities and $0.3 million invested in other short term securities. At January 31, 2010, Autodesk was invested in The Reserve International Liquidity Fund (the International Fund) with an estimated fair value of $10.0 million. In mid September of 2008, the International Fund ceased redemptions after net asset values of the funds decreased below $1 per share. This occurred as a result of the International Fund revaluing their holdings of debt securities issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Lehman Brothers), which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the International Fund. A third party court supervisor was appointed to oversee the accounting and payment administration of the International Fund. On November 30, 2010 a judge entered an order accepting a Settlement Agreement directing the distribution of the remaining funds. On January 20, 2011, we received substantially all of our holdings from the International Fund. At January 31, 2011, $31.3 million of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our Deferred Compensation Plan (see Note 6, Deferred Compensation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). Long term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following: stock repurchases; the acquisition of businesses, software products, or technologies complementary to 49 Table of Contents our business; capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal use software applications; and funding restructuring costs. Our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world, with a substantial amount held outside of the U.S. We believe that such dispersion is appropriate and meets our business and liquidity needs. A portion of this cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could be subject to certain taxes, including U.S. income taxes, in the event we believe repatriation to the U.S. is appropriate. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may decline in fiscal 2012 in the event of a weakening of the global economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. Our existing U.S. credit facility is currently $250.0 million of which we have no amounts outstanding. This credit facility is available for working capital and other business needs. Our revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations. We utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions. In addition, we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. As of January 31, 2011 and 2010, we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months. Contracts were primarily denominated in euros, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, British pounds and Canadian dollars. We do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The notional amount of our option and forward contracts was $401.6 million and $258.7 million at January 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at January 31, 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Total Fiscal Year2012 Fiscal Years2013 2014 Fiscal Years2015 2016 Thereafter (in millions) Operating lease obligations $ 228.7 $ 51.3 $ 76.4 $ 46.9 $ 54.1 Purchase obligations 73.3 52.0 17.7 3.6 Deferred compensation obligations 31.3 3.4 6.7 7.2 14.0 Pension obligations 20.4 2.2 4.2 4.2 9.8 Other obligations(1) 30.4 10.8 12.9 4.9 1.8 Total(2) $ 384.1 $ 119.7 $ 117.9 $ 66.8 $ 79.7 (1) Other obligations include future sabbatical obligations and asset retirement obligations. (2) This table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, certain purchase obligations as discussed below, long term deferred revenue and amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities (see Note 5 Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). 50 Table of Contents Operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities, net of sublease income, computer equipment and other equipment leases. Purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Autodesk and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations relate primarily to hosting services agreements, IT infrastructure costs, marketing costs and contractual software development services. Deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our non qualified deferred compensation plan. See Note 6 Deferred Compensation, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this plan. Pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the U.S. See Note 15, Retirement Benefit Plans, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these obligations. Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. In addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, included in cost of license and other revenue, was $12.8 million in fiscal 2011, $16.5 million in fiscal 2010 and $17.1 million in fiscal 2009. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. We provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. Historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the cumulative repurchase of up to 184.0 million shares. The purpose of the stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of Autodesk and its stockholders, and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders. The number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors, including general market conditions, the volume of employee stock option exercises, the trading price of our common stock, cash on hand and available in the U.S., and company defined trading windows. There were 2.0 million repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended January 31, 2011; during the year ended January 31, 2011 we repurchased 9.0 million shares of our common stock. At January 31, 2011, 24.5 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization. This program does not have a fixed expiration date. See Note 9, Stockholder Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 51 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities. As of January 31, 2011 we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations. We utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions. In addition, we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. As of January 31, 2011 and 2010, we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months. Contracts were primarily denominated in euros, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, British pounds and Canadian dollars. We do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The notional amount of our option and forward contracts was $401.6 million and $258.7 million at January 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions. A sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of January 31, 2011 indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2011 and 2010 would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by $31.6 million and $24.2 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at January 31, 2011 and 2010 would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by $26.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and, to a lesser extent, the market value of certain longer term securities. At January 31, 2011, we had $1,466.9 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities. With an average cash equivalent investment balance for the quarter of approximately $810.0 million, if interest rates were to increase (decrease) by 10%, this would result in a $0.2 million increase (decrease) in annual interest income. Further, at January 31, 2011, we had approximately $285.0 million invested in a longer term portfolio (with remaining maturities that may be less than one year) which, with 50 and 100 basis point moves, would result in market value changes (gains or losses) of $0.9 million and $1.8 million respectively, over a twelve month period. At January 31, 2010, we had $910.0 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities. With an average investment balance for the quarter of approximately $742.8 million, if interest rates were to increase (decrease) by 10%, this would result in a $0.1 million increase (decrease) in annual interest income. Further, at January 31, 2010, we had approximately $125.6 million invested in a longer term portfolio which, with 50 and 100 basis point moves, would result in market value changes (gains or losses) of $0.2 million over both six and 12 month periods. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk. 52 Table of Contents
