We do this by developing software for the worlds designers, architects, engineers, and digital artiststhe people who create the worlds products, buildings, infrastructure, films, and games. Autodesk serves customers in three primary markets: architecture, engineering and construction; manufacturing; and digital media and entertainment.Our goal is to provide our customers with the worlds most valuable, innovative, and engaging software and services. Our product and services portfolio allow our customers to digitally visualize, simulate, and analyze their projects, helping them to better understand the consequences of their design decisions; save time, money, and resources; and become more innovative.Today, complex challenges such as globalization, urbanization, and sustainable design are driving our customers to new levels of performance and competitiveness, and we are committed to helping them address those challenges and take advantage of new opportunities. To achieve these goals, we are capitalizing on two of our strongest competitive advantages: our ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets, and the breadth and depth of our product portfolio.By innovating in existing technology categories, we bring powerful new design capabilities to volume markets. Our products are designed to be easy to learn and use, and to provide customers with a low cost of deployment, a low total cost of ownership, and a rapid return on investment. In addition, our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products. The breadth of our technology and product line gives us a unique competitive advantage, because it allows our customers to address a wide variety of problems in ways that transcend industry and disciplinary boundaries. This is particularly important in helping our customers address the complex challenges mentioned above. We also believe that our technological leadership and global brand recognition have positioned us well for long term growth and industry leadership.In addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology, our large global network of distributors, resellers, third party developers, customers, educational institutions, faculty and students is a key competitive advantage. This network of relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world. Our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase, deploy, learn, and support our products quickly and easily. We have a significant number of registered third party developers who create products that work well with Autodesk products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications. Users with expertise in our products are broadly and globally available from educational institutions and in the existing workforce. We offer extensive educational programs, including student versions of software, curricula, and faculty development. We have an extensive global community of students who are experienced with our software and poised to become the next generation of professional users thus reducing the cost 27Table of Contents of training and providing fresh talent for our customers. Our global network of distributors, resellers, third party developers, customers, educational institutions and students has been developed over our twenty nine year history. We believe it is an enduring competitive advantage that is difficult for others to replicate.We continually strive to increase the business value of our design tools to our customers in a number of ways. First, we seek to address an increasing portion of our customers workflow with products that extend the value of our customers digital design information into visualization, analysis and simulation. Second, we seek to improve our product interoperability and usability, thus improving our customers productivity and effectiveness. Third, we continue to develop new ways to deliver capability and value to our customers, such as product suites, cloud based services, and delivery of our solutions on mobile devices and new hardware platforms. Fourth, we extend our customers workflow with products for adjacent users and for the customers of our customers, thus increasing the value of the design information our customers produce. Finally, we continue to develop new lines of consumer products and services that are delivered and experienced through the Web, tablets, and mobile devices providing our advanced visualization technologies to consumersa whole new category of Autodesk customer.Autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframes and engineering workstations to personal computers. We developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer. Just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry thirty years ago, we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud, mobile and social computing. Our growth strategy is predicated upon leading the transition in the industries we serve into the cloud in three ways: Grow. We believe sufficient opportunity remains in our PC based software business and intend to continue to grow this business. In particular we are offering product suites with improved interoperability and usability to enhance our customers productivity. We are continuing to drive maintenance and new licensing models to better match the business needs of our customers. We will continue emphasis on developing direct relationships with large, global customers and growing in emerging economies. Transform. At the same time we grow our desktop software business, we are migrating many of our products to the cloud. This entails development of new cloud computing infrastructure and restructuring our applications to leverage the cloud. We are also developing new capabilities that are enabled by the cloud such as collaborative PLM and on line simulation. Our goal is to lead our industry in transitioning to the cloud. Expand. We believe that the combination of cloud, mobile, and social computing affords us the opportunity to expand our business into new markets. Our consumer business is an example of this where we have added new customers. We intend to continue to develop businesses such as this to both add new customers and find new capabilities to incorporate in our core business.We believe that expanding our customers portfolios to include our suites presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy. As our customers in all industries adopt our design suites, we believe they will experience an increase in their productivity and the value of their design data. For fiscal 2012, revenue from Suites increased 31%, as compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of revenue, suites increased to 27% in fiscal 2012 as compared to 23% in fiscal 2011. Expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy. While emerging economies are important for all global businesses, we believe they hold special opportunity for Autodesk. Much of the growth in the worlds construction and manufacturing is happening in emerging economies. Further, emerging economies face many of the challenges that our design technology can help address, for example infrastructure build out. We believe that emerging economies continue to present long term growth opportunities for us and revenue from emerging countries increased 16% during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Revenue from emerging countries represented 16% and 15% of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 net revenue, respectively. While we believe there are long term growth opportunities in emerging economies, conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges, including economic volatility, geopolitical risk, local competition, intellectual property protection, poorly developed business infrastructure, scarcity of talent and software piracy.Our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology and businesses. Acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers; however, they entail cost and integration challenges and may, in certain instances, negatively impact our operating margins. We continually review these trade offs in making decisions regarding acquisitions. We currently anticipate that we will acquire products, technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available. In fiscal 2012, we increased the number, pace and dollars spent on acquisitions in comparison to fiscal 2011, but our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs, the availability of suitable sellers and technology, and our own financial condition.28Table of Contents Our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions, including that we will be able to continue making our technology available to mainstream markets; leverage our large global network of distributors, resellers, third party developers, customers, educational institutions, and students; improve the performance and functionality of our products; and adequately protect our intellectual property. If the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations, we may not be able to implement our strategy, which could potentially adversely affect our business. For further discussion regarding these and related risks see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We regularly reevaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that of all our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.For multiple element arrangements, we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method, under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value. VSOE is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority. If we do not have VSOE of an undelivered software license, we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have VSOE are delivered. If we do not have VSOE for undelivered maintenance or services, the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual service period in the arrangement. We are required to exercise judgment in determining whether VSOE exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent.Our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition. If we do not believe that collection is probable, the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received.Our indirect channel model includes both a two tiered distribution structure, where distributors sell to resellers, and a one tiered structure where Autodesk sells directly to resellers. Our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor, in a two tiered structure, or reseller, in a one tiered structure, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. This policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns, among other criteria. We are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. Our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.Marketable Securities. At January 31, 2012 we had $447.2 million of short and long term marketable securities. Marketable securities are stated at fair value. As described in Note 2, Financial Instruments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we estimate the fair value of our marketable securities each quarter. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When identical or similar assets are traded in active markets, the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low. This is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities, which we consider to be Level 1 assets and Level 2 assets. However, determining the fair value of marketable securities when observable inputs are not available (Level 3) requires significant judgment. For example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our convertible debt securities because an active market does not exist for these securities which have been issued by private corporations. These assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment. Whenever possible, we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available, when determining fair value. 29Table of Contents Business Combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to assets and liabilities, as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations.Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from sales, maintenance agreements and acquired developed technologies; the acquired companys trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio; expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; and discount rates.Goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. When assessing goodwill for impairment, we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired, or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges.As of January 31, 2012, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill, nor result in impairment of goodwill. For further discussion see Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Realizability of Long Lived Assets. We assess the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. We consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget; shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and the results of past impairment reviews.We assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models, which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows, we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on long lived assets. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values.In addition to our recoverability assessments, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.We will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges.Income Taxes. We currently have $165.9 million of net deferred tax assets, primarily a result of tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, purchased technologies and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by the establishment of U.S. deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, deferred tax liabilities associated with tax method change on advanced payments and valuation allowances against California and Canadian deferred tax assets. We perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors, including intercompany transfer pricing adjustments. Any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made. We believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. It is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate. Stock Based Compensation. We measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award, and recognize expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate 30Table of Contents the fair value of stock based payment awards (including grants of stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan) using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. The determination of the fair value of a stock based award on the date of grant using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends. The variables used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted, as needed. Share based compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our commons stock on the date of grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.Legal Contingencies. As described in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Part II, Item 8, Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings. We routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. Because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Part II, Item 8, Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference.Overview of Fiscal 2012 Fiscal Year Ended As a % of NetRevenue Fiscal Year Ended As a % of NetRevenue January 31, 2012 January 31, 2011 (in millions)Net Revenue$2,215.6 100% $1,951.8 100%Cost of revenue229.1 10% 196.6 10%Gross Profit1,986.5 90% 1,755.2 90%Operating expenses1,630.9 74% 1,483.8 76%Income from Operations$355.6 16% $271.4 14%Our business grew year over year as evidenced by our increases in revenue, gross profit and income from operations. During fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, net revenue increased 14%, gross profit increased 13% and income from operations increased 31%. Contributing to the year over year increases in revenue were increases in revenue from new seat licenses, maintenance revenue, revenue for most of our major products, all of our reportable segments, and all of our geographies during fiscal 2012 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The reasons for these increases are discussed below under the heading "Results from Operations." In addition, we continued to make progress in controlling our operating costs, which led to year over year improvements in profitability. The 31% increase in income from operations in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was due to the increase in our net revenue, while controlling the growth of operating expenses. Our total operating margin increased as a percentage from 14% for fiscal 2011 to 16% for fiscal 2012. The increase in our operating margin was primarily due to net revenue increasing at a faster rate than the increase in our costs due to our cost containment efforts during fiscal 2012. Net revenue increased $263.8 million or 14% for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, while our operating expenses increased $147.1 million, or 10% for fiscal 2012. The 10% increase in operating expenses in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was due to an increase in salaries and benefits related to increased headcount and the return of employee costs which were temporarily suppressed in the prior year through salary reductions, employee incentives reductions and mandatory vacation, and other costs associated with higher revenue. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring charges of $12.1 million.We believe net revenue for fiscal 2013 will increase by approximately 10% compared to fiscal 2012. We anticipate fiscal 2013 operating margin will increase by approximately 130 basis points compared to fiscal 2012. We generate a significant amount of our revenue in the U.S., Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and France. Included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency. Our revenue benefited from foreign exchange 31Table of Contents rate changes during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. Had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2011 been in effect during fiscal 2012 and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from fiscal 2012, (on a constant currency basis), net revenue would have increased 12% compared to the prior fiscal year. During fiscal 2012, total spend, defined as cost of revenue plus operating expenses, increased 11% compared to the prior fiscal year as reported and increased 13% on a constant currency basis. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue, total spend and income from operations in future periods. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions, but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuation of such foreign currency against the U.S. dollar.We rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the U.S. and international regions, including Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates (collectively, Tech Data). Tech Data accounted for 17% and 16% of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2012 and 2011, respectively. On October 27, 2011, Tech Data purchased certain assets of Mensch und Maschine Software (MuM), which has been a distributor of our products in Europe. The acquisition concentrates additional sales through Tech Data, which on a consolidated basis would have accounted for 21% and 22% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2011.We believe our business is not substantially dependent on Tech Data. Our customers through Tech Data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services. Should any of the agreements between us and Tech Data be terminated for any reason, we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through Tech Data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue.Our primary goals for fiscal 2013 are to grow revenue and improve our operating margin percentage by delivering our market leading products and solutions to our customers and investing in product functionality and new product lines, including suites offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will achieve our financial goals and improve our financial results. Additionally, we believe that unemployment rates and the availability of credit to major industries we serve are important indicators for our business; if global economic conditions deteriorate we may not achieve our financial goals. Revenue from flagship products was 58% of total net revenue during fiscal 2012, respectively, and increased 8% for fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. Revenue from suites was 27% of total net revenue for fiscal 2012, and increased 31% as compared to fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, we released our new design and creation suites that include English language versions of our Autodesk Design Suite, Autodesk Factory Design Suite, Autodesk Product Design Suite, Autodesk Building Design Suite, Autodesk Entertainment Creation Suite, Autodesk Infrastructure Design Suite and Autodesk Plant Design Suite, as well as a Japanese language version of our Autodesk Entertainment Creation Suite. Suites revenue and growth rates for suites consist primarily of revenue from our pre existing suite families, such as Inventor and Revit suites. Revenue from new and adjacent products was 16% of total net revenue during the fiscal 2012, and increased 8% as compared to fiscal 2011. We anticipate, as our new and existing customers migrate from our stand alone products, that our revenue from suites will increase as a percentage of revenue and that our revenue from our flagship and new and adjacent products will decline as a percentage of revenue. At January 31, 2012, we had $1,604.1 million in cash and marketable securities. We completed fiscal 2012 with a higher deferred revenue balance and a higher accounts receivable balance as compared to fiscal 2011. Our deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2012 included $633.3 million of customer maintenance contracts, which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts. Our maintenance contracts are for a term of one year, but may be two or three year, or occasionally as long as five year terms. We repurchased 9.7 million shares of our common stock for $327.4 million during fiscal 2012. Comparatively, we repurchased 9.0 million shares of our common stock for $280.3 million during fiscal 2011.32Table of Contents Results of OperationsNet Revenue Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2012 Increase compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2011 Increase (decrease)compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010 $ % $ % (in millions)Net Revenue: License and other$1,357.6 $185.5 16% $1,172.1 $191.4 20 % $980.7Maintenance858.0 78.3 10% 779.7 46.7 6 % 733.0 $2,215.6 $263.8 14% $1,951.8 $238.1 14 % $1,713.7Net Revenue by Geographic Area: Americas$798.5 $97.0 14% $701.5 $47.1 7 % $654.4Europe, Middle East and Africa862.2 79.4 10% 782.8 111.7 17 % 671.1Asia Pacific554.9 87.4 19% 467.5 79.3 20 % 388.2 $2,215.6 $263.8 14% $1,951.8 $238.1 14 % $1,713.7Net Revenue by Operating Segment: Platform Solutions and Emerging Business$833.1 $116.9 16% $716.2 $92.2 15 % $624.0Architecture, Engineering and Construction626.4 58.4 10% 568.0 54.7 11 % 513.3Manufacturing540.3 70.3 15% 470.0 83.1 22 % 386.9Media and Entertainment215.8 18.2 9% 197.6 8.5 4 % 189.1Other (0.4) (100)% 0.4 $2,215.6 $263.8 14% $1,951.8 $238.1 14 % $1,713.7Fiscal 2012 Net Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net RevenueLicense and Other RevenueLicense and other revenue is comprised of two components: all forms of product license revenue and other revenue. Product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seat licenses and upgrades. Other revenue consists of revenue from Creative Finishing, consulting and training services and hosted technology solutions.Total license and other revenue increased 16% during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily due to the 16% increase in revenue from commercial new seat licenses during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, 13 percentage points of the 16% increase was due to the increase in the number of seats sold, and 3 percentage points was due to an increase in the average net revenue per seat. Commercial new seat revenue, as a percentage of license and other revenue, was 67% for both fiscal 2012 and 2011.Also contributing to the increase in license and other revenue during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was the 14% increase in upgrade revenue. Upgrade revenue increased during fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011 primarily due to an ACAD LT upgrade promotion during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, an increase in large enterprise transactions, customers migrating from stand alone products to suites and a promotion that was run related to the education solutions suites.Backlog related to current software license product orders that had not shipped at the end of the quarter decreased by $0.4 million during fiscal 2012 from $27.5 million at January 31, 2011 to $27.1 million at January 31, 2012. Backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period.Revenue from the sales of our services, training and support, included in License and other revenue, represented less than 3% of net revenue for all periods presented.33Table of Contents Maintenance RevenueOur maintenance revenue relates to a program known by our user community as the Subscription Program. Our maintenance program provides our commercial and educational customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts. Under our maintenance program, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available, downloadable training courses and online support. We recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods.Maintenance revenue increased 10% during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to a 10% increase in commercial maintenance revenue. The 10% increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to an 8 percentage point increase in commercial enrollment during the corresponding maintenance contract term and a 2 percentage point increase in net revenue per maintenance seat. Commercial maintenance revenue represented 98% of maintenance revenue for both fiscal 2012 and 2011. Total subscription program enrollment at January 31, 2012 and 2011 consisted of about 3.2 million users and 2.9 million users, respectively.Changes in maintenance revenue lag changes in net billings for maintenance contracts because we recognize the revenue from those contracts ratably over their contract terms. Our maintenance contracts are for a term of predominantly one year, but may be two or three year, or occasionally as long as five year, terms. Net maintenance billings increased 19% during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. This increase was due to an increase in maintenance renewals, new multi year maintenance contracts, and the impact from the upgrade promotions mentioned above in "License and Other Revenue." Deferred revenue for fiscal 2012 and 2011 was $719.2 million and $587.9 million, respectively. Deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue. To a lesser extent, deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from hosted technology solutions, consulting services and deferred license sales.Net Revenue by Geographic AreaNet revenue in the Americas geography increased by 14% both as reported and constant currency basis, during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily due to a 14% increase in revenue from new seats during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Maintenance revenue increased 10% during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. This increase in our revenue in this geography was led by the U.S. and Canada. Net revenue in the EMEA geography increased by 10% both as reported and constant currency basis, during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to a 14% increase in new seat revenue and a 6% increase in maintenance revenue. The increase in our revenue in this geography was led by the Russian Federation, Belgium, United Kingdom and Germany.Net revenue in the APAC geography increased by 19%, or 12% on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to a 20% increase in new seat revenue and a 21% increase in maintenance revenue. Net revenue expansion in the APAC geography during fiscal 2012 occurred in virtually all countries, led by Japan and followed by Australia and South Korea.Net revenue in emerging economies increased by 16%, or 13% on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to revenue from the Russian Federation, India, Mexico, and Brazil. This growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2012. Revenue from emerging economies represented 16% of net revenue for fiscal 2012 and 15% for fiscal 2011.International net revenue represented 72% and 71% of our net revenue in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively. We believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue. Unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected, and could continue to significantly affect, our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue. Additionally, the U.S. credit rating downgrade and weak global economic conditions that have been characterized by restructuring of sovereign debt, high unemployment, and volatility in the financial markets may impact our future financial results. Net Revenue by Operating SegmentWe have four reportable segments: Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB), Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC), Manufacturing (MFG) and Media and Entertainment (M&E). We have no material inter segment revenue.34Table of Contents Net revenue for PSEB, which includes our Autodesk Design Suite, increased 16% during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to a 15% increase in revenue from our AutoCAD LT products.Net revenue for AEC increased 10% during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to a 10% increase in revenue from our Revit family of products. Net revenue for MFG increased 15% during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to a 14% increase in revenue from our Autodesk Inventor family of products and a 24% increase in our AutoCAD Electrical products.Net revenue for M&E increased 9% during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to a 15% increase in revenue from our Animation product group, which includes our Autodesk Entertainment Creation Suite, offset by a 3% decrease in revenue from Creative Finishing. The increase in Animation revenue was primarily due to a 13% increase in revenue from Autodesk Maya related products.Fiscal 2011 Net Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net RevenueLicense and Other RevenueTotal license and other revenue increased 20% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to the 31% increase in commercial new seat revenue during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, 28 percentage points of the 31% increase was due to the increase in the number of seats sold, and 3 percentage points was due to higher average net revenue per seat. Commercial new seat revenue, as a percentage of license and other revenue, was 67% and 61% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.Also contributing to the increase in license and other revenue during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was the 22% increase in upgrade revenue, which includes crossgrade revenue. Upgrade revenue was higher during fiscal 2011 primarily due to a one time increase in upgrades in response to a promotion in advance of the March 2010 increase in upgrade pricing, an additional promotion run in the Americas geography in the fourth quarter and an increase in the number of larger revenue transactions in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010.Backlog related to current software license product orders that had not shipped at the end of the quarter increased by $1.5 million during fiscal 2011 from $26.0 million at January 31, 2010 to $27.5 million at January 31, 2011. Maintenance RevenueMaintenance revenue increased 6% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 7% increase in commercial maintenance revenue. Total subscription program enrollment at January 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of about 2.9 million users and 2.2 million users, respectively.The 7% increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to a 5 percentage point increase in net revenue per maintenance seat and a 2 percentage point increase in commercial enrollment during the corresponding maintenance contract term. Commercial maintenance revenue represented 98% of maintenance revenue for both fiscal 2011 and 2010.Net maintenance billings increased 14% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was due to an increase in renewals, more new seats sold and the impact from the upgrade pricing promotion mentioned above.Deferred revenue at January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010, was $587.9 million and $516.5 million, respectively. Net Revenue by Geographic AreaNet revenue in the Americas geography increased by 7% both as reported and on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to a 33% increase in revenue from new seats during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Maintenance revenue increased 3% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The Americas was affected by slower economic growth than our other geographies, which impacted growth rates for all of our products during fiscal 2011.Net revenue in the EMEA geography increased by 17%, or 13% on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to a 24% increase in new seat revenue and a 9% increase in maintenance revenue. The EMEA geographys increase in revenue during fiscal 2011 was primarily due to economic expansion in virtually all countries in that geography. The increase in our revenue in that geography was led by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Belgium.35Table of Contents Net revenue in the APAC geography increased by 20%, or 16% on a constant currency basis, during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 24% increase in new seat revenue and a 48% increase in upgrade revenue. Net revenue expansion in the APAC geography during fiscal 2011 occurred in virtually all countries, led by Japan and followed by South Korea, Australia and India.Net revenue in emerging economies increased 17% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to revenue from China, the Russian Federation, India, Brazil and Poland. This growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2011. Revenue from emerging economies represented 15% of net revenue for both fiscal 2011 and 2010.International net revenue represented 71% of our net revenue in fiscal 2011 and 69% of our net revenue in fiscal 2010. Net Revenue by Operating SegmentWe have four reportable segments: Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB), Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC), Manufacturing (MFG) and Media and Entertainment (M&E). Location Services, which we disposed of in February 2009, is not included in any of the above reportable segments and is reflected as Other. Net revenue for PSEB increased 15% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 20% increase in revenue from both our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT products, offset by a net 21% decrease in revenue from all other PSEB products and services.Net revenue for AEC increased 11% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 24% increase in revenue from our Revit products, a 6% increase in revenue from our AutoCAD Civil 3D products, and a 27% increase in revenue from our Navisworks products.Net revenue for MFG increased 22% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 23% increase in revenue from our Autodesk Inventor products and a 28% increase in our AutoCAD Mechanical products.Net revenue for M&E increased 4% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a 5% increase in revenue from our Animation product group and a 3% increase in revenue from Creative Finishing. The increase in Animation revenue was primarily due to a 4% increase in revenue from Autodesk 3ds Max.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of Revenue Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2012 Increase compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2011 Increase (decrease)compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010 $ % $ % (in millions)Cost of revenue: License and other$187.1 $24.9 15% $162.2 $(9.8) (6)% $172.0Maintenance42.0 7.6 22% 34.4 14.6 74 % 19.8 $229.1 $32.5 17% $196.6 $4.8 3 % $191.8As a percentage of net revenue10% 10% 11%Cost of license and other revenue includes labor costs of order fulfillment and costs of fulfilling consulting and training services contracts and collaborative project management services contracts. Cost of license and other revenue also includes stock based compensation expense, direct material and overhead charges, amortization of purchased technology, professional services fees and royalties. Direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold (mainly PC based workstations for Creative Finishing in the M&E segment), costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media, printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs.Cost of license and other revenue increased 15% during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased support costs and lower margin consulting engagements. Cost of license and other revenue decreased 6% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to savings on shipping and handling costs resulting from the switch to a 36Table of Contents lower cost vendor as well as an increase in electronic order fulfillment. Cost of maintenance revenue includes labor costs of providing product support to our maintenance customers, including stock based compensation expense for these employees, rent and occupancy, shipping and handling costs and professional services fees. Cost of maintenance revenue increased 22% during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to an increase in maintenance support headcount and increased annual fulfillment costs related to supplying USB flash drives of our suites products. Cost of maintenance revenue increased 74% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to an increase in maintenance support headcount. These increases were partially offset by savings on freight and materials costs as fewer maintenance customers require physical shipments than in the past due to electronic fulfillment.Cost of revenue, at least over the near term, is affected by the volume and mix of product sales, mix of physical versus electronic fulfillment, fluctuations in consulting costs, amortization of purchased technology, new customer support offerings, royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products, and employee stock based compensation expense. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars, but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.Marketing and Sales Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2012 Increase compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2011 Increase compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010 $ % $ % (in millions)Marketing and sales$842.6 $66.6 9% $776.0 $44.1 6% $731.9As a percentage of net revenue38% 40% 43%Marketing and sales expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock based compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees, and the expense of travel, entertainment and training for such personnel, and the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows and expositions, and various sales and promotional programs. Marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs of sales and order processing, sales and dealer commissions, rent and occupancy, and the cost of supplies and equipment. Marketing and sales expenses increased 9% during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to higher employee related costs related to salaries and fringe benefits primarily associated with increased head count and the reinstatement of merit increases in fiscal 2012. Marketing and sales expenses increased 6% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to higher employee related costs related to variable compensation, including commissions, bonuses and related fringe benefits. Variable compensation expenses increased as a result of exceeding our fiscal 2011 target revenue growth and operating margins growth targets more than we did in fiscal 2010. Our annual incentive plans are based on forecasted revenue and operating margin, with current year targets set at the beginning of the fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in advertising and promotion spending and stock based compensation expense.We expect to balance our need to invest in the marketing and sales of our products with our desire to actively manage our sales and marketing operating expenses. As a result, we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.Research and Development Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2012 Increase compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2011 Increase compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010 $ % $ % (in millions)Research and development$566.5 $70.3 14% $496.2 $38.7 8% $457.5As a percentage of net revenue26% 25% 27%Research and development expenses, which are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits and 37Table of Contents stock based compensation expense for research and development employees, and the expense of travel, entertainment and training for such personnel, rent and occupancy, professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors. Research and development expenses increased 14% during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to an increase in salaries and fringe benefits primarily associated with increased headcount and the reinstatement of merit increases in fiscal 2012, and to an increase in professional service fees in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Research and development expenses increased 8% during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in bonuses, salaries and benefits. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, as we continue to invest in product development and acquire new technology in fiscal 2013.General and Administrative Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2012 Increase compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2011 Increase compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010 $ % $ % (in millions)General and administrative$223.1 $22.3 11% $200.8 $3.1 2% $197.7As a percentage of net revenue10% 10% 12%General and administrative expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock based compensation expense for our finance, human resources and legal employees, as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services, amortization of acquisition related customer relationships and trade names, expense of travel, entertainment and training, expense of communication and the cost of supplies and equipment. General and administrative expenses increased 11% from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in amortization of acquisition related customer relationships and trade names and the increase in salaries primarily associated with increased head count and the reinstatement of merit increases in fiscal 2012. General and administrative expenses increased 2% from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 primarily due to an increase in bonuses and salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars, but remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.Restructuring Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2012 Decrease compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2011 Decrease compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010 $ % $ % (in millions)Restructuring$(1.3) $(12.1) (112)% $10.8 $(37.4) (78)% $48.2As a percentage of net revenue % 1% 3%During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 we initiated restructuring plans in order to further reduce operating costs. These restructuring plans resulted in targeted global staff reductions of approximately 200, 430 and 700 positions for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. No leased facilities were consolidated as part of the fiscal 2011 restructuring plan. The fiscal 2010 and 2009 restructuring plans resulted in the consolidation of approximately 32 and 27 leased facilities, respectively. In connection with these restructuring programs, we recorded a favorable adjustment for changes in previous estimates of $1.3 million in fiscal 2012 and we recorded restructuring related charges of $10.8 million and $48.2 million during fiscal 2011 and 38Table of Contents 2010, respectively. The one time termination benefits for these three restructuring programs were substantially paid as of January 31, 2011. We expect to pay the facility related liabilities through fiscal 2018. See Note 15, Restructuring Reserves, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2012 Increase compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2011 Decrease compared toprior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010 $ % $ % (in millions)Impairment of goodwill$ $ % $ $(21.0) (100)% $21.0As a percentage of net revenue% % 1%We did not record an impairment charge during fiscal 2012 or 2011. During fiscal 2010, we recorded an impairment charge of $21.0 million representing the entire goodwill balance of our M&E segment as of April 30, 2009. This goodwill balance related to our M&E segments fourth quarter fiscal 2009 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Softimage. Should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future, additional impairment charges may be recorded to goodwill. As of January 31, 2012, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill, nor result in impairment of goodwill. See Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Interest and Other Income, NetThe following table sets forth the components of interest and other income, net: Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in millions)Interest and investment income, net$5.7 $10.9 $10.0Gain (loss) on foreign currency(1.1) (14.0) 5.0Other income2.7 3.7 4.1Interest and other income, net$7.3 $0.6 $19.1Interest and other income, net, increased $6.7 million during fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to improved foreign currency remeasurements. The loss on foreign currency in fiscal 2012 and 2011 is primarily due to the impact of re measuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency of the corresponding entity. The amount of gain (loss) on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the period.Interest and investment income, net, fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances, average maturities and interest rates. The decrease in Interest and investment income, net, during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our trading securities that are marked to market each period. Interest and other income, net, decreased $18.5 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to foreign currency losses. Provision for Income TaxesWe account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse.Our effective tax rate was 21% and 22% during fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our effective tax rate decreased one percentage point from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, partially offset by tax benefits associated with closure of audits in fiscal 39Table of Contents 2011. Our effective tax rate was 22% and 32% during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our effective tax rate decreased 10 percentage points from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 primarily due to a change in expected future tax rates, the establishment of the California valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 and a decrease in non deductible stock based compensation expense, offset by a decrease in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the State of California enacted legislation significantly altering California tax law. As a result of the newly enacted legislation, we expect that in fiscal years 2012 and beyond, income subject to tax in California will be less than under prior tax law and accordingly, deferred tax assets are less likely to be realized.Our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate, research credits, state income taxes, the tax impact of stock based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, U.S. Manufacturers deduction, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax laws including possible U.S. tax law changes that, if enacted, could significantly impact how U.S. multinational companies are taxed on foreign subsidiary earnings. A significant amount of our earnings is generated by our Europe and Asia Pacific subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or we repatriate certain foreign earnings on which U.S. taxes have not previously been provided. At January 31, 2012, we had net deferred tax assets of $165.9 million. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets.For additional information regarding our income tax provision and reconciliation of our effective rate to the federal statutory rate of 35%, see Note 4, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Financial InformationIn addition to our results determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) discussed above, we believe the following non GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, our gross profit, gross margin, income from operations, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP and non GAAP basis were as follows (in millions except for gross margin, operating margin and per share data): January 31, 2012 January 31, 2011 January 31, 2010 (Unaudited) Gross profit$1,986.5 $1,755.2 $1,521.9Non GAAP gross profit$2,028.4 $1,790.0 $1,557.9Gross margin90% 90% 89%Non GAAP gross margin92% 92% 91%Income from operations$355.6 $271.4 $65.6Non GAAP income from operations$533.4 $418.8 $286.8Operating margin16% 14% 4%Non GAAP operating margin24% 21% 17%Net income$285.3 $212.0 $58.0Non GAAP net income$405.4 $310.4 $229.2Diluted earnings per share$1.22 $0.90 $0.25Non GAAP diluted earnings per share$1.74 $1.32 $0.99For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non GAAP measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis. These non GAAP measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. We use non GAAP measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential. In addition, these non GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to our and our competitors historical results and operating guidance. We also use these measures for purposes of determining company wide incentive compensation. There are limitations in using non GAAP financial measures because non GAAP financial measures are not prepared in 40Table of Contents accordance with GAAP and may be different from non GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non GAAP financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. The presentation of non GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 41Table of Contents Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non GAAP Financial Measures(In millions except for gross margin, operating margin and per share data): Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, 2012 2011 2010 (Unaudited)Gross profit$1,986.5 $1,755.2 $1,521.9Stock based compensation expense3.9 2.9 3.1Amortization of purchased intangibles(1)38.0 31.9 32.9Non GAAP gross profit$2,028.4 $1,790.0 $1,557.9Gross margin90% 90% 89%Stock based compensation expense% % %Amortization of purchased intangibles2% 2% 2%Non GAAP gross margin92% 92% 91%Income from operations$355.6 $271.4 $65.6Stock based compensation expense108.8 80.7 93.6Amortization of purchased intangibles(1)70.3 55.9 58.4Impairment of goodwill 21.0Restructuring charges(1.3) 10.8 48.2Non GAAP income from operations$533.4 $418.8 $286.8Operating margin16% 14% 4%Stock based compensation expense5% 4% 5%Amortization of purchased intangibles(1)3% 3% 4%Impairment of goodwill% % 3%Restructuring charges% % 1%Non GAAP operating margin24% 21% 17%Net income$285.3 $212.0 $58.0Stock based compensation expense108.8 80.7 93.6Amortization of purchased intangibles(1)70.3 55.9 58.4Impairment of goodwill 21.0Restructuring charges(1.3) 10.8 48.2Establishment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 21.0Discrete tax provision items(6.8) (6.0) (13.1)Income tax effect of non GAAP adjustments(50.9) (43.0) (57.9)Non GAAP net income$405.4 $310.4 $229.2Diluted net income per share$1.22 $0.90 $0.25Stock based compensation expense0.47 0.34 0.40Amortization of purchased intangibles(1)0.30 0.24 0.25Impairment of goodwill 0.09Restructuring charges(0.01) 0.05 0.21Establishment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 0.09Discrete tax provision items(0.03) (0.03) (0.04)Income tax effect of non GAAP adjustments(0.21) (0.18) (0.26)Non GAAP diluted net income per share$1.74 $1.32 $0.99 (1)Amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of purchased developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names for acquisitions subsequent to December 2005.42Table of Contents Our non GAAP financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following:Stock based compensation expenses. We exclude stock based compensation expenses from non GAAP measures primarily because they are non cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.Amortization of purchased intangibles. We incur amortization of acquisition related purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. The amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity and management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Goodwill impairment. This is a non cash charge to write down goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired. As explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.Restructuring charges. These expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions. In connection with these restructuring actions, we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated, and the closure of facilities and cancelation of certain contracts. We exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing financial results in the current period.Establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets. This is a non cash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. As explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.Discrete tax items. We exclude the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the non GAAP measure of income, and include a non GAAP tax provision based upon the projected annual non GAAP effective tax rate. Discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year, unusual or infrequently occurring items, or the tax impact of certain stock based compensation. Examples of discrete tax items include, but are not limited to, certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years, certain costs related to business combinations, certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law. Management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations. Income tax effects on the difference between GAAP and non GAAP costs and expenses. The income tax effects that are excluded from the non GAAP measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between GAAP and non GAAP costs and expenses, primarily due to stock based compensation, purchased intangibles and restructuring for GAAP and non GAAP measures. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs. In addition to operating expenses, we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives, which include acquisitions of products, technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program. See further discussion of these items below.At January 31, 2012, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1,604.1 million and net accounts receivable of $395.1 million. In addition, we have a line of credit facility that permitted unsecured short term borrowings of up to $400.0 million that we entered into in May 2011, which replaced our previous $250.0 million line of credit facility that would have expired in August 2012. During fiscal 2012, we had no borrowings or repayments under our current or prior line of credit facility. This credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes and expires in May 2016. Our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally. Our primary commercial banking relationship is with Citibank and its global affiliates (Citibank). In addition, Citibank is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our $400.0 million line of credit. The increase in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to $1,604.1 million at January 31, 2012 from $1,466.9 million at January 31, 2011 is principally the result of cash generated from operations and to a lesser extent, the proceeds from the issuance of common stock following stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases. These increases to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock, acquisitions including business combinations and technology purchases, capital expenditures, and other investing 43Table of Contents activities. Cash generated from operations was positively impacted by higher net revenue.The primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of $573.5 million for fiscal 2012 was net income of$285.3 million increased by the effect of non cash expenses totaling $224.3 million associated with depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation. In addition, net cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was $96.7 million. The primary source of working capital was an increase in deferred revenue due to higher maintenance billings and an increase in accounts payable for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in accounts receivable due to higher billings and the reduction of accrued expenses primarily related to accrued commissions in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was 61 at January 31, 2012 compared to 55 at January 31, 2011. The increase in days sales outstanding is due to higher billings in the last month of fiscal 2012 compared to the last month of fiscal 2011.At January 31, 2012, our short term investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of $254.4 million and a cost basis of $252.6 million. The portfolio fair value consisted of $143.8 million invested in commercial paper and corporate securities, $38.2 million invested in U.S. government agency securities, $31.5 million invested in mutual funds, $5.2 million invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase greater than 90 days and less than one year, $30.7 million invested in U.S treasury securities, $4.7 million invested in municipal securities and $0.3 million invested in other short term securities.At January 31, 2012, $31.5 million of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our Deferred Compensation Plan (see Note 6, Deferred Compensation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).Long term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following: the acquisition of businesses, software products, or technologies complementary to our business; stock repurchases; and capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal use software applications.Our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology and businesses. Acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers; however, they entail cost and integration challenges and may, in certain instances, negatively impact our operating margins. We continually review these trade offs in making decisions regarding acquisitions. We currently anticipate that we will acquire products, technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available. In fiscal 2012, we increased the number, pace and dollars spent on acquisitions in comparison to fiscal 2011, but our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs, the availability of suitable sellers and technology, and our own financial condition.Our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are primarily denominated and held in U.S. dollar and are concentrated in a few locations around the world, with substantial amounts held outside of the U.S. We believe that such dispersion meets our business and liquidity needs. Certain amounts held outside the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. (subject to local law restrictions), but under current U.S. tax law, could be subject to U.S. income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. We have provided for the U.S. income tax liability on foreign earnings, except for foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the U.S. will remain outside the U.S. and we will meet our U.S. liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may decline in fiscal 2013 in the event of a weakening of the global economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our existing credit facility at March 15, 2012 is $400.0 million of which we have no amounts outstanding. This credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations. We utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions. In addition, we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011, we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months. Contracts were primarily denominated in euros, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, British pounds, 44Table of Contents Canadian dollars, and Australian dollars. We do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The notional amount of our option and forward contracts was $494.7 million and $401.6 million at January 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at January 31, 2012 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Total Fiscal 2013 Fiscal Years 2014 2015 Fiscal Years 2016 2017 Thereafter (in millions) Operating lease obligations$237.6 $49.4 $74.4 $53.9 $59.9Purchase obligations53.5 45.9 7.6 Deferred compensation obligations31.5 3.2 7.6 5.0 15.7Pension obligations18.1 2.0 4.6 3.6 7.9Other obligations(1)36.0 16.9 13.0 4.8 1.3Total(2)$376.7 $117.4 $107.2 $67.3 $84.8 (1)Other obligations include future sabbatical obligations and asset retirement obligations.(2)This table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, certain purchase obligations as discussed below, long term deferred revenue and amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities (see Note 4, Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).Operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities, net of sublease income, computer equipment and other equipment leases.Purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Autodesk and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations relate primarily to hosting services agreements, IT infrastructure costs, and marketing costs.Deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our non qualified deferred compensation plan. See Note 6, Deferred Compensation, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this plan.Pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the U.S. See Note 14, Retirement Benefit Plans, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these obligations.Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. In addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations.We provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. Historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations.Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesThe purpose of the stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of Autodesk and its stockholders, and has the effect 45Table of Contents of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders. The number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors, including general market conditions, the volume of employee stock option exercises, stock issuance, the trading price of our common stock, cash on hand and available in the U.S., and company defined trading windows. There were 2.0 million repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended January 31, 2012; during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012 we repurchased 9.7 million shares of our common stock. At January 31, 2012, 14.7 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization. This program does not have a fixed expiration date. See Note 9, Stockholders Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsOther than operating leases, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities. As of January 31, 2012 we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign currency exchange riskOur revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations. We utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions. In addition, we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011, we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months. Contracts were primarily denominated in euros, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, British pounds, Canadian dollars, and Australian dollars. We do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The notional amount of our option and forward contracts was $494.7 million and $401.6 million at January 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.We utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions. A sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of January 31, 2012 indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2012 and 2011 would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by $45.3 million and $31.6 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at January 31, 2012 and 2011 would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by $24.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively.Interest rate riskInterest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and, to a lesser extent, the market value of certain longer term securities. At January 31, 2012, we had $1,300.8 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities. With an average investment balance for the quarter of approximately $1,236.5 million, if interest rates were to change by 10%, this would result in a $0.2 million change in annual interest income. Further, at January 31, 2012, we had approximately $211.5 million invested in a longer term portfolio (with remaining maturities that may be less than one year) which, with 50 and 100 basis point moves, would result in market value changes (gains or losses) of $2.0 million and $4.0 million respectively, over a twelve month period. At January 31, 2011, we had $1,149.9 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities. With an average investment balance for the quarter of approximately $810.0 million, if interest rates were to change by 10%, this would result in a $0.2 million change in annual interest income. Further, at January 31, 2011, we had approximately $285.0 million invested in a longer term portfolio (with remaining maturities that may be less than one year) which, with 50 and 100 basis point moves, would result in market value changes (gains or losses) of $0.9 million and $1.8 million respectively, over a twelve month period.46Table of Contents
