ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Executive Summary As we began 2003, Ameren was faced with a weak economy and energy market, electric rate reductions in our Missouri service territory and rising employee benefit costs. To tackle these challenges, we initiated a voluntary retirement program that reduced staffing levels by over 500 people, closed inefficient generating units, took steps to reduce employee benefit costs and focused on cost containment throughout our business. While decisions to undertake these initiatives were difficult, management felt they were necessary to meet investors expectations and better position Ameren for the future so as to benefit all of our stakeholders. Strong operating performance at our power plants during 2003 permitted Ameren to offset reduced sales due to milder than normal summer weather and to take advantage of better than expected interchange power prices. In 2003, our plants produced more electricity in a single year than ever before, resulting in an increased contribution from interchange sales. In 2003, we also successfully completed the acquisition and integration of CILCORP, realizing anticipated synergies. With the addition of CILCORP, Ameren now serves over 1.7 million electric and over 500,000 natural gas customers in Missouri and Illinois. We are the largest electric utility in Missouri and the second largest electric utility in Illinois. In February 2004, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase from Dynegy the stock of Illinois Power and an additional 20% interest in EEI. We believe Illinois Power is an excellent strategic fit with our core transmission and distribution business and the additional interest in EEI will bring us more value from EEIs low cost generation plant. The acquisition of Illinois Power will add approximately 590,000 electric customers and 415,000 gas customers. Subject to regulatory approval, we expect to complete the acquisition by the end of 2004. We expect factors positively impacting 2004 earnings to include, among other things, sales growth in our service territory, almost $30 million in gas rate increases for our gas operations, incremental synergies from the CILCORP acquisition and continued cost control. Factors negatively impacting 2004 earnings are expected to be the implementation of a $30 million reduction in annual electric revenues in Missouri in April 2004, a Callaway Nuclear Plant refueling outage in the spring of 2004, and rising employee benefit costs. Our 2004 earnings will also be affected by the short term dilutive effect of the issuance of common shares in February 2004, the proceeds of which are intended to be ultimately used for the acquisitions of Illinois Power and the 20% interest in EEI. However, once completed, we expect these acquisitions to increase our earnings per share. General Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company registered with the SEC under the PUHCA. Amerens primary asset is the common stock of its subsidiaries. Amerens subsidiaries operate rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses, rate regulated natural gas distribution businesses and non rate regulated electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Amerens common stock are dependent on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. Amerens Registrants are listed below. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements for a detailed description of our principal subsidiaries. Also see the Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations. o UE, also known as Union Electric Company, operates a rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution business, and a rate regulated natural gas distribution business in Missouri and Illinois. o CIPS, also known as Central Illinois Public Service Company, operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. 40 o Genco, also known as Ameren Energy Generating Company, operates a non rate regulated electric generation business. o CILCO, also known as Central Illinois Light Company, is a subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company) and operates a rate regulated electric transmission and distribution business, a primarily non rate regulated electric generation business and a rate regulated natural gas distribution business in Illinois. When we refer to our, we or us, it indicates that the referenced information relates to Ameren and its subsidiaries. When we refer to financing or acquisition activities, we are defining Ameren as the parent holding company. When appropriate, each Registrant is specifically referenced in order to distinguish among our different business activities. The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority owned subsidiaries. Results of CILCORP and CILCO reflected in Amerens consolidated financial statements include the period from the acquisition date of January 31, 2003 through December 31, 2003. However, tabular presentation of CILCORP and CILCOs results and other discussions specific to CILCORP and CILCO represent the full twelve month period. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, unless otherwise indicated. Acquisitions CILCORP and Medina Valley On January 31, 2003, Ameren completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of CILCORP from AES. CILCORP is the parent company of Peoria, Illinois based CILCO. With the acquisition, CILCO became an indirect Ameren subsidiary, but remains a separate utility company, operating as AmerenCILCO. On February 4, 2003, Ameren also completed the acquisition of Medina Valley, which indirectly owns a 40 megawatt, gas fired electric generation plant. The results of operations for CILCORP and Medina Valley were included in Amerens consolidated financial statements effective with the respective January and February 2003 acquisition dates. Ameren acquired CILCORP to complement its existing Illinois gas and electric operations. The purchase included CILCOs rate regulated electric and natural gas businesses in Illinois serving approximately 205,000 and 210,000 customers, respectively, of which approximately 150,000 are combination electric and gas customers. CILCOs service territory is contiguous to CIPS service territory. CILCO also has a non rate regulated electric and gas marketing business principally focused in the Chicago, Illinois region. Finally, the purchase included approximately 1,200 megawatts of largely coal fired generating capacity, most of which became non rate regulated on October 3, 2003, due to CILCOs transfer of approximately 1,100 megawatts of generating capacity to AERG. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information on the transfer to AERG. The total acquisition cost was approximately $1.4 billion and included the assumption by Ameren of CILCORP and Medina Valley debt and preferred stock at closing of $895 million and consideration of $479 million in cash, net of $38 million cash acquired. The cash component of the purchase price came from Amerens issuance in September 2002 of 8.05 million common shares and its issuance in early 2003 of an additional 6.325 million common shares, which together generated aggregate net proceeds of $575 million. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. Illinois Power On February 2, 2004, we entered into an agreement with Dynegy to purchase the stock of Decatur, Illinois based Illinois Power and Dynegys 20% ownership interest in EEI. Illinois Power operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business serving approximately 590,000 electric and 415,000 gas customers in areas contiguous to our existing Illinois utility service territories. The total transaction value is approximately $2.3 billion, including the assumption of approximately $1.8 billion of Illinois Power debt and preferred stock, with the balance of the 41 purchase price to be paid in cash at closing. Ameren will place $100 million of the cash portion of the purchase price in a six year escrow pending resolution of certain contingent environmental obligations of Illinois Power and other Dynegy affiliates for which Ameren has been provided indemnification by Dynegy. Amerens financing plan for this transaction includes the issuance of new Ameren common stock, which in total, is expected to equal at least 50% of the transaction value. In February 2004, Ameren issued 19.1 million common shares that generated net proceeds of $853 million. Proceeds from this sale and future offerings are expected to be used to finance the cash portion of the purchase price, to reduce Illinois Power debt assumed as part of this transaction, to pay any related premiums and possibly to reduce present or future indebtedness and or repurchase securities of Ameren or our subsidiaries. Upon completion of the acquisition, expected by the end of 2004, Illinois Power will become an Ameren subsidiary operating as AmerenIP. The transaction is subject to the approval of the ICC, the SEC, the FERC, the Federal Communications Commission, the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions. In addition, this transaction includes a firm capacity power supply contract for Illinois Powers annual purchase of 2,800 megawatts of electricity from a subsidiary of Dynegy. This contract will extend through 2006 and is expected to supply about 75% of Illinois Powers customer requirements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, Illinois Power had revenues of $1.2 billion, operating income of $130 million, and net income applicable to its common shareholder of $88 million, and at September 30, 2003, had total assets of $2.6 billion, excluding an intercompany note receivable from its parent company of approximately $2.3 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Illinois Power had revenues of $1.5 billion, operating income of $164 million, and net income applicable to its common shareholder of $158 million, and at December 31, 2002, had total assets of $2.6 billion, excluding an intercompany note receivable from its parent company of approximately $2.3 billion. See also Liquidity and Capital Resources below for the potential impact on credit ratings that could result from the acquisition of Illinois Power. Illinois Power also files quarterly and annual reports with the SEC. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Summary Our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Weather, economic conditions and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly impact the demand for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations caused by winter heating and summer cooling demand. With approximately 90% of Amerens revenues directly subject to regulation by various state and federal agencies, decisions by regulators can have a material impact on the price we charge for our services. Our non rate regulated sales are subject to market conditions for power. We principally utilize coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas and oil in our operations. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the world economic and political environment, weather, supply and demand levels and many other factors. We do not have fuel or purchased power cost recovery mechanisms in Missouri or Illinois for our electric utility businesses, but we do have gas cost recovery mechanisms in each state for our gas utility businesses. The electric rates for UE, CIPS and CILCO are largely set through 2006 such that cost decreases or increases will not be immediately reflected in rates. In addition, the gas delivery rates for UE in Missouri are set through June 2006. Fluctuations in interest rates impact our cost of borrowing and pension and postretirement benefits. We employ various risk management strategies in order to try to reduce our exposure to commodity risks and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of our power plants, and transmission and distribution systems, and the level of operating and administrative costs, and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control in order to optimize our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Amerens net income for 2003, 2002 and 2001, was $524 million ($3.25 per share before dilution), $382 million ($2.61 per share before dilution), and $469 million ($3.41 per share before dilution), respectively. In 2003, Amerens net income included an after tax gain ($31 million or 19 cents per share) related to the settlement of a dispute over mine 42 reclamation issues with a coal supplier and a net cumulative effect after tax gain ($18 million or 11 cents per share) associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The coal contract settlement gain represented a return of coal costs plus accrued interest previously paid to a coal supplier for future reclamation of a coal mine. The SFAS No. 143 net gain resulted principally from the elimination of non legal obligation costs of removal for non rate regulated assets from accumulated depreciation. The following table presents the net cumulative effect after tax gain recorded at each of the Ameren Companies upon adoption of SFAS No. 143: Net Cumulative Effect After Tax Gain Ameren(a)................................................. $ 18 UE........................................................

(b) Represents predecessor information recorded in January 2003 prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (c) CILCOs financial statements are presented on a historical basis of accounting for all periods presented. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. In 2002, Amerens net income included restructuring charges of $58 million, net of taxes, or 40 cents per share, which consisted of a voluntary employee retirement program, the retirement of UEs Venice, Illinois plant, and the temporary suspension of operation of two coal fired generating units at Gencos Meredosia, Illinois plant. See Note 7 Restructuring Charges and Other Special Items to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. In 2001, Amerens net income was reduced by $7 million, net of taxes, or 5 cents per share, due to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The following table presents a reconciliation of Amerens net income to net income excluding restructuring charges and other special items (e.g. coal contract settlement), as well as the effect of SFAS No. 143 and SFAS No. 133 adoption, all net of taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. Ameren believes this reconciliation presents results from continuing operations on a more comparable basis. However, net income, or earnings per share, excluding these items is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies or more useful than the GAAP presentation included in Amerens financial statements. 2003 2002 2001 Net income................................................................. $ 524 $ 382 $ 469 Earnings per share basic................................................. $ 3.25 $ 2.61 $ 3.41 Restructuring charges and other special items, net of taxes...........

The change in net income was primarily due to the acquisition of CILCORP, as discussed below, favorable interchange margins (35 cents per share) due to improved power prices in the energy markets and greater low cost generation available for sale, organic growth, lower labor costs due to the voluntary 43 employee retirement program implemented in early 2003 (11 cents per share), lower maintenance expenses in Amerens pre CILCORP acquisition operations (25 cents per share), and a decrease in Other Miscellaneous Expense as a result of the expensing of economic development and energy assistance programs in the second quarter of 2002 related to the UE Missouri electric rate case settlement. These benefits to Amerens 2003 net income were partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions (estimated to be 40 to 50 cents per share) primarily due to cooler summer weather in Amerens pre CILCORP territory, an electric rate reduction in UEs Missouri service territory that went into effect in April 2003 (11 cents per share), lower sales of emission credits (7 cents per share), higher employee benefit costs and increased common shares outstanding. Excluding the charges discussed above, Amerens net income decreased $36 million (45 cents per share) in 2002 as compared to 2001, primarily due to the impact of the settlement of our Missouri electric rate case (26 cents per share), increased costs of employee benefits, higher depreciation (17 cents per share), excluding the effect of the rate case that is included in the 26 cents above, and a decline in industrial sales due to the continued soft economy. Increased average common shares outstanding (8.8 million shares) and financing costs also reduced Amerens earnings per share in 2002 (29 cents per share). Factors decreasing net income in 2002 were partially offset by favorable weather conditions (estimated to be 20 to 30 cents per share), sales of emission credits by EEI (10 cents per share) and organic growth. The impact from the acquisitions of CILCORP and Medina Valley and related financings was accretive to Amerens earnings per share in 2003 by an estimated four cents per share as Ameren realized synergies associated with the acquisitions following the integration of systems and operating practices. The amortization of non cash purchase accounting fair value adjustments at CILCORP increased Amerens and CILCORPs net income by $24 million for the eleven months ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the prior year period. The amortization of the fair value adjustments that increased net income were related to pension and postretirement liabilities, coal contract liabilities, severance liabilities and long term debt. The amortization of fair value adjustments that decreased net income were related to electric plant in service, purchased power and emission credits. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) impact on Amerens and CILCORPs net income related to the amortization of purchase accounting fair value adjustments during 2003: For the eleven months ended December 31, 2003: Statement of Income line item: Other operations and maintenance(a)........................... $ 39 Interest(b)................................................... 7 Fuel and purchased power(c)................................... 1 Depreciation and amortization(d)..............................

(b) The impact on interest of the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments is due to CILCORPs 9.375% senior notes due 2029 and 8.70% senior notes due 2009 being written up to fair value and amortized over the average remaining life of the debt. See Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information. (c) Included in fuel and purchased power are the amortization of the adjustment of emission credits to fair value amortized over 28 years and the amortization of the adjustment of coal contracts to fair value amortized over the remaining useful life of 2 years. (d) The impact on depreciation and amortization of the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments is due to the plant assets at Duck Creek, E. D. Edwards, and Sterling Avenue being written up to fair value and amortized over the remaining useful lives of the plants (Duck Creek 34 years; E. D. Edwards 27 years; and Sterling Avenue 15 years).

(b) Excludes net income prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003. January 2003 predecessor amounts were $9 million. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (c) Includes corporate general and administrative expenses, transition costs associated with the CILCORP acquisition and other non rate regulated operations. Electric Operations The following tables present the favorable (unfavorable) variations in electric margins, defined as electric revenues less fuel and purchased power, as compared to the prior periods for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Although electric margin may be considered a non GAAP measure, we believe it is a useful measure to analyze the change in profitability of our electric operations between periods. The variation for Ameren reflects the entire contribution from CILCORP as a separate line item. The variations in CILCORP and CILCO electric margins are for 2003 as compared to 2002 when Ameren did not own these companies, and they did not contribute to Amerens electric margins. 2003 versus 2002 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP(b) CILCO(c) Electric revenue change: CILCORP acquisition.................. $ 497 $ $ $ $ $ Effect of weather (estimate).........

(c) CILCOs financial statements are presented on a historical basis of accounting for all periods presented. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. (d) CILCORPs generation and other line item includes $83 million of purchase accounting adjustments related to the purchase by AES. Ameren 2003 versus 2002 Amerens electric margin increased $187 million in 2003 as compared to 2002. Increases in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to the acquisition of CILCORP, increased interchange margins and organic sales growth, partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions relative to 2002, lower sales of emission credits and rate reductions. CILCORPs electric margin for the eleven months ended December 31, 2003, was $236 million. Interchange margins increased $92 million in 2003 due to improved power prices in the energy markets and increased low cost generation availability. Average realized power prices on interchange sales increased to approximately $32 per megawatthour in 2003 from approximately $25 per megawatthour in 2002. Availability of coal fired generating plants increased to 86% in 2003 from 82% in 2002 due to fewer scheduled and unscheduled outages. In addition, there was no refueling outage at the Callaway Nuclear Plant in 2003. The unfavorable weather conditions were primarily due to cooler summer weather in the second and third quarters of 2003 versus warmer than normal conditions in the same periods in 2002. Cooling degree days were approximately 25% less in 2003 in our service territory compared to 2002 and approximately 10% less compared to normal conditions. Heating degree days in 2003 were comparable to 2002 and normal conditions. In Amerens pre CILCORP acquisition service territory, weather sensitive residential and commercial electric kilowatthour sales declined 4% and 2%, respectively, in 2003 compared to 2002. Industrial electric kilowatthour sales increased 2% in 2003 in Amerens pre CILCORP acquisition service territory due to improving economic conditions. Annual rate reductions of $50 million and $30 million were effective April 1, 2002 and 2003, respectively, as a result of the 2002 UE electric rate case settlement in Missouri, and negatively impacted electric revenues in 2003 and 2002. Revenues will be further reduced at UE by the 2002 UE settlement of the Missouri electric rate case, due to an additional $30 million of annual electric rate reduction effective April 1, 2004. EEIs revenues decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to lower emission credit sales and decreased sales to its principal customer, which also resulted in a decrease in fuel and purchased power. EEIs sales of emission credits were $10 million in 2003 as compared to $38 million in 2002. Amerens fuel and purchased power increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to increased kilowatthour sales related primarily to the addition of CILCORP. Excluding CILCORP, fuel and purchased power decreased in 2003 primarily due to the greater availability of low cost generation. 2002 versus 2001 Amerens electric margin increased $102 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. Increases in electric margin in 2002 were primarily attributable to more favorable weather conditions and increased sales of emission credits. In 2002, weather sensitive residential electric kilowatthour sales increased by 7% and commercial electric kilowatthour sales 46 increased by 2% as cooling degree days were approximately 10% greater in 2002 compared to 2001. However, industrial sales were approximately 5% lower in 2002 as compared to 2001 due primarily to the impact of the soft economy. Revenues were also reduced by $47 million in 2002 due to the settlement of UEs Missouri electric rate case. Contribution to electric margin from EEI increased in 2002 from 2001 principally due to EEIs sale of $38 million in emission credits, which is included in the overall $75 million increase in EEI revenues. The remaining EEI increase was due to increased sales to its principal customer, which also resulted in an increase in fuel and purchased power. Interchange revenues decreased in 2002 from 2001 due to lower energy prices and less low cost generation available for sale, resulting primarily from increased demand for generation from native load customers. Fuel and purchased power decreased in 2002 from 2001 due primarily to lower energy prices, partially offset by increased fuel and purchase power costs due to increased kilowatthour sales and unscheduled plant outages. During 2002, we adopted the provisions of EITF No. 02 3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," that required revenues and costs associated with certain energy contracts to be shown on a net basis in the Statement of Income. See also Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information on the impact of netting these operating revenues and costs. UE UEs electric margin decreased $27 million in 2003 as compared to 2002. Decreases in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to the unfavorable weather conditions and the rate reductions resulting from the 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement as mentioned above. However, interchange margins increased $64 million due to improved power prices in the energy markets and increased low cost generation availability as mentioned above. Fuel and purchased power in 2003 was comparable to 2002. UEs electric margin increased $70 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. Increases in electric margin in 2002 were primarily attributable to more favorable weather conditions and lower fuel and purchased power costs. Revenues decreased due to the settlement of the 2002 Missouri electric rate case as mentioned above. Interchange margins decreased due to lower energy prices and less low cost generation available for sale, resulting primarily from increased demand for generation from native load customers. Fuel and purchased power decreased due primarily to lower energy prices, partially offset by increased kilowatthour sales and unscheduled plant outages. CIPS CIPS electric margin decreased $27 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions as mentioned above and several customers switching from CIPS to Marketing Company. Commencing in 2002, all of CIPS, CILCOs and UEs Illinois residential, commercial and industrial customers had a choice in electric suppliers as provided by the Illinois Customer Choice Law. Several of CIPS commercial and industrial customers switched to Marketing Company for their energy supply resulting in a decline in CIPS revenues included in the growth and other line item in the table above of approximately $95 million and a decrease of approximately $85 million in purchased power of approximately $95 million for 2003. CIPS continues to provide electric delivery service to these customers and charges them ICC approved delivery service tariff rates for that service. There was no significant switching of customers outside the Ameren Companies in 2002 or 2003. CIPS electric margin increased $6 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to more favorable weather conditions and decreased purchased power costs attributable to lower energy prices. Partially offsetting the favorable weather were lower industrial and commercial sales related to the impact of the soft economy along with certain industrial customers electing to switch to Marketing Company as mentioned above. Genco Gencos electric margin increased $39 million in 2003 as compared to 2002. Increases in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to increased interchange margins. Interchange margins increased $33 million in 2003 due to improved power prices in the energy markets. Fuel and purchased power increased $6 million in 2003 due to higher purchased power costs associated with higher energy prices and lower generation. These increased costs were partially offset by lower generation costs due to a 12% decline in megawatthour generation. The decline in generation during 2003 was primarily attributable to the timing of outages at Gencos power plants and unexpected downtime and unfavorable margins associated with Gencos CTs. 47 Gencos electric margin decreased $20 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. Decreases in electric margin in 2002 were primarily due to lower power prices and the reduction of indirect sales to UE under the 2001 and 2002 Marketing Company UE power supply agreements, partially offset by increases in other wholesale and interchange revenues and increases in the use of lower cost generation due to better availability. See Note 14 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for discussion of our power supply agreements. Gencos power plant availability increased 9 percentage points to 89% in 2002 compared to 80% in 2001. Revenues increased in 2002 due to an increase in the volume of interchange sales for the year, although these sales provided lower margins due to lower electricity prices. In addition, a net increase in new wholesale customers added by Marketing Company and an increase in sales to existing wholesale customers increased revenues. Fuel cost increased $51 million in 2002 due primarily to increased use of coal fired generation stations due to better availability and increased wholesale demand. Purchased power costs decreased $18 million due to lower energy prices and improved plant availability. CILCORP CILCORPs electric margin decreased $13 million in 2003 as compared to 2002. Decreases in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to lower margin per megawatthour sold on a non rate regulated basis to electric customers outside of CILCOs service territory, the switch of two large CILCO customers to Marketing Company and unfavorable weather conditions as mentioned above. In addition, fuel and purchased power increased due to the net effect of purchase accounting fair value adjustments related to emission allowances and coal contracts. CILCORPs electric margin decreased $19 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. Decreases in electric margin in 2002 were primarily attributable to purchase accounting adjustments of $83 million associated with coal contracts related to the purchase of CILCORP by AES, offset by favorable weather conditions and higher margin per megawatthour sold on a non rate regulated basis to electric customers outside CILCORPs service territory. CILCO CILCOs electric margin decreased $14 million in 2003 as compared to 2002. Decreases in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to a lower margin per megawatthour sold on a non rate regulated basis to electric customers outside CILCOs service territory, the switch of two large CILCO customers to Marketing Company and unfavorable weather conditions as mentioned above. CILCOs electric margin increased $64 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. Increases in electric margin in 2002 were primarily attributable to favorable weather conditions and a higher margin per megawatthour sold on a non rate regulated basis to electric customers outside CILCOs service territory. This resulted from the termination of a higher priced supply contract that was replaced with lower cost purchases. The termination of the supply contract was unusual due to the bankruptcy of the supplier and therefore, the higher margins were not expected to continue beyond 2002. Gas Operations The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) variations in gas margins, defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale, as compared to the prior periods for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Although gas margin may be considered a non GAAP measure, we believe it is a useful measure to analyze the change in profitability of gas operations between periods. 2003 2002 Ameren(a)............................ $ 74 $ (3) UE...................................

(c) CILCOs financial statements are presented on a historical basis of accounting for all periods presented. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. 48 Amerens gas margin increased in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to the acquisition of CILCORP (eleven months ended December 31, 2003 $73 million). The gas margins at UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 were comparable to 2002 as heating degree days were consistent with 2002. Amerens and UEs gas margins decreased in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to warmer winter weather in early 2002, partially offset by increased gas sales due to colder than normal temperatures in late 2002. The gas margins at CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO increased due to a decrease in gas costs attributable to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by warmer winter weather in early 2002 as compared to normal.

(c) CILCOs financial statements are presented on a historical basis of accounting for all periods presented. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. Other Operations and Maintenance Ameren Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $64 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to the addition of CILCORP (eleven months ended December 31, 2003 $135 million), transition costs related to the CILCORP acquisition, higher employee benefit costs ($17 million) and a net increase in injuries and damages costs based on claims experience ($6 million). These increases in other operations and maintenance expenses were partially offset by lower labor costs resulting primarily from the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003 and lower plant maintenance costs primarily due to the number and timing of outages ($60 million). There was not a refueling outage at the Callaway Nuclear Plant in 2003. See also Equity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A of this report for a discussion of our expectations and plans regarding trends in employee benefit costs. 49 Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $70 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs ($35 million) related to increasing healthcare costs and the investment performance of employee benefit plans assets, higher wages and higher plant maintenance expenses ($34 million). UE UEs other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $54 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to lower labor costs related to the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003 and lower plant maintenance costs ($34 million) as mentioned above, partially offset by the higher employee benefit costs ($10 million) and the net increase in injuries and damages reserves ($3 million) as mentioned above. UEs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $31 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs ($24 million), higher wages and higher plant maintenance expenses ($3 million). CIPS CIPS other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $5 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to lower labor costs related to the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003 as mentioned above, and a decrease in environmental costs ($3 million), partially offset by the net increase in injuries and damages costs ($8 million) as mentioned above. CIPS other operations and maintenance expenses increased $7 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs ($5 million), higher tree trimming costs ($2 million), increased routine repair costs ($2 million) and an increase in the environmental costs ($3 million), partially offset by the receipt of insurance reimbursements related to litigation settlements ($7 million). Genco Gencos other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $21 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a reduction in consulting costs at its coal fired generation stations, a decrease in commitment fees for the use of UEs and CIPS electric transmission lines ($5 million) and a net decrease in injuries and damages reserves ($3 million). Gencos other operations and maintenance expenses increased $17 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs ($4 million), higher wages, higher injuries and damages expenses based on claims experience ($4 million), incremental increases associated with the CTs added during 2001, costs for efficiency improvements made at the coal fired plants and timing of plant outages between years. CILCORP CILCORPs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $1 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs and bad debt expense, partially offset by reduced environmental costs for remediation of elevated boron levels at the Duck Creek power plant recycle pond in 2002 and favorable purchase accounting adjustments. CILCORPs other operations and maintenance expense increased $13 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to the accrual of environmental costs ($9 million) for remediation of elevated boron levels at the Duck Creek power plant recycle pond, higher employee benefit costs ($9 million), and power plant operations ($1 million). These increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense ($3 million). CILCO CILCOs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $19 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs ($19 million) and higher bad debt expense ($5 million), partially offset by reduced environmental costs ($9 million) for remediation of elevated boron levels at the Duck Creek power plant recycle pond in 2002. 50 CILCOs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $12 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to the accrual of environmental costs ($9 million) for remediation of elevated boron levels at the Duck Creek power plant recycle pond, higher employee benefit costs ($9 million), and power plant operations ($1 million). These increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense ($3 million). Voluntary Retirement and Other Restructuring Charges and Coal Contract Settlement See Note 7 Restructuring Charges and Other Special Items to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report. Depreciation and Amortization 2003 versus 2002 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $88 million and $6 million at Ameren and Genco, respectively, in 2003 as compared to 2002. The increase at Ameren was primarily due to the inclusion of CILCORP operations in 2003 (eleven months ended December 31, 2003 $72 million). In addition, depreciation and amortization expenses increased at Ameren and Genco due to new capital additions. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $3 million at UE in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to capital additions, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation rates. The decrease in depreciation rates of $5 million in 2003 was based on the updated analysis of asset values, service lives and accumulated depreciation levels that were required by UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $6 million at CILCORP in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to the effect of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the book value of the Duck Creek and E.D. Edwards power plants and Sterling Avenue peaking station ($7 million). The increase in book value is being depreciated over the estimated remaining lives of the generating facilities of 15 to 34 years. Depreciation and amortization expenses at CIPS and CILCO in 2003 were comparable to 2002. 2002 versus 2001 Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased $25 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to investment in CTs and coal fired power plants. The increase was partially offset by a reduction of depreciation rates ($15 million) based on an updated analysis of asset values, service lives and accumulated depreciation levels that were required by UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement. Gencos depreciation and amortization expense increased $16 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, due to Gencos investment in CTs and coal fired power plants. CILCORPs depreciation and amortization expense decreased $14 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in 2002. With the adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization. Goodwill amortization was $15 million in 2001. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information regarding our goodwill policy. Depreciation and amortization expenses at UE, CIPS and CILCO in 2002 were comparable to 2001. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At Ameren, taxes other than income taxes increased $37 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to the acquisition of CILCORP (eleven months ended December 31, 2003 $34 million). At UE, taxes other than income taxes decreased $5 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to a decrease in gross receipts taxes ($2 million) related to lower native sales resulting from milder weather and a decrease in real estate taxes related to lower assessments in 2003. At Genco, taxes other than income taxes increased $9 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to adjustments related to property tax assessments and increased property taxes associated with the four CTs added in the third and 51 fourth quarters of 2002. CIPS, CILCORPs and CILCOs taxes other than income taxes in 2003 were comparable to 2002. At Ameren, taxes other than income taxes in 2002 were comparable to 2001. At UE, taxes other than income taxes increased $4 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, due to higher gross receipts taxes ($3 million) resulting from increased residential and commercial electric sales and higher payroll taxes ($1 million) resulting from increased wages. At CIPS, taxes other than income taxes increased $4 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, due to revised property tax assessments in 2001. At Genco, taxes other than income taxes decreased $7 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, due to reduced property tax assessments, partially offset by increased property taxes in 2002 associated with the CTs added in 2001. Taxes other than income taxes at CILCORP and CILCO in 2002 were comparable to 2001. Other Income and Deductions 2003 versus 2002 Amerens and UEs other income and deductions increased in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to the expensing of economic development and energy assistance programs required by the UE Missouri electric rate case settlement in 2002 ($26 million). Amerens other income and deductions also increased in 2003 due to a decrease in the minority interest related to EEIs lower earnings in 2003. The increase in UEs other income and deductions was partially offset by a net decrease in earnings from UEs ownership interest in EEI and decreased gains on derivative contracts. CIPS other income and deductions decreased in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a decline in intercompany interest ($3 million) CIPS received on the Genco subordinated promissory note due to a lower outstanding principal balance. In addition, CIPS other income and deductions decreased in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to a decrease in contributions in aid of construction ($2 million). Gencos, CILCORPs and CILCOs other income and deductions in 2003 were comparable to 2002. 2002 versus 2001 Amerens other income and deductions decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease was primarily due to the cost of economic development and energy assistance programs required by the settlement of UEs Missouri electric rate case ($26 million) and an increase in the deduction for minority interest earnings principally related to EEIs sale of emission credits ($10 million). See Note 8 Other Income and Deductions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. UEs other income and deductions decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease was primarily due to the cost of economic development and energy assistance programs mentioned above, lower intercompany interest earned in 2002 on funds loaned to the utility money pool resulting from lower average intercompany notes receivable balances ($7 million), and decreased gains on energy trading contracts. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in earnings from UEs ownership interest in EEI primarily resulting from its sale of emission credits ($10 million). Gencos other income and deductions decreased in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to the absence of consulting fees received in 2001 ($3 million) and less interest income from advances to the money pool ($2 million). CILCORPs and CILCOs other income and deductions in 2002 were comparable to 2001. Interest 2003 versus 2002 Interest expense increased at Ameren in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to the assumption of CILCORP debt (eleven months ended December 31, 2003 $48 million). In addition, interest expense was higher in 2003 due to Gencos issuance of $275 million of 7.95% senior notes in June 2002 ($10 million). 52 Interest expense decreased at CIPS in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to the maturity or redemption of first mortgage bonds in the third quarter of 2002 ($2 million) and in the second quarter of 2003 ($5 million). Interest expense increased at Genco in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to increased borrowings from Amerens non state regulated subsidiary money pool ($9 million), partially offset by a reduction in the principal amounts outstanding on subordinated intercompany promissory notes to CIPS and Ameren in May 2003 ($4 million). In addition, Gencos interest expense increased in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to the issuance of $275 million of 7.95% senior notes in June 2002, as mentioned above. Interest expense decreased at CILCORP and CILCO in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to the redemption of long term debt, partially offset by expense associated with debt redemption. In addition, interest expense decreased due to the effect of purchase accounting adjustments made at CILCORP ($7 million) based on market rates. The increase in the book value of long term debt resulting from purchase accounting is being amortized as a reduction in interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. UEs interest expense in 2003 was comparable to 2002. 2002 versus 2001 Interest expense increased at Ameren in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to the interest expense component associated with the $345 million of adjustable conversion rate equity security units Ameren issued in March 2002 ($16 million) and Gencos issuance of $275 million of 7.95% senior notes in June 2002 ($12 million). Interest expense decreased at UE in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to lower interest rates on UEs variable rate environmental debt obligations and lower interest expense associated with a decreased balance under UEs nuclear fuel lease, partially offset by increased short term intercompany interest as a result of UEs borrowings from the utility money pool in 2002. Interest expense increased at CIPS in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to interest ($4 million) associated with the $150 million issuance of long term debt in 2001, partially offset by decreased short term intercompany interest as a result of less intercompany borrowings from the utility money pool in 2002. Interest expense increased at Genco in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to the issuance of $275 million of 7.95% senior notes in June 2002 ($12 million) and additional borrowings, prior to the issuance of the senior notes, from Amerens non state regulated subsidiary money pool at higher interest rates, compared to 2001. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in the principal amounts outstanding on subordinated intercompany promissory notes to CIPS and Ameren. Interest expense decreased at CILCORP and CILCO in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to decreased short term borrowings. Income Taxes Income tax expense increased at Ameren, UE and Genco in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to higher pre tax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate at Ameren. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to an Illinois tax settlement ($7 million) at CIPS in the third quarter of 2003. Income tax expense decreased at CIPS primarily due to lower pre tax income and a lower effective tax rate as mentioned above. Income tax expense decreased at CILCO primarily due to lower pre tax income. CILCORPs income tax expense in 2003 was comparable to 2002. See also Note 13 Income Taxes to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for information regarding effective tax rates. Income tax expense decreased at Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco and CILCORP in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to lower pre tax income. Income tax expense increased at CILCO in 2002, as compared to 2001, primarily due to higher pre tax income. 53 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The tariff based gross margins of Amerens rate regulated utility operating companies continue to be the principal source of cash from operating activities for Ameren and its rate regulated subsidiaries. A diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate regulated residential, commercial and industrial classes and a commodity mix of gas and electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows. In addition, we plan to utilize short term debt to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements. The following tables present net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001: Net Cash Provided By Net Cash Provided By Net Cash Provided By 2003 versus Operating (Used In) Investing (Used In) Financing 2002 Activities Activities Activities 2003 2002 Variance 2003 2002 Variance 2003 2002 Variance Ameren(a)....... $1,031 $ 833 $ 198 $ (1,181) $ (803) $ (378) $ (367) $ 531 $(898) UE.............. 639 696 (57) (503) (454) (49) (130) (248) 118 CIPS............ 56 96 (40) 12 (7) 19 (69) (98) 29 Genco........... 211 110 101 (58) (442) 384 (154) 333 (487) CILCORP(b)...... 70 88 (18) (95) (120) 25 4 46 (42) CILCO(c)........ 103 109 (6) (86) (123) 37 (31) 24 (55) (a) Excludes amounts for CILCORP and CILCO prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; includes amounts for non registrant Ameren subsidiaries as well as intercompany eliminations.

See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. Cash Flows from Operating Activities 2003 versus 2002 Cash flows provided by operating activities increased for Ameren and Genco and decreased for UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 as compared to 2002. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for Ameren and Genco was primarily a result of increased net earnings discussed above under Results of Operations. The increase at Ameren was reduced by two non cash components of net earnings, one associated with the gain of $18 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the other the $51 million pre tax gain related to UEs settlement of the coal mine reclamation issues, of which only $15 million was received in cash during 2003. 54 Partially offsetting these benefits to cash flows from operating activities were increased materials and supplies inventories resulting from increased natural gas volumes being put into storage, principally due to the acquisition of CILCORP, recorded at Ameren, and higher gas prices. Cash provided by operating activities decreased for UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to increased working capital requirements and timing differences. UEs decrease in cash flows from operating activities was attributable to increased tax payments and gas inventory increases, partially offset by lower operations and maintenance expenses and the $51 million pre tax gain related to UEs settlement of the coal mine reclamation issues, of which $15 million was received in cash during 2003. CIPS decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to increased tax payments in 2003 compared to 2002. 2002 versus 2001 Cash flows provided by operating activities increased for Ameren and UE and decreased for CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO for 2002 as compared to 2001. The increase in cash flows from operating activities for Ameren and UE was primarily due to higher cash earnings resulting from favorable weather conditions. In addition, Amerens cash flows from operations benefited from sales of emission credits. The increase at Ameren and UE was partially offset by payments of customer sharing credits under UEs now expired Missouri electric alternative regulation plan ($40 million) and the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued taxes. Also offseting Amerens increase in cash flows from operations were discretionary pension plan contributions of $31 million in 2002. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities for CIPS and Genco was primarily attributable to the timing of payments on accounts payable and changes in working capital. CIPS decrease in cash flows from operations was also caused by lower contributions in aid of construction and increased pension funding costs. The timing of payment of funds between Genco and its affiliates contributed to Gencos decrease in cash flows. CILCORPs and CILCOs decreases in cash flows from operations were primarily due to changes in working capital requirements offset by increased non rate regulated sales to electric customers in Illinois outside CILCOs service territory. Pension Funding Ameren made cash contributions totaling $25 million in 2003 and $31 million in 2002 to our defined benefit retirement plan qualified trusts. A minimum pension liability was recorded at December 31, 2002, which resulted in an after tax charge to OCI and a reduction in stockholders equity for Ameren of $102 million. At December 31, 2003, the minimum pension liability was reduced, resulting in OCI of $46 million and an increase in stockholders equity. The following table presents the minimum pension liability amounts, after taxes, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 Ameren(a)...................................... $ 56 $ 102 UE............................................. 34 62 CIPS........................................... 7 13 Genco.......................................... 4 6 CILCORP(b)..................................... 60 CILCO.......................................... 13 30 (a) Excludes amounts for CILCORP and CILCO prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; includes amounts for non registrant Ameren subsidiaries. (b) 2002 amounts represent predecessor information. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. As discussed above, we made cash contributions in 2003 and 2002 to our defined benefit retirement plan qualified trusts. Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2003, we expect to be required under ERISA to fund an average of approximately $115 million annually from 2005 through 2008 in order to maintain minimum funding levels for our pension plans. We expect UEs, CIPS, Gencos and CILCOs portion of the 2005 to 2008 funding requirements to be approximately 65%, 10%, 10% and 15%, respectively. These amounts are estimates and may change based on actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in government regulations and any prior voluntary contributions. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information. 55 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2003 versus 2002 Cash flows used in investing activities increased for Ameren and UE and decreased for CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 as compared to 2002. Amerens increase in cash used in investing activities in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily related to $479 million in cash paid for the acquisitions of CILCORP and Medina Valley in early 2003 and capital expenditures for CILCORP in 2003. These increased investing activities in 2003 were partially offset by lower construction expenditures at the other Ameren subsidiaries and lower nuclear fuel expenditures in 2003. The increase for UE over the prior year period was primarily related to the 2002 receipt of $84 million UE had invested in the utility money pool, partially offset by lower construction and nuclear fuel expenditures in 2003. The decrease in cash flows used in investing activities from the prior year period for Genco was primarily related to lower construction expenditures as Genco completed construction of CTs in 2002. In addition, Genco paid approximately $140 million in the first quarter of 2002 to Development Company for a CT purchased, but not yet paid for, at December 31, 2001. The decrease for CILCORP and CILCO was primarily due to lower construction expenditures related to the completed installation of pollution control equipment at its coal fired power plants. The increase in cash provided by investing activities for CIPS was primarily due to principal payments received on its intercompany note receivable from Genco. 2002 versus 2001 Cash flows used in investing activities decreased for Ameren and increased for UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO for 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease in cash from investing activities at Ameren was primarily due to lower construction expenditures in 2002. The increase in cash used in investing activities at UE in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to the decrease in the intercompany notes receivables related to the utility money pool arrangements offset by a decrease in construction expenditures. CIPS cash used in investing activities increased due to higher construction expenditures in 2002 compared to 2001 and also due to the decrease in the intercompany note receivable with Genco. Gencos cash used in investing activities increased due to an increase in construction expenditures and to the 2001 receipt of $100 million Genco had invested in the non state regulated subsidiary money pool. Cash used in investing activities increased for both CILCORP and CILCO primarily due to an increase in construction expenditures in 2002 as compared to 2001. Construction Expenditures The following table presents the capital expenditures by the Ameren Companies for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001: Capital Expenditures 2003 2002 2001 Ameren(a)......................................... $ 682 $ 787 $ 1,102 UE................................................ 480 520 587 CIPS.............................................. 50 57 50 Genco............................................. 58 442 347 CILCORP(b)........................................ 87 124 51 CILCO............................................. 87 124 51 Other(c).......................................... 23 (232) 118 (a) Excludes amounts for CILCORP and CILCO prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; includes amounts for non registrant Ameren subsidiaries as well as intercompany eliminations. (b) 2002 and 2001 amounts represent predecessor information. 2003 amounts include January 2003 predecessor information of $16 million. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (c) Consists primarily of capital expenditures by Ameren Services and includes intercompany transactions between Development Company and Genco related to Gencos purchase of a CT in 2002. Amerens construction expenditures for 2003 principally related to various upgrades at UEs and Gencos coal fired power plants, NOx reduction equipment expenditures at CILCOs generating plants, replacements and improvements to the existing electric transmission and distribution and natural gas distribution systems, and construction costs for CTs at UE. In 2002, UE placed into service 240 megawatts of CT capacity (approximately $135 million). In addition, Genco placed into service 470 megawatts of CT capacity (approximately $215 million). Also in 2002, Genco paid approximately $140 million to Development Company for a CT purchased but accrued for in December 2001. In addition, selective catalytic reduction technology was added on two units at one of Gencos coal fired power plants at a 56 cost of approximately $42 million. In 2001, Genco added approximately 850 megawatts of CT capacity at a total cost of approximately $530 million. The following table presents the construction expenditures estimated to be incurred by the Ameren Companies over the next five years through 2008, including capitalized interest and allowance for funds used during construction (except for Genco which has no allowance for funds used during construction): Estimated Construction Expenditures 2004 2005 2008 Total UE................................................... $ 510 $ 1,800 $ 2,000 $ 2,310 $ 2,510 CIPS................................................. 40 120 300 160 340 Genco................................................ 50 100 200 150 250 CILCORP (parent only)................................

(b) Includes amounts for non registrant Ameren subsidiaries. UEs estimate includes capital expenditures for the replacement of steam generators at UEs Callaway Nuclear Plant and for transmission, distribution and other generation related activities, as well as for compliance with new NOx control regulations, as discussed below. Also included in the estimate is the addition of new CTs at UE with approximately 330 megawatts of capacity at UEs Venice, Illinois location by the end of 2005. Total costs expected to be incurred for these units approximate $140 million, of which approximately $77 million was committed as of December 31, 2003. UE committed to make between $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion of infrastructure investments during the period of January 1, 2002 to June 30, 2006, as part of UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement. In addition, commitments totaling at least $15 million for gas infrastructure improvements between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2006 were agreed upon in relation to UEs 2003 Missouri gas rate case settlement. Both federal and state laws require significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions that result from burning fossil fuels. The Clean Air Act creates a marketable commodity called an SO2 "allowance." Each allowance gives the owner the right to emit one ton of SO2. All existing generating facilities have been allocated allowances based on past production and the statutory emission reduction goals. If additional allowances are needed for new generating facilities, they can be purchased from facilities having excess allowances or from SO2 allowance banks. Our generating facilities comply with the SO2 allowance caps through the purchase of allowances, the use of low sulfur fuels or through the application of pollution control technology. The EPA issued a rule in October 1998 requiring 22 eastern states and the District of Columbia to reduce emissions of NOx in order to reduce ozone in the eastern United States. Among other things, the EPAs rule establishes an ozone season, which runs from May through September, and a NOx emission budget for each state, including Illinois. The EPA rule requires states to implement controls sufficient to meet their NOx budget by May 31, 2004. In February 2002, the EPA proposed similar rules for Missouri. These are expected to be issued as final rules in the spring of 2004. The compliance date for the Missouri rules is expected to be May 1, 2007. As a result of these requirements, Ameren generating companies have installed a variety of NOx control technologies on their power plant boilers over the past several years. The following table presents estimated remaining capital expenditures to comply with the final NOx regulations in Missouri and Illinois between 2004 and 2008: Ameren................................... $210 million to $250 million UE....................................... $160 million to $180 million CIPS..................................... Genco.................................... $ 50 million to $ 70 million CILCORP.................................. CILCO.................................... 57 These estimates include the assumption that the regulations will require the installation of selective catalytic reduction technology on some of our units, as well as additional controls. In 2004, we are seeking regulatory approval to transfer at net book value approximately 550 megawatts (approximately $250 million) of generating capacity from Genco to UE, to satisfy the requirements of UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement and to meet future UE generating capacity needs. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. This transfer is not included in our estimated capital expenditures listed in the table above. CIPS and CILCOs estimates include capital expenditures for transmission and distribution related activities. Gencos estimate includes capital expenditures for upgrades to existing coal and gas fired facilities and other generation related activities. CILCOs estimate also includes capital expenditures for generation related activities, as well as for compliance with new NOx control regulations at AERGs generating facilities. We continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs and, as a result, we could modify our plan for generation capacity, which could include the timing of when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, or whether capacity may be purchased, among other things. Any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material. Potential Future Environmental Capital Expenditure Requirements The following environmental matters are currently pending, but have not been included in our estimated capital expenditures for the period of 2004 to 2008. New Source Review On December 31, 2002, the EPA published in the Federal Register revisions to the NSR programs under the Clean Air Act, governing pollution control requirements for new fossil fueled generating plants and major modifications to existing plants. On October 27, 2003, the EPA published a set of associated rules governing the routine maintenance, repair and replacement of equipment at power plants. Various northeastern states, the State of Illinois and others, have filed a petition with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the legality of the revisions to these NSR programs. Other states, various industries and environmental groups have filed to intervene in this challenge. At this time, we are unable to predict the impact if this challenge is successful on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Interstate Air Quality and Mercury Rules In mid December 2003, the EPA issued proposed regulations with respect to SO2 and NOx emissions (the "Interstate Air Quality Rule") and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants. These new rules, if adopted, will require significant additional reductions in these emissions from our power plants in phases, beginning in 2010. The rules are currently under a public review and comment period, and may change before being issued in 2004 or 2005. The following table presents preliminary estimates of capital costs based on current technology on the Ameren systems to comply with the SO2 and NOx rules, as proposed. 2010 2015 Ameren...................................... $400 million to $600 million $500 million to $800 million UE.......................................... $250 million to $350 million $300 million to $500 million CIPS........................................ Genco....................................... $140 million to $220 million $150 million to $200 million CILCORP(a).................................. $10 million to $30 million $50 million to $100 million CILCO....................................... $10 million to $30 million $50 million to $100 million (a) CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. 58 The proposed mercury regulations contain a number of options and the final control requirements are highly uncertain. Ameren estimates additional capital costs to comply with the mercury rules to be up to $100 million by 2010, with UE incurring approximately two thirds of the costs and Genco incurring most of the remaining costs. Depending upon the final mercury rules, similar additional costs would be incurred between 2010 and 2018. Multi Pollutant Legislation The United States Congress has been working on legislation to consolidate the numerous air pollution regulations facing the utility industry. Continued deliberation on this "multi pollutant" legislation is expected in 2004. The cost to comply with such legislation, if enacted, is expected to be covered by the modifications to our facilities required by combined Interstate Air Quality and Mercury Rules described above. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of environmental matters. Cash Flows from Financing Activities 2003 versus 2002 Cash flows from financing activities decreased for Ameren, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO and increased for UE and CIPS in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease in cash flows from financing activities for Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO was primarily due to an increase in redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt. The decrease in cash flows from financing activities for Ameren was also due to the payment on the nuclear fuel lease related to UE and the incremental payment of dividends on common stock by Ameren due to increased shares outstanding. In addition, Ameren had decreased proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and common stock, which totaled $1.1 billion in 2003 compared to $1.6 billion in 2002. Proceeds from the sale of common shares by Ameren in 2003 and 2002 were primarily used to fund the acquisition of CILCORP, which was completed in January 2003. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail. Gencos decrease in cash flows from financing activities resulted from decreased borrowings from the non state regulated subsidiary money pool, as well as no issuances of long term debt in 2003. The decreases in cash flows from financing activities at CILCORP and CILCO were partially offset by proceeds received from intercompany borrowing arrangements by CILCORP and CILCO in 2003. Cash flows from financing activities increased at UE in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to additional proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt offset by increased redemptions of debt in 2003 compared to 2002. Cash flows used in financing activities decreased at CIPS in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to increased proceeds from borrowings from the utility money pool, offset by increased long term debt payments. 2002 versus 2001 Cash flows from financing activities increased for Ameren, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO and decreased for UE for 2002 compared to 2001. Amerens increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily due to the increase in proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt and sale of common shares offset by an increase in redemptions of short term and long term debt and an increase in dividends paid on common stock. Cash flows used in financing activities at CIPS decreased primarily due to decreased borrowings from the utility money pool, partially offset by decreased long term debt issuances. Gencos cash provided by financing activities increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to the issuance of long term debt and increased borrowings under the non state regulated subsidiary money pool arrangement, partially offset by dividends paid to Ameren in 2002 and a cash contribution received by Ameren in 2001. Cash flows from financing activities at CILCORP and CILCO increased from 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the issuance of long term debt. Cash flows used in financing activities increased for UE due to increased redemptions of long term debt and reductions in short term borrowings as well as dividend payments on common stock, partially offset by the issuance of long term debt. Ameren and UE are authorized by the SEC under PUHCA to have up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion and $1 billion, respectively, of short term unsecured debt instruments outstanding at any time. In addition, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO have PUHCA authority to have up to an aggregate of $250 million each of short term unsecured debt 59 instruments outstanding at any time. Genco is authorized by the FERC to have up to $300 million of short term debt outstanding at any time. Short term Borrowings and Liquidity Short term borrowings consist of commercial paper and bank loans (maturities generally within 1 to 45 days). Short term borrowings at Ameren and UE at December 31, 2003, were $161 million (2002 $271 million) and $150 million (2002 $250 million, respectively. CILCO had short term borrowings of $10 million at December 31, 2002, with no amount outstanding at December 31, 2003. The average short term borrowings at UE were $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.1%(2002 $65 million with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%) Peak short term borrowings for UE were $228 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.2% (2002 $173 million with a weighted average interest rate of 1.7%) CILCOs commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2002, had a weighted average interest rate of 2.05%.

(b) Provided for financing of nuclear fuel. The agreement was terminated in February 2004. At December 31, 2003, certain of the Ameren Companies had committed bank credit facilities totaling $829 million, excluding the EEI facilities and the nuclear fuel lease facility, which were available for use by UE, CIPS, CILCO and Ameren Services through a utility money pool arrangement (2002 $695 million). As of December 31, 2003, $679 million was available under these committed credit facilities, excluding the EEI facilities and the nuclear fuel lease facility. In addition, $600 million of the $829 million may be used by Ameren directly and most of the non rate regulated affiliates including, but not limited to, Resources Company, Genco, Marketing Company, AFS, AERG and Ameren Energy through a non state regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. CILCO received final regulatory approval to participate in the utility money pool arrangement in September 2003. CILCORP received funds through direct loans from Ameren since it was not part of the non state regulated money pool agreement. The committed bank credit facilities are used to support our commercial paper programs under which $150 million was outstanding at December 31, 2003 (2002 $250 million). Access to credit facilities for all Ameren Companies is subject to reduction based on use by affiliates. AERG received final regulatory approval to participate in the non state regulated subsidiary money pool arrangement and as a lender only in the utility money pool arrangement in October 2003. See Note 14 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements. In July 2003, Ameren entered into two new revolving credit facilities totaling $470 million, and in April 2003, UE entered into a new 364 day committed credit facility totaling $75 million. See Note 5 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a detailed explanation of these credit facilities. EEI also has two bank credit agreements totaling $45 million that extend through June 2004. At December 31, 2003, $37 million was available under these committed credit facilities. 60 UE also had a lease agreement that provided for the financing of nuclear fuel. At December 31, 2003, $67 million was financed under the lease (2002 $113 million). The lease agreement was terminated in February 2004. See Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. The following table summarizes the amount of commitment expiration per period as of December 31, 2003: Total Less than 1 3 4 5 More than Committed 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Ameren......................... $ 600 $ 235 $ 365 $ $ UE(a).......................... 274 274 CIPS........................... 15 15 CILCO.......................... 60 60 EEI............................ 45 45 Total ......................... $ 994 $ 629 $ 365 $ $ (a) Includes $120 million which supported the nuclear fuel lease. This lease was terminated in February 2004. In addition to committed credit facilities, a further source of liquidity for Ameren is available cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2003, Ameren had $111 million of cash and cash equivalents (2002 $628 million). Ameren and its subsidiaries rely on access to short term and long term capital markets as a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows. The inability by us to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively impact our ability to maintain and grow our businesses. Based on our current credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets such that our cost of capital would increase or our ability to access the capital markets would be adversely affected. Long term Debt and Equity The following table presents the issuances of common stock and the issuances, redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt and preferred stock for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001 for the Ameren Companies. For additional information related to the terms and uses of these issuances and the sources of funds and terms for the redemptions, see Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

(c) 2002 and 2001 amounts for CILCORP are predecessor information and have been included in the total long term debt and preferred stock redemption and repurchases. Ameren Pursuant to an August 2002 shelf registration statement, Ameren issued approximately $338 million of common stock in 2002 and issued approximately $256 million of common stock in 2003. Net proceeds from the issuances were used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for its acquisition of CILCORP and for general corporate purposes. In February 2004, Ameren issued, pursuant to the August 2002 shelf registration statement, 19.1 million shares of its common stock at $45.90 per share. Ameren received net proceeds of $853 million, which are expected to provide funds required to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of Illinois Power and Dynegys 20% interest in EEI and to reduce Illinois Power debt assumed as part of this transaction and pay related premiums. Pending such use, and or if the acquisition is not completed, Ameren plans to use the net proceeds to reduce present or future indebtedness and or repurchase securities of Ameren or its subsidiaries. A portion of the net proceeds may also be temporarily invested in short term instruments. As substantially all of the capacity under the August 2002 shelf registration was used, Ameren expects to make a new shelf registration statement filing with the SEC in early 2004. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. The acquisitions of CILCORP on January 31, 2003, and Medina Valley on February 4, 2003, included the assumption by Ameren of CILCORP and Medina Valley debt and preferred stock at closing of $895 million. The assumed debt and preferred stock consisted of $250 million 9.375% senior notes due 2029, $225 million 8.70% senior notes due 2009, a $100 million secured floating rate term loan due 2004, other secured indebtedness totaling $279 million and preferred stock of $41 million. UE In August 2002, a shelf registration statement filed by UE and its subsidiary trust with the SEC was declared effective. This registration statement permitted the offering from time to time of up to $750 million of various forms of long term debt and trust preferred securities to refinance existing debt and preferred stock, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of short term debt incurred to finance construction expenditures and other working capital needs. UE issued securities totaling $173 million in 2002 and $498 million in 2003 pursuant to the August 2002 shelf registration statement with the amount of securities that remained available for issuance totaling $79 million as of August 2003. See Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. In September 2003, the SEC declared effective another shelf registration statement filed by UE and its subsidiary trust in August 2003, covering the offering from time to time of up to $1 billion of various forms of long term debt and 63 trust preferred securities. The $79 million of securities which remained available for issuance under the August 2002 shelf registration statement is included in the $1 billion of securities available to be issued under this shelf registration statement. UE issued securities totaling $200 million in 2003 pursuant to the September 2003 shelf registration statement with the amount of securities remaining available for issuance at December 31, 2003, totaling $800 million. UE may sell all, or a portion of, the currently remaining securities registered under the September 2003 shelf registration statement if warranted by market conditions and capital requirements. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder. CIPS In May 2001, a shelf registration statement filed by CIPS with the SEC was declared effective. This registration statement enables CIPS to offer from time to time senior notes in one or more series with an offering price not to exceed $250 million. In June 2001, CIPS issued, under the shelf registration statement, $150 million of senior notes. At December 31, 2003, the amount of securities remaining available for issuance pursuant to the shelf registration statement was $100 million. CIPS may sell all, or a portion of, the currently remaining securities registered under the May 2001 shelf registration statement if warranted by market conditions and capital requirements. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants Bank Credit Facilities Borrowings under Amerens non state regulated subsidiary money pool by Genco, Development Company and Medina Valley, each an "exempt wholesale generator," are considered investments for purposes of the 50% SEC aggregate investment limitation. Based on Amerens aggregate investment in these "exempt wholesale generators" as of December 31, 2003, the maximum permissible borrowings under Amerens non state regulated subsidiary money pool pursuant to this limitation for these entities was $663 million in the aggregate. Certain of the Ameren Companies bank credit agreements contain provisions which, among other things, place restrictions on the ability to incur liens, sell assets, merge with other entities and restrict and encumber upstream dividend payments of our subsidiaries. These credit agreements also contain a provision that limits Amerens, UEs, CIPS and CILCOs total indebtedness to 60% of total capitalization pursuant to a calculation defined in the related agreement. As of December 31, 2003, the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization (calculated in accordance with this provision) for Ameren, UE, CIPS and CILCO was 52%, 44%, 54% and 53%, respectively (2002 50%, 43%, 50%, %). These credit agreement provisions were not applicable in 2002 for CILCO, since CILCO was not a party to, nor subject to the provisions of, these facilities during 2002. In addition, the credit agreements contain indebtedness cross default provisions and material adverse change clauses, which could trigger a default under these facilities in the event that any of Amerens subsidiaries (subject to the definition in the underlying credit agreements), other than certain project finance subsidiaries, defaults on indebtedness in excess of $50 million. The credit agreements also require us to meet minimum ERISA funding rules. None of the Ameren Companies credit agreements or financing arrangements contain credit rating triggers with the exception of one of CILCOs financing arrangements. An event of default will occur under a $100 million CILCO bank term loan if the credit rating on CILCOs first mortgage bonds falls below any two of the following: BBB from S&P, Baa3 from Moodys or BBB from Fitch. As of December 31, 2003, CILCOs current ratings on its first mortgage bonds were A , A2 and A, respectively. This term loan was repaid in February 2004. At December 31, 2003, Ameren and its subsidiaries were in compliance with their credit agreement provisions and covenants. Indenture Provisions and Other Covenants UE UEs indenture agreements and Articles of Incorporation include covenants and provisions which must be complied with in order to issue first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. UE must comply with earnings tests contained in its respective mortgage indenture and Articles of Incorporation. For the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds, 64 earnings coverage of twice the annual interest charges on first mortgage bonds outstanding and to be issued is required. At December 31, 2003, UE had a coverage ratio of 9.1 times the annual interest charges on the first mortgage bonds outstanding, which would permit UE to issue an additional $4.2 billion of first mortgage bonds. For the issuance of additional preferred stock, earnings coverage of at least 2.5 times the annual dividend on preferred stock outstanding and to be issued is required under UEs Articles of Incorporation. As of December 31, 2003, UE had a coverage ratio of 74.2 times the annual dividend on preferred stock outstanding which would permit UE to issue an additional $2.4 billion in preferred stock. The ability to issue such securities in the future will depend on such tests at that time. In addition, UEs mortgage indenture contains certain provisions which restrict the amount of common dividends that can be paid by UE. Under this mortgage indenture, $31 million of total retained earnings was restricted against payment of common dividends, except those payable in common stock, leaving $1.6 billion of free and unrestricted retained earnings at December 31, 2003. CIPS CIPS indenture agreements and Articles of Incorporation include covenants which must be complied with in order to issue first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. CIPS must comply with earnings tests contained in its respective mortgage indenture and Articles of Incorporation. For the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds, earnings coverage of twice the annual interest charges on first mortgage bonds outstanding and to be issued is required. As of December 31, 2003, CIPS had a coverage ratio of 2.5 times the annual interest charges for one year on the aggregate amount of bonds outstanding, and consequently, had the availability to issue an additional $66 million of first mortgage bonds. For the issuance of additional preferred stock, earnings coverage of 1.5 times annual interest charges on all long term debt and preferred stock dividends is required under CIPS Articles of Incorporation. As of December 31, 2003, CIPS had a coverage ratio of 1.8 times the sum of the annual interest charges and dividend requirements on all long term debt and preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2003, and consequently, had the availability to issue an additional $109 million of preferred stock. The ability to issue such securities in the future will depend on coverage ratios at that time. Genco Gencos senior note indenture includes provisions that require it to maintain a senior debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.8 to 1 (for both the prior four fiscal quarters and for the next succeeding four six month periods) in order to pay dividends to Ameren or to make payments of principal or interest under certain subordinated indebtedness excluding amounts payable under its intercompany note payable with CIPS. For the four quarters ended December 31, 2003, this ratio was 3.8 to 1. In addition, the indenture also restricts Genco from incurring any additional indebtedness, with the exception of certain permitted indebtedness as defined in the indenture, unless its senior debt service coverage ratio equals at least 2.5 to 1 for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters and its senior debt to total capital ratio would not exceed 60%, both after giving effect to the additional indebtedness on a pro forma basis. This debt incurrence requirement is disregarded in the event certain rating agencies reaffirm the ratings of Genco after considering the additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2003, Gencos senior debt to total capital was 53%. CILCORP Covenants in CILCORPs indenture governing its $475 million (original issuance amount) senior notes and bonds require CILCORP to maintain a debt to capital ratio of no greater than 0.67 to 1 and an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.2 to 1 in order to make any payment of dividends or intercompany loans to affiliates other than to its direct and indirect subsidiaries including CILCO. However, in the event CILCORP is not in compliance with these tests, CILCORP may make such payments of dividends or intercompany loans if its senior long term debt rating is at least BB+ from S&P, Baa2 from Moodys and BBB from Fitch. At December 31, 2003, CILCORPs debt to capital ratio was 0.6 to 1 and its interest coverage ratio was 3.0 to 1, calculated in accordance with related provisions in this indenture. The common stock of CILCO is pledged as security to the holders of these senior notes and bonds. CILCO CILCO must maintain investment grade ratings for its first mortgage bonds from at least two of S&P, Moodys and Fitch. CILCOs current senior secured debt ratings from these rating agencies is A , A2 and A, respectively. CILCO had restrictions on the payment of dividends and its ability to otherwise make distributions with respect to its common stock as a result of its $100 million bank term loan. This loan was repaid in February 2004. 65 Dividends Common stock dividends paid by Ameren in 2003 resulted in a payout rate of 78% of Amerens net income. The payout rate in 2002 was 98% and was 75% in 2001. Dividends paid to common stockholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the same periods were 40%, 45% and 47%. The amount and timing of dividends payable on Amerens common stock are within the sole discretion of Amerens Board of Directors. Amerens Board of Directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends. However, the Board considers various issues including Amerens historic earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, cash flow and potential cash flow requirements, dividend payout rates at other utilities, return on investments with similar risk characteristics, and overall business considerations. Dividends paid by Ameren to stockholders totaled $410 million or $2.54 per share in 2003 (2002 $376 million or $2.54 per share, 2001 $350 million or $2.54 per share). On February 13, 2004, Amerens Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 63.5 cents per share payable on March 31, 2004, to stockholders of record on March 10, 2004. Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, provide restrictions on the Ameren Companies payment of dividends. Ameren would experience restrictions on dividend payments if it were to defer contract adjustment payments on its equity security units. UE would experience restrictions on dividend payments if it were to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures. CIPS has provisions restricting dividend payments based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization along with provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Gencos indenture includes restrictions which prohibit making any dividend payments if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold. CILCORP has restrictions in the event leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met or if CILCORPs senior long term debt does not have specified ratings as described in its indenture. CILCO has restrictions on dividend payments relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock and amounts to be set aside for any sinking fund retirement of 5.85% Series Preferred Stock. The following table presents dividends paid directly or indirectly to Ameren by its subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001: 2003 2002 2001 UE....................................................... $ 288 $ 299 $ 283 CIPS..................................................... 62 62 33 Genco.................................................... 36 21 CILCORP (parent company only)(a).........................

Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for information regarding Amerens and UEs capital expenditure commitments, which were agreed upon in relation to UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement and UEs 2003 Missouri gas rate case settlement. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for information regarding expected minimum funding levels for our pension plan.

Amounts for more than 5 years are not included in the total amount due to the indefinite periods. (b) Represents purchase contracts for coal, gas, nuclear fuel and electric capacity. (c) Routine short term purchase order commitments are not included. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2003, neither Ameren nor any of its subsidiaries, had any off balance sheet financing arrangements, other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. Neither Ameren nor any of its subsidiaries expects to engage in any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future. Credit Ratings The following table presents the current ratings by Moodys, S&P and Fitch as of December 31, 2003: Moodys S&P Fitch Ameren: Issuer/Corporate credit rating......... A3 A A Unsecured debt......................... A3 BBB+ A Commercial paper....................... P 2 A 2 F2 67 Moodys S&P Fitch UE: Secured debt........................... A1 A A+ Unsecured debt......................... A2 BBB+ A Commercial paper....................... P 1 A 2 F1 CIPS: Secured debt........................... A1 A A Unsecured debt......................... A2 BBB+ A Genco: Unsecured debt......................... A3/Baa2 A BBB+ CILCORP: Unsecured debt......................... Baa2 BBB+ BBB+ CILCO: Secured debt........................... A2 A A As a result of the announcement of Ameren signing a definitive agreement to acquire Illinois Power and a 20% interest in EEI from Dynegy in February 2004, credit rating agencies placed Ameren Corporations and its subsidiaries debt under review for a possible downgrade. Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies credit ratings may reduce their access to capital and or increase the costs of borrowings resulting in a negative impact on earnings. At December 31, 2003, if the Ameren Companies were to receive a sub investment grade rating (less than BBB or Baa3), UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO could have been required to post collateral for certain trade obligations amounting to $6 million, $1 million, $2 million, $18 million and $18 million, respectively. In addition, the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities would increase or decrease based on credit ratings. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. OUTLOOK We expect the following industry wide trends and company specific issues to impact earnings in 2004 and beyond: o Economic conditions, which principally impact native load demand, particularly from our industrial customers, have been weak for the past few years, but improved in 2003. o Ameren, UE and CIPS have historically achieved weather adjusted growth in their native electric residential and commercial load of approximately 2% per year and expect this trend to continue for at least the next few years. o Electric rates in UEs, CIPS and CILCOs Illinois service territories are legislatively fixed through January 1, 2007. An electric rate case settlement in UEs Missouri service territory has resulted in reductions of $50 million on April 1, 2002, and $30 million on April 1, 2003, with an additional $30 million reduction required for April 1, 2004. In addition, electric rates in Missouri cannot change prior to July 1, 2006, subject to certain exclusions outlined in UEs rate settlement. o Power prices in the Midwest impact the amount of revenues UE, Genco and AERG can generate by marketing any excess power into the interchange markets. Power prices in the Midwest also impact the cost of power we purchase in the interchange markets. Long term power prices continue to be generally soft in the Midwest, despite a significant increase in power prices in 2003 relative to 2002 due in part to higher prices for natural gas. o Increased expenses associated with rising employee benefit costs and higher insurance and security costs associated with additional measures UE has taken, or may have to take, at its Callaway Nuclear Plant and other operating plants related to world events. o UEs Callaway Nuclear Plant will have a refueling outage in the spring of 2004, which is expected to last 40 45 days, and will increase maintenance and purchased power costs, and reduce the amount of excess power available for sale. Refueling outages occur approximately every 18 months and have historically reduced net earnings at Ameren and UE by $15 to $20 million in the year when they occurred. UEs fall 2005 refueling outage is expected to last 70 days due to the installation of new steam generator units during the refueling. o In January 2004, the MoPSC approved a settlement authorizing an annual gas delivery rate increase of approximately $13 million, which went into effect on February 15, 2004. The settlement provides that gas delivery rates cannot change prior to July 1, 2006, subject to certain exclusions. In October 2003, the ICC issued orders awarding CILCO an increase in annual gas delivery rates of $9 million and awarding CIPS and UE increases in 68 annual gas delivery rates of $7 million and $2 million, respectively that went into effect in November 2003. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information. o Upon entering the Midwest ISO, UE expects to receive a refund of $13 million and CIPS expects to receive a refund of $5 million for fees previously paid to exit the Midwest ISO; however, Ameren, UE and CIPS will incur higher ongoing operation costs. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information. o Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO expect to realize further CILCORP integration synergies associated with reduced overhead expenses and lower fuel costs. o In February 2004, we sold 19.1 million shares of new Ameren common stock. Proceeds from this sale and future offerings are expected to ultimately be used to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of Illinois Power and to reduce Illinois Power debt assumed as part of this transaction and pay any related premiums. However, prior to the closing of the acquisition of Illinois Power, we expect the new common shares to be dilutive to earnings per share. In the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. These strategies may include potential acquisitions, divestitures, and opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives in order to increase Amerens shareholder value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed, as well as the impact these initiatives may have on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity, however the impact could be material. REGULATORY MATTERS See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report. ACCOUNTING MATTERS Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. Our application of these policies involves judgments regarding many factors, which, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures. In the table below, we have outlined the critical accounting policies that we believe are most difficult, subjective or complex. A future change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results. Accounting Policy Uncertainties Affecting Application Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery All the Ameren Companies, except Genco, o Regulatory environment, external regulatory decisions defer costs as regulatory assets and requirements in accordance with SFAS No. 71, o Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact "Accounting for the Effects of Certain o Impact of deregulation and competition on ratemaking Types of Regulation," and make process and ability to recover costs investments that it is assumed will be collected in future rates. Basis for Judgment We determine that costs are recoverable based on previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. 69 Accounting Policy Uncertainties Affecting Application Environmental Costs We accrue for all known environmental o Extent of contamination contamination where remediation can be o Responsible party determination reasonably estimated, but some of our o Approved methods for cleanup operations have existed for over 100 years o Present and future legislation and governmental and previous contamination may be regulations and standards unknown to us. o Results of ongoing research and development regarding environmental impacts Basis for Judgment We determine the proper amounts to accrue for known environmental contamination based on internal and third party estimates of clean up costs in the context of current remediation standards and available technology. Unbilled Revenue At the end of each period, we estimate, o Projecting customer energy usage based on expected usage, the amount of o Estimating impacts of weather and other usage affecting revenue to record for services that have factors for the unbilled period been provided to customers, but not billed. Basis for Judgment We determine the proper amount of unbilled revenue to accrue each period based on the volume of energy delivered as valued by a model of billing cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class for our service area, as adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and weather variations based on historical results. Valuation of Goodwill, Long Lived Assets and Asset Retirement Obligations We assess the carrying value of our o Managements identification of impairment indicators goodwill and long lived assets to determine o Changes in business, industry, technology or economic whether they are impaired. We also review and market conditions for the existence of asset retirement o Valuation assumptions and conclusions obligations. If an asset retirement o Estimated useful lives of our significant long lived obligation is identified, we determine the assets fair value of the obligation and o Actions or assessments by our regulators subsequently reassess and adjust the o Identification of an asset retirement obligation obligation, as necessary. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Basis for Judgment Annually or whenever events indicate a valuation may have changed, we utilize internal models and third parties to determine fair values. We use various methods to determine valuations, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples and discounted, undiscounted and probabilistic discounted cash flow models with multiple scenarios. The identification of asset retirement obligations is conducted through the review of legal documents and interviews. 70 Accounting Policy Uncertainties Affecting Application Benefit Plan Accounting Based on actuarial calculations, we accrue o Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets costs of providing future employee benefits o Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations in accordance with SFAS Nos. 87, 106 and o Healthcare cost trend rates 112, which provide guidance on benefit o Timing of employee retirements plan accounting. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report. Basis for Judgment We utilize a third party consultant to assist us in evaluating and recording the proper amount for future employee benefits. Our ultimate selection of the discount rate, healthcare trend rate and expected rate of return on pension assets is based on our review of available current, historical and projected rates, as applicable. Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report. EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Non retail electric rates are regulated by the FERC. Our Missouri electric and gas rates have been set through June 30, 2006, as part of the settlement of our Missouri electric and gas rate cases and our Illinois electric rates are legislatively fixed through January 1, 2007. Inflation affects our operations, earnings, stockholders equity and financial performance. The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers. As a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace plant in future years. Amerens generation portion of its business in its Illinois jurisdiction is principally non rate regulated and therefore does not have regulated recovery mechanisms. In our retail electric utility jurisdictions, there are no provisions for adjusting rates to accommodate for changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation. In our retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. We are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent we must purchase natural gas to run our CTs. We have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins to minimize the impact to the financial statements. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Commodity Price Risk for further information. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument, derivative or non derivative, caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates. The following discussion of our risk management activities includes "forward looking" statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the "forward looking" statements. We handle market risks in accordance with established policies, which may include entering into various derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable. Such risks principally include business, legal and operational risks and are not represented in the following discussion. Our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets within prudent risk parameters. Our risk management policies are set by a Risk Management Steering Committee, which is comprised of senior level Ameren officers. 71 Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with: o long term and short term variable rate debt; o fixed rate debt; o commercial paper; o auction rate long term debt; and o auction rate preferred stock. We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we hold within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. The following table presents the estimated increase (decrease) in our annual interest expense and net income if interest rates were to change by 1% on variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2003: Interest Expense Net Income(a) Ameren................................. $ 9 $ (6) UE..................................... 7 (4) CIPS................................... 1 (1) Genco.................................. 1 (1) CILCORP................................ 3 (2) CILCO.................................. 3 (2) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 37%. The model does not consider the effects of the reduced level of potential overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted. NYMEX traded futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the NYMEX and have nominal credit risk. On all other transactions, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction. Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables, executory contracts with market risk exposures and leverage lease investments. The risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups comprising our customer base. No non affiliated customer represents greater than 10%, in the aggregate, of our accounts receivable. Our revenues are primarily derived from sales of electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and Illinois. UE and Genco have credit exposure associated with accounts receivables from non affiliated companies for interchange sales. At December 31, 2003, UEs, Gencos and Marketing Companys combined credit exposure to non investment grade counterparties related to interchange sales was $4 million, net of collateral. We establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program which involves daily exposure reporting to senior management, master trading and netting agreements, and credit support such as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze each counterpartys financial condition prior to entering into sales, forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts and monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged leases. Equity Price Risk Our costs of providing non contributory defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, the rate of increase in healthcare costs and contributions made to the plans. The market value of our plan assets was affected by declines in the equity market for 2000 through 2002 for the pension and postretirement plans. As a result, at December 31, 2002, we recognized an 72 additional minimum pension liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," which resulted in an after tax charge to OCI and a reduction in stockholders equity of $102 million. At December 31, 2003, the minimum pension liability was reduced, resulting in OCI of $46 million and an increase in stockholders equity. The following table presents the minimum pension liability amounts, after taxes, for the Ameren Companies as of December 31, 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 Ameren(a)................................... $ 56 $ 102 UE.......................................... 34 62 CIPS........................................ 7 13 Genco....................................... 4 6 CILCORP(b).................................. 60 CILCO....................................... 13 30 (a) Excludes amounts for CILCORP and CILCO prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; includes amounts for non registrant Ameren subsidiaries. (b) 2002 amounts represent predecessor information. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. The amount of the pension liability as of December 31, 2003, was the result of asset returns, interest rates and our contributions to the plans during 2003. In future years, the liability recorded, the costs reflected in net income, or OCI, or cash contributions to the plans could increase materially without a recovery in equity markets in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 8.5%. If the fair value of the plan assets were to grow and exceed the accumulated benefit obligations in the future, then the recorded liability would be reduced and a corresponding amount of equity would be restored, net of taxes. UE also maintains trust funds, as required by the NRC and Missouri and Illinois state laws, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning. As of December 31, 2003, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities (68%), debt securities (30%), and cash and cash equivalents (2%) and totaled $212 million at fair value. By maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize the returns to be utilized to fund nuclear decommissioning costs. However, the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the fixed rate, fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trusts to various investment options. UEs exposure to equity price market risk is, in large part, mitigated, due to the fact that UE is currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in its rates. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, fuel and electricity to the extent they cannot be recovered through rates. UE has electric rate freezes in place in Missouri through June 30, 2006, and UE, CIPS and CILCO have electric rate freezes in place in Illinois through January 1, 2007. We utilize several techniques to mitigate risk, including utilizing derivative financial instruments. A derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value of some underlying asset. The derivative financial instruments that we use (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts and financial swap contracts) are dictated by risk management policies. With regard to UE, CIPS and CILCOs natural gas utility business, exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact there are gas cost recovery mechanisms (PGA clauses) in place in both Missouri and Illinois. These gas cost recovery mechanisms allow UE, CIPS and CILCO to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred costs of natural gas. We use fixed price forward contracts, as well as futures, options and financial swaps to manage risks associated with fuel and natural gas prices. The majority of our fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts. Since we do not have a provision similar to the PGA clause for our electric operations, we have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and nuclear fuel in order to manage our exposure to fuel prices. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. With regard to our electric generating operations, UE, Genco and CILCO are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent they must purchase natural gas to run CTs. Their natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas to intermediate and peaking units by optimizing transportation 73 and storage options and minimizing cost and price risk by structuring various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins. The following table presents the percentages of the required supply of coal for our coal fired power plants, nuclear fuel and natural gas for our CTs and distribution, as appropriate that are price hedged over the five year period from 2004 through 2008: 2004 2005 2006 2008 Ameren: Coal....................................................... 96% 67% 41% Nuclear fuel............................................... 100 100 32 Natural gas for generation................................. 38 11 2 Natural gas for distribution............................... 34 14 4 UE: Coal....................................................... 95% 62% 35% Nuclear fuel............................................... 100 100 32 Natural gas for generation................................. 31 11 2 Natural gas for distribution............................... 26 13 4 CIPS: Natural gas for distribution............................... 29% 17% 4% Genco: Coal....................................................... 100% 86% 64% Natural gas for generation................................. 28 19 6 CILCORP:(a) Coal....................................................... 92% 64% 35% Natural gas for distribution............................... 41 12 4 CILCO: Coal....................................................... 92% 64% 35% Natural gas for distribution............................... 41 12 4 (a) CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. The following table presents the estimated increase or decrease in our total fuel expense and net income if coal costs were to change by 1% on any requirements currently not covered by fixed price contracts for the five year period 2004 through 2008: Fuel Expense Net Income(a) Ameren.................................... $ 9 $ 5 UE........................................ 5 3 CIPS......................................

(b) CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. In the event of a significant change in coal prices, we would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources. See Supply for Electric Power under Part I, Item 1 of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydro and oil. With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel, UE has fixed priced and base price with escalation agreements and or inventories to fulfill its Callaway Nuclear Plant needs for uranium, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services through 2006. UE expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply 74 nuclear fuel during the expected remainder of the life of the plant, at prices which cannot now be accurately predicted. UEs strategy is to hedge some of its three year requirements. This strategy permits optimum timing of new forward contracts given the relatively long price cycles in the nuclear fuel markets and provides security of supply to protect against unforeseen market disruptions. Unlike electricity and natural gas markets, there are no sophisticated financial instruments in nuclear fuel markets so most hedging is done via inventories and forward contracts. Although we cannot completely eliminate the effects of gas price volatility, our strategy is designed to minimize the effect of market conditions on our results of operations. Our gas procurement strategy includes procuring natural gas under a portfolio of agreements with price structures, including fixed price, indexed price and embedded price hedges such as caps and collars. Our strategy also utilizes physical assets through storage, operator and balancing agreements to minimize price volatility. Amerens electric marketing strategy is to extract additional value from its generation facilities by selling energy in excess of needs into the long term and short term markets for term sales, and purchasing energy when the market price is less than the cost of generation. Our primary use of derivatives has involved transactions that are expected to reduce price risk exposure for us. With regard to our exposure to commodity price risk for purchased power and excess electricity sales, Ameren has a subsidiary, Ameren Energy, whose primary responsibility includes managing market risks associated with changing market prices for electricity purchased and sold on behalf of UE and Genco. In addition, Genco has sold nearly all of its available non rate regulated peak generation capacity for the summer of 2004 at various prices, the majority of which are fixed. Fair Value of Contracts Most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales. However, we utilize derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity and emission credits. Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel and electricity cause: o an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our firm commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sales prices under the firm commitment are compared with current commodity prices; o market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power to differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory under firm commitment; and o actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities to differ from anticipated cash outlays. The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are dictated by risk management policies and include forward contracts, futures contracts, options and swaps. We continually assess our supply and delivery commitment positions against forward market prices and internally forecasted forward prices and modify our exposure to market, credit and operational risk by entering into various offsetting transactions. In general, we believe these transactions serve to reduce our price risk.
