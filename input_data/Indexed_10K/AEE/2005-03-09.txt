ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OVERVIEW  Ameren Executive Summary  Overview  The most significant event for Ameren in 2004 was the announcement, financing and September 30th completion of the $2.3 billion acquisition of IP and an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI.  In 2004, Ameren recorded solid net earnings of $2.84 per share due to weather adjusted demand growth, the incremental earnings contribution resulting from the acquisitions of IP on September 30, 2004, and CILCORP Inc. on January 31, 2003, and increased earnings from our excess power sales. This earnings performance was accomplished despite very mild summer weather, a planned refueling and maintenance outage at our Callaway nuclear plant and the early issuance of common shares to fund the IP acquisition. Earnings in 2003 included unusual gains of 30 cents per share related to the adoption of an accounting standard and settlement of a dispute with a coal supplier, and there was no Callaway outage required in 2003.  Earnings  Total revenues in 2004 increased 12% to $5.2 billion from 2003. Growth in revenues was generated by the acquisitions of IP and CILCORP, which added $484 million in revenues in 2004. In addition, revenues benefited from weather adjusted growth, increased excess power sales due to greater availability of low cost generation and improved power prices, and higher natural gas delivery rates.  During 2004, factors that mitigated this improvement in revenues included extremely mild summer weather and the final $30 million annual rate reduction under the electric rate case settlement in Missouri that went into effect on April 1, 2004. Summer weather in 2004 in our service territory was the seventh mildest of the past 109 years, according to the National Weather service. Mild 2004 weather reduced revenues by an estimated $38 million in 2004, relative to 2003.  Operations and maintenance expenses increased 9% to $1.3 billion in 2004 from 2003, again, primarily because of the acquisitions. Expenses were also higher because of the two month refueling and maintenance outage at our Callaway nuclear plant, which increased expenses by $39 million, and purchased power costs by $24 million. A 70 day to 75 day outage is scheduled for 2005 in order to replace major equipment that is expected to increase the generating capacity of the Callaway plant by over 50 megawatts and improve future safety and reliability. Employee benefit costs also increased in 2004 as compared with 2003.  Operations expenses benefited from the $18 million refund of exit fees paid to the MISO upon re entry to that system in 2004 and lower labor costs.  Liquidity  Cash flows from operations of $1.1 billion in 2004 at Ameren, along with other funds, were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of $479 million and fund capital expenditures of $806 million. Cash flows from operations were reduced by a $295 million contribution to our pension plan.  Ameren issued approximately 30 million shares of common stock in 2004 to finance the acquisition of Illinois Power and an additional 20% interest in EEI. Net proceeds of $1.3 billion were used to pay the cash portion of the purchase price of $443 million, and reduce high cost debt and pay related fees at IP. Other financing activities primarily related to refinancing higher cost or maturing debt in Amerens other subsidiaries.  30 Outlook  We expect continued economic growth in our service territory to benefit electric demand in 2005 with natural gas and coal prices supporting power prices similar to 2004 levels. Amerens coal and related transportation costs rose in 2004 and are expected to rise 3% to 4% in 2005 and 2006. These costs are expected to increase more beyond 2006 as existing contracts are replaced. We also expect to realize synergies from the IP acquisition in 2005 and 2006.  Electric rates for Amerens operating subsidiaries have been fixed or declining for periods ranging from 12 years to 22 years. In addition, power supplied by Amerens non rate regulated generation subsidiaries has been subject to contracts to supply our Illinois distribution subsidiaries. In 2006, electric rate adjustment moratoriums and intercompany power supply contracts expire in Amerens regulatory jurisdictions. We believe that the prices reflected in these power supply contracts are below current market prices. In 2005, we will begin the process of preparing and filing utility cost of service studies and filing a proposed framework for power procurement that will determine electric rates in 2006 and beyond.  The EPA has proposed more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants. Between 2005 and 2015, Ameren expects its subsidiaries will be required to spend between $1.4 and $1.9 billion to retrofit its power plants with pollution control equipment. Approximately two thirds of this investment will be in the Companys regulated Missouri operations and therefore is expected to be recoverable over time from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts invested in non rate regulated operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust for this increased investment by the industry.  General  Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company registered with the SEC under the PUHCA. Amerens primary asset is the common stock of its subsidiaries. Amerens subsidiaries operate rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses, rate regulated natural gas distribution businesses and non rate regulated electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois as discussed below. Dividends on Amerens common stock are dependent on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed description of our principal subsidiaries.  UE operates a rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution business, and a rate regulated natural gas distribution business in Missouri and Illinois. CIPS operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. Genco operates a non rate regulated electric generation business. CILCO is a subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company) and operates a rate regulated electric transmission and distribution business, a primarily non rate regulated electric generation business, through its subsidiary, AERG, and a rate regulated natural gas distribution business in Illinois. IP operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information.  The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority owned subsidiaries. As the acquisition of IP occurred on September 30, 2004, Amerens Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows for the periods prior to September 30, 2004, and Amerens Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003, do not reflect IPs results of operations or financial position. Financial information of CILCORP and CILCO reflected in Amerens consolidated financial statements include the period from January 31, 2003, when these companies were acquired. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information on the accounting for the IP and CILCORP acquisitions. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, unless otherwise indicated.  In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, certain information is expressed in cents per share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect Amerens earnings. We believe this per share information is useful because it enables readers to understand the impact of these factors on Amerens earnings per share. All references in this report to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares outstanding during the applicable year.  IP Acquisition  On September 30, 2004, Ameren completed the acquisition from Dynegy of all the common stock and 662,924 shares of preferred stock of IP (based in Decatur, Illinois) and an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI and its subsidiaries. Ameren acquired IP to complement its existing Illinois electric and gas operations. The purchase included IPs rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business serving approximately 600,000 electric and 415,000 gas customers in areas contiguous to our existing Illinois utility service territories. With the acquisition, IP became an Ameren subsidiary operating as AmerenIP. For a discussion of the regulatory agency approvals granted in connection with this acquisition, see Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.   31  The total transaction value was $2.3 billion. It included the assumption of $1.8 billion of IP debt and preferred stock and consideration, including transaction costs, of $443 million cash, net of $51 million cash acquired. In February 2005, Ameren received $5 million from Dynegy as a final working capital settlement. Ameren placed $100 million of the cash portion of the purchase price in a six year escrow account, pending resolution of certain contingent environmental obligations of IP and other Dynegy affiliates for which Ameren has been provided indemnification by Dynegy. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on the IP environmental matter to which the indemnification and escrow applies. In addition, this transaction included a fixed price power supply agreement for IPs annual purchase in 2005 and 2006 of 2,800 megawatts of electricity from DYPM. The contract was marked to fair value at closing of the IP acquisition. This agreement is expected to supply about 70% of IPs electric customer requirements during those two years. The remaining 30% of its power needs in 2005 and 2006 will be supplied under other arrangements. In the event that any of IPs suppliers are unable to supply the electricity required by existing agreements, IP would be forced to find alternative suppliers to meet its load requirements, thus exposing IP to market price risk, which could have a material impact on Amerens and IPs results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.  Amerens financing plan for funding this acquisition included the issuance of new Ameren common stock. Ameren issued an aggregate of approximately 30 million common shares in February 2004 and July 2004, which generated net proceeds of about $1.3 billion. Proceeds from these issuances were used to finance the cash portion of the purchase price and to reduce high cost IP debt assumed as part of this transaction and to pay related premiums. See Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on redemptions and repurchases of certain IP indebtedness after the acquisition.  Ameren expects the acquisition of IP to be accretive to earnings in the first two years of ownership. That belief is based on a variety of assumptions related to power prices, interest rates, and synergies, among other things. In December 2004, 230 IP employees accepted a voluntary separation opportunity, which provides an enhanced separation benefit and extended medical and dental benefits. Employees who accepted the voluntary separation opportunity will leave IP throughout 2005 as business needs warrant. These voluntary separations are consistent with Amerens plan for the integration of IP and conditions in the ICC order approving the acquisition, which relate to the realization of administrative synergies from the acquisition. Estimated separation costs of $26 million have been deferred as a regulatory asset of future recovery from customers, which is also consistent with the ICC order.  For income tax purposes, Ameren and Dynegy have elected to treat Amerens acquisition of IP stock as an asset acquisition under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Earnings Summary  Our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations caused by winter heating and summer cooling demand. With approximately 85% of Amerens revenues directly subject to regulation by various state and federal agencies, decisions by regulators can have a material impact on the price we charge for our services. Our non rate regulated sales are subject to market conditions for power. We principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil in our operations. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the world economic and political environment, weather, supply and demand levels and many other factors. We do not have fuel or purchased power cost recovery mechanisms in Missouri or Illinois for our electric utility businesses, but we do have gas cost recovery mechanisms in each state for our gas delivery businesses. The electric and gas rates for UE in Missouri are set through June 2006, and are set for CIPS, CILCO and IP in Illinois through the end of 2006, so that cost decreases or increases will not be immediately reflected in rates. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our cost of borrowing and pension and postretirement benefits. We employ various risk management strategies in order to try to reduce our exposure to commodity risks and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of our power plants and transmission and distribution systems and the level of purchased power costs, operating and administrative costs, and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control in order to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.  Amerens net income for 2004, 2003, and 2002, was $530 million ($2.84 per share), $524 million ($3.25 per share), and $382 million ($2.60 per share), respectively. In 2003, Amerens net income included an after tax gain of $31 million (19 cents per share) related to the settlement of a dispute over mine reclamation issues with a coal supplier and a net cumulative effect after tax gain of $18 million (11 cents per share) associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The coal contract settlement gain recaptured coal costs, plus accrued interest, previously paid to a coal supplier for future reclamation of a coal mine that principally supplied a UE power plant. The SFAS No. 143 net gain resulted principally from the elimination from accumulated deprecation of accrued costs of removal for non rate regulated assets; these accrued costs of removal were not legal obligations. 32  The following table presents net cumulative effect after tax gains (losses) recorded upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 in 2003:  Net Cumulative Effect After Tax Gain (Loss) Ameren(a) $ 18 Genco 18 CILCORP(b)(c) 4 CILCO 24 IP(c) (2 )  (a) Excludes amounts for IP and CILCORP as SFAS No. 143 was adopted prior to the acquisitions by Ameren. (b) CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (c) Represents predecessor information.  In 2002, Amerens net income included after tax restructuring charges of $58 million (40 cents per share) for a voluntary employee retirement program; the retirement of some facilities at UEs Venice, Illinois power plant; and the temporary suspension of operation of two coal fired generating units at Gencos Meredosia, Illinois power plant. See Note 7 Restructuring Charges and Other Special Items to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information.  The following table presents a reconciliation of Amerens net income to net income, excluding restructuring charges and other special items discussed above, as well as the effect of SFAS No. 143 adoption, all net of taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Ameren believes that this reconciliation presents results from continuing operations on a more comparable basis. However, net income, or earnings per share, excluding these items is not a presentation defined under GAAP, and it may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP presentation included in Amerens financial statements.  2004 2003 2002 Net income $ 530 $ 524 $ 382 Earnings per share diluted $ 2.84 $ 3.25 $ 2.60 Restructuring charges and other special items, net of taxes (31 ) 58 SFAS No. 143 adoption gain, net of taxes (18 ) Total restructuring charges and other special items, and the effect of SFAS No. 143 adoption, net of taxes $ $ (49 ) $ 58  per share $ $ (0.30 ) $ 0.40 Net income, excluding restructuring charges and other special items, and the effect of SFAS No. 143 adoption $ 530 $ 475 $ 440 Earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges and other special items, and the effect of SFAS No.  143 adoption diluted $ 2.84 $ 2.95 $ 3.00  Excluding the gains on the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the settlement of the coal mine reclamation dispute in the prior year, Amerens net income increased $55 million, and earnings per share decreased 11 cents, in 2004 as compared with 2003. The change in net income was primarily due to organic growth in revenues; increased margins on interchange sales, primarily due to greater availability of low cost generation (16 cents per share); gas delivery rate increases (10 cents per share); lower labor costs (8 cents per share); the MISO refund of previously paid exit fees upon UEs and CIPS re entry into the MISO in the second quarter of 2004 (6 cents per share); and results of CILCORPs inclusion for an additional month and IPs inclusion for three months in 2004. Partially offsetting these increases to income were increased fuel and purchased power costs and other operations and maintenance costs as a result of UEs Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in the second quarter of 2004 (22 cents per share), extremely mild 2004 weather conditions (estimated at 12 to 16 cents per share), electric rate reductions (13 cents per share), and higher employee benefit costs (11 cents per share). Increased common shares outstanding also reduced Amerens earnings per share in 2004 as compared with 2003.  Excluding the gains related to the coal mine reclamation settlement and an accounting change in 2003 and the restructuring loss in 2002, Amerens net income in 2003 increased $35 million, and earnings per share decreased 5 cents as compared to 2002. The change in net income was primarily due to the acquisition of CILCORP; favorable margins on interchange sales (35 cents per share), due to improved power prices in the energy markets and greater low cost generation available for sale; organic growth; lower labor costs due to the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003 (11 cents per share); lower maintenance expenses in Amerens pre CILCORP acquisition operations (25 cents per share); and a decrease in Other Miscellaneous Expense as a result of the expensing of economic development and energy assistance programs in the second quarter of 2002 related to the UE Missouri electric rate case settlement. These benefits to Amerens 2003 net income were partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions (estimated at 40 to 50 cents per share), primarily due to cooler summer weather in Amerens pre CILCORP territory than the normal conditions experienced in 2002; an electric rate reduction in UEs Missouri service territory that went into effect in April 2003 (11 cents per share); lower sales of emission credits (7 cents per share); and higher employee benefit costs (8 cents per share). Increased common shares outstanding  33 also reduced Amerens earnings per share in 2003 as compared with 2002.  As a holding company, Amerens net income and cash flows are primarily generated by its principal subsidiaries: UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. The following table presents the contribution by Amerens principal subsidiaries to Amerens consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:  2004 2003 2002 Net income: UE(a) $ 373 $ 441 $ 336 CIPS 29 26 23 Genco(a) 107 75 32 CILCORP(b) 10 14 IP(c) 27 Other(d) (16 ) (32 ) (9 Ameren net income $ 530 $ 524 $ 382 (a) Includes earnings from unregulated interchange power sales that provided in 2004, $75 million of UEs net income (2003 $58 million; 2002 $20 million) and $39 million of Gencos net income (2003 $30 million; 2002 $10 million). (b) Excludes net income prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (c) Excludes net income prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004. (d) Includes corporate general and administrative expenses, transition costs associated with the CILCORP and IP acquisitions and other non rate regulated operations.  Acquisition Accounting  The amortization of noncash purchase accounting fair value adjustments at IP increased Amerens and IPs net income by $26 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004, as compared with the prior year period. The amortization of the fair value adjustments at IP that increased net income were related to pension and postretirement liabilities, long term debt, a power supply contract with EEI that expires in 2005, and a power supply contract with Dynegy for 2,800 megawatts that expired in 2004. Partially offsetting these items was the amortization of the fair value adjustment related to a power supply contract for 700 megawatts that also expired in 2004. Concurrent with its acquisition of IP, Ameren negotiated a contract with Dynegy to supply IP 2,800 megawatts for 2005 and 2006. The fair value adjustments associated with this agreement and the EEI contract noted above will be amortized over the terms of the contracts and will have a net favorable impact on IPs net income. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) impact on IPs net income related to the amortization of purchase accounting fair value adjustments during the three months ended December 31, 2004:   2004 Statement of Income line item: Other operations and maintenance(a) $ 7 Interest(b) 10 Fuel and purchased power(c) 26 Income taxes(d) (17 ) Impact on net income $ 26 (a) Related to the adjustment to fair value of the pension plan and postretirement plans. (b) Related to the adjustment to fair value of all the IP debt assumed at acquisition on September 30, 2004. The net write up to fair value of all the IP debt assumed, excluding early redemption premiums, is being amortized over the anticipated remaining life of the debt. See Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. (c) Related to the amortization of fair value adjustments to power supply contracts. (d) Tax effect of the above amortization adjustments.  The amortization of noncash purchase accounting fair value adjustments at EEI decreased Amerens net income. The amortization of fair value adjustments at EEI related to the additional 20% interest acquired by Ameren on September 30, 2004, for plant in service, emission credits and a power supply agreement with IP that expires in 2005. The amortization of the fair value adjustment of the power supply agreement of $3 million in 2004 between IP and EEI had no affect on net income at a consolidated Ameren level because IP is amortizing its fair value adjustment for the same power supply agreement. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) impact on net income related to the amortization of purchase accounting fair value adjustments of EEI during the three months ended December 31, 2004:  2004 Statement of Income line item: Fuel and purchased power(a) $ (4 ) Depreciation(b) (1 ) Income taxes(c) 2 Impact on net income $ (3 ) (a) Related to the amortization of emission credits and a power supply contract. (b) Includes the amortization of the fair value adjustment related to plant assets. (c) Tax effect of the above amortization adjustments.  The amortization of noncash purchase accounting fair value adjustments at CILCORP increased Amerens and CILCORPs net income in 2004 by $6 million compared with $24 million for the 11 months in the prior year. The amortization of the fair value adjustments that increased net income were related to pension and postretirement liabilities, coal contract liabilities, and long term debt. The amortization of fair value adjustments that decreased net income were related to electric plant in service, purchased power, and emission credits. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) impact on Amerens and CILCORPs net income related to the amortization of purchase accounting fair value  34 adjustments during 2004 and the 11 months ended December 31, 2003:   2004 2003 Statement of Income line item: Other operations and maintenance(a) $ 13 $ 39 Interest(b) 8 7 Fuel and purchased power(c) (6 ) 1 Depreciation and amortization(d) (5 ) (7 ) Income taxes(e) (4 ) (16 ) Impact on net income $ 6 $ 24 (a) Related to the adjustment to fair value of the pension plan and postretirement plans; retail customer contracts and investment assets. (b) Related to CILCORPs 9.375% senior notes due 2029 and 8.70% senior notes due 2009 being written up to fair value and amortized over the average remaining life of the debt. See Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. (c) Related to emission credits and coal contracts. (d) Related to plant assets at Duck Creek, E.D. Edwards, and Sterling Avenue being amortized over the remaining useful lives of the plants. (e) Tax effect of the above amortization adjustments.  The total purchase accounting adjustments for IP, EEI and CILCORP had a net favorable impact on Amerens net income of $29 million for the year 2004.  Electric Operations  The following tables present the favorable (unfavorable) variations in electric margins, defined as electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs, from prior year for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. We consider electric and interchange margins useful measures to analyze the change in profitability of our electric operations between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to our financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, electric and interchange margins may not be a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we are providing elsewhere in this report.  The variation for Ameren shows the contribution from IP for the last three months of 2004 and the contribution from CILCORP for January 2004 as separate line items, which allows an easier comparison with other margin components. The variation in IP electric margins in 2004 include the purchase accounting adjustments discussed above; they are compared with the full years 2003 and 2002, when Ameren did not own IP and it did not contribute to Amerens electric margins. The variations in CILCORP and CILCO electric margins in 2004 and 2003 are compared with the full years 2003 and 2002. Before January 31, 2003, Ameren did not own CILCORP and CILCO and they did not contribute to Amerens electric margins.  2004 versus 2003 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP (b) CILCO IP (c) Electric revenue change: CILCORP January 2004 $ 49 $ $ $ $ $ $ IP Since September 30, 2004 229 Effect of weather (estimate) (38 ) (24 ) (12 ) (1 ) (1 ) (16 ) Growth and other (estimate) 97 43 (5 ) 65 (196 ) (196 ) (25 ) Rate reductions (34 ) (34 ) Interchange revenues 70 20 23 27 27 EEI (37 ) Total $ 336 $ 5 $ (17 ) $ 88 $ (170 ) $ (170 ) $ (41 ) Fuel and purchased power change: CILCORP January 2004 $ (26 ) $ $ $ $ $ $ IP Since September 30, 2004 (128 ) Fuel: Generation and other (24 ) 6 (23 ) (17 ) (7 ) Price (9 ) (2 ) (6 ) 11 11 Purchased power (28 ) (24 ) 16 2 162 159 57 EEI 7 Total $ (208 ) $ (20 ) $ 16 $ (27 ) $ 156 $ 163 $ 57 Net change in electric margins $ 128 $ (15 ) $ (1 ) $ 61 $ (14 ) $ (7 ) $ 16  2003 versus 2002 Ameren(a) ) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP (b) ) CILCO (b) ) IP (c) ) Electric revenue change: CILCORP acquisition $ 512 $ $ $ $ $ $ Effect of weather (estimate) (121 ) (96 ) (16 ) (11 ) (11 ) (29 ) Growth and other (estimate) 46 39 (88 ) 5 44 44 Rate reductions (34 ) (34 ) (8 ) Interchange revenues 80 62 40 9 9 (7 ) EEI (51 ) Total $ 432 $ (29 ) $ (104 ) $ 45 $ 42 $ 42 $ (44 ) Fuel and purchased power change: CILCORP acquisition $ (276 ) $ $ $ $ $ $ 35 2003 versus 2002 Ameren(a) ) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP(b) CILCO(b) IP(c) ) Fuel: Generation and other (28 ) (38 ) 23 (5 ) (9 ) Price 3 (5 ) 8 Purchased power 63 50 77 (33 ) (50 ) (47 ) (3 ) EEI (7 ) Total $ (245 ) $ 7 $ 77 $ (2 ) $ (55 ) $ (56 ) $ (3 ) Net change in electric margins $ 187 $ (22 ) $ (27 ) $ 43 $ (13 ) $ (14 ) $ (47 ) (a) Excludes amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; excludes amounts for CILCORP prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non Registrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.

(c) Includes predecessor information for periods prior to September 30, 2004.  Ameren  2004 versus 2003  Amerens electric margin increased $128 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in the current year, electric margin increased $4 million for 2004. Strong organic growth due to improved economic conditions and increased margins on interchange sales more than offset the effect of unfavorable weather conditions, increased fuel and purchased power costs due to the second quarter 2004 Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage, and rate reductions in the current year as compared with the prior year. In addition, revenues from emission credit sales decreased $7 million in 2004 as compared with 2003.   According to the National Weather Service, summer weather in 2004 in Amerens service territory was the seventh mildest in the past 109 years. Cooling degree days during that period in our service territory were down approximately 20% from both normal conditions and the prior year. Warmer winter weather in 2004 also resulted in heating degree days that were down approximately 7% in 2004 in our service territory as compared with 2003, and down approximately 10% from normal conditions. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP sales and three months of IP sales in the current year, residential sales were flat compared to the prior year, as organic growth offset the impact of the unfavorable weather conditions. Commercial and industrial sales increased 2% in 2004 due to improved economic conditions.  Rate reductions resulting from the 2002 UE electric rate case settlement in Missouri negatively affected electric revenues during 2004. Annual reductions of $50 million, $30 million, and $30 million were effective April 1, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively.  Margins on interchange sales increased $37 million in 2004 as compared with the same period in 2003, because of increased availability of low cost generation resulting from record power generation and reduced demand from native load customers due to the mild summer weather. In addition to increased availability of low cost power, the current year also benefited because both higher natural gas and coal prices contributed to increased power prices. Average realized power prices on interchange sales increased to approximately $34 per megawatthour in 2004 from approximately $32 per megawatthour in 2003. In 2004, Amerens base load coal fired electric generating plants average capacity factor was approximately 76%, despite the extremely mild weather, as compared with 73% in 2003, and the equivalent availability factor was approximately 87%, as compared with 85% in the prior year period.  EEIs revenues decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 because of reduced emission credit sales and decreased sales to the DOE, which also resulted in a decrease in purchased power. EEIs sales of emission credits were $2 million in 2004 as compared with $10 million in 2003.  Amerens fuel and purchased power costs increased $54 million, excluding the additional month of CILCORP and the additional three months of IP in the current year, as compared with 2003, because of increased power purchases necessitated by the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage as well as increased fossil generation and fuel prices.  2003 versus 2002  Amerens electric margin increased $187 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. Increases in electric margin in 2003 were attributable primarily to the acquisition of CILCORP, increased margins on interchanges sales, and organic sales growth, partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions relative to 2002, lower sales of emission credits, and rate reductions. CILCORPs contribution to Amerens electric margin for the 11 months ended December 31, 2003, was $236 million. Margins on interchange sales increased $92 million in 2003 because of improved power prices in the energy markets and increased low cost generation availability. Average realized power prices on interchange sales increased to approximately $32 per megawatthour in 2003 from approximately $25 per megawatthour in 2002. Availability of coal fired generating plants increased to 85% in 2003 from 82% in 2002 because there were fewer scheduled and 36  unscheduled outages. In addition, there was no refueling outage at our Callaway nuclear plant in 2003.  The unfavorable weather conditions were the cooler summer weather in 2003 versus warmer than normal conditions in the same periods in 2002. Cooling degree days were down approximately 25% in 2003 in our service territory compared with 2002 and down approximately 10% from normal conditions. Heating degree days in 2003 were comparable to 2002 and normal conditions. In Amerens pre CILCORP acquisition service territory, weather sensitive residential and commercial electric kilowatthour sales declined 4% and 2%, respectively, in 2003 compared with 2002. Industrial electric kilowatthour sales increased 2% in 2003 in Amerens pre CILCORP acquisition service territory because of improving economic conditions.  Annual rate reductions of $50 million and $30 million were effective April 1, 2002 and 2003, respectively, as a result of the 2002 UE electric rate case settlement in Missouri. Those reductions negatively affected electric revenues in 2003 and 2002.  EEIs revenues decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002 because of lower emission credit sales and decreased sales to the DOE, which also resulted in a decrease in fuel and purchased power. EEIs sales of emission credits were $10 million in 2003 as compared with $38 million in 2002.  Amerens fuel and purchased power increased in 2003 compared with 2002 because of increased kilowatthour sales, related primarily to the addition of CILCORP. Excluding CILCORP, fuel and purchased power decreased in 2003 primarily because of the greater availability of low cost generation.   UE  UEs electric margin decreased $15 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. Residential sales were comparable with prior year sales as the effect of mild summer weather was offset by organic growth. Rate reductions from the 2002 rate case settlement negatively affected electric revenues during 2004. Partially offsetting these decreases to electric revenues were increased interchange margins and higher emission sales. Margins on interchange sales increased $23 million in 2004 as compared to 2003, because of increased availability of low cost generation and higher power prices. Revenues from emission credit sales decreased $3 million in the current year as compared with 2003. Fuel and purchased power increased $20 million in 2004, primarily because of increased purchased power of $24 million resulting from the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage during the second quarter of 2004, partially offset by decreased demand due to mild summer weather conditions in 2004.  UEs electric margin decreased $22 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. Decreases in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to the unfavorable weather conditions and the rate reductions resulting from the 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement mentioned above. However, margins on interchange sales increased $64 million because of improved power prices in the energy markets and increased low cost generation availability. Fuel and purchased power decreased slightly in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of lower transmission costs.  CIPS  CIPS 2004 electric margin was comparable with the margin in 2003. Electric margin was favorably affected by an industrial customers switching from CIPS to Marketing Company and the elimination of the negative margin associated with this customer. Unfavorable weather conditions offset the above increases to margin.  CIPS electric margin decreased $27 million in 2003, as compared with 2002, primarily because of the unfavorable weather conditions and several customers switching from CIPS to Marketing Company. Commencing in 2002, all of CIPS, CILCOs, IPs and UEs Illinois residential, commercial and industrial customers had a choice in electric suppliers according to the Illinois Customer Choice Law. CIPS continues to provide electric delivery service to these customers, and it charges them ICC approved delivery service tariff rates for that service. Customer switching resulted in a $95 million decline in CIPS revenues which is included in the line item growth and other in the table above, offset by a related decrease of $85 million in purchased power for 2003.  Genco  Gencos electric margin increased $61 million in 2004, as compared with 2003. The increase in electric margin was primarily attributable to an increase in wholesale and retail margins due to sales to new customers and increased availability of lower cost generation. Interchange margins increased $14 million in 2004, as compared with 2003 because power prices were higher and more low cost power was available for sale due to the mild weather.  Gencos electric margin increased $43 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. Increases in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to increased margins on interchange sales. Interchange margins on interchange sales increased $33 million in 2003 because of improved power prices in the energy markets. Fuel and purchased power increased $2 million in 2003 because of higher purchased power costs associated with higher energy prices and lower generation availability. These increased costs were partially offset by lower generation costs due to a 12% decline in megawatthour generation. The decline in generation during 2003 was primarily attributable to the timing of outages at Gencos power plants and unexpected downtime and unfavorable margins associated with Gencos CTs.   37  CILCORP and CILCO  Electric margin decreased $14 million at CILCORP and $7 million at CILCO in 2004 as compared with 2003. Decreases in electric margin were primarily attributable to reduced revenues due to two large CILCO industrial customers switching to Marketing Company in July and October 2003 and transfers of other non rate regulated customers to Marketing Company ($168 million). Fuel and purchased power also decreased because several customers switched to Marketing Company.  CILCORPs electric margin decreased $13 million and CILCOs electric margin decreased $14 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. Decreases in electric margin in 2003 were primarily attributable to lower margin per megawatthour sold on a non rate regulated basis to electric customers outside CILCOs service territory, the switch of the two large CILCO customers to Marketing Company discussed above, and unfavorable weather conditions. In addition, fuel and purchased power at CILCORP increased as compared with CILCO, because of the net effect of purchase accounting fair value adjustments related to emission allowances, partially offset by those associated with coal contracts.  IP  IPs electric margin increased $16 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. The increase in electric margin was principally due to lower purchased power costs as a result of purchase accounting adjustments ($26 million). Revenues were reduced because of unfavorable summer weather. Electric margin was also unfavorably affected by industrial customers who chose alternative suppliers.  The decrease in electric margin of $47 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 reflected lower residential and commercial sales volume due to cooler summer weather, the full year impact of the 5% residential rate decrease that was effective May 1, 2002; and lower industrial sales due to the combined effect of customers who chose alternative suppliers and general economic conditions. Electricity purchases increased in 2003 as compared with 2002. A higher average cost per unit was offset by lower purchased volumes due to the cooler weather and economic conditions. Decreased interchange revenues in 2003 resulted from the favorable reversal of previously recorded litigation reserves with an interchange customer in 2002.  Gas Operations  The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) variations in gas margins, defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale, as compared with the prior periods for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. We consider gas margin to be a useful measure to analyze the change in profitability of our gas utility operations between periods. We have included the table below as a complement to our financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, gas margin may not be a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we are providing elsewhere in this report.  2004 2003 Ameren(a) $ 77 $ 74 UE 9 (2 ) CIPS 6 1 CILCORP(b) 8 3 CILCO 6 6 IP(c) (4 ) 10 (a) Excludes amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; excludes amounts for CILCORP prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non Registrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (b) Includes predecessor information for periods prior to January 31, 2003. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (c) Includes predecessor information for periods prior to September 30, 2004.  Gas margins at Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO increased in 2004 primarily because of delivery rate increases, partially offset by milder winter weather conditions. Amerens gas margin also increased $13 million because of the additional month of CILCORP results and $40 million because of the three months of IP results in 2004. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP and the three months of IP in 2004, Amerens sales were down 5% as a result of the mild winter weather conditions. IPs gas margin decreased $4 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of milder winter weather in 2004.  Amerens gas margin increased in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of $73 million added by the acquisition of CILCORP. The gas margins at UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 were comparable to 2002 as heating degree days were consistent with 2002. Gas margin at IP was higher in 2003 as compared with 2002 because of colder weather in the first quarter of 2003 in IPs service territory.  Operating Expenses and Other Statement of Income Items  Other Operations and Maintenance  Ameren  Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $113 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. The additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in the current year accounted for $15 million and $43 million, respectively, of other operations and maintenance expense in 2004 as compared with 2003. Additionally, expenses at Ameren increased $55 million in 2004, primarily because of increased maintenance expenses stemming from   38  the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant during the second quarter of 2004. The outage lasted 64 days and resulted in incremental maintenance costs of $39 million. Refueling and maintenance outages occur approximately every 18 months. They typically include the replacement of fuel and the performance of maintenance and inspections. The previous refueling and maintenance outage occurred in the fall of 2002. In addition to the Callaway nuclear plant outage expenses, employee benefit costs were $43 million higher, primarily because of increased pension and postretirement medical costs. The adoption in the second quarter of 2004, retroactive to January 1, 2004, of FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, resulted in the recognition of nontaxable federal subsidies expected to be provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act (the Medicare Prescription Drug Subsidy), which partially offset the employee benefit cost increases noted above ($11 million). See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. Expenses at Ameren, UE and CIPS were reduced in 2004 by $18 million, $13 million, and $5 million, respectively, from the refund to UE and CIPS of previously paid exit fees upon their re entry into the MISO. Lower labor costs ($21 million) in 2004 also partially offset the above increases to other operations and maintenance expenses.  Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $64 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily due to the $135 million added by the acquisition of CILCORP, transition costs related to the CILCORP acquisition, higher employee benefit costs ($17 million), and a net increase in injuries and damages costs based on claims experience ($6 million). These increases in other operations and maintenance expenses were partially offset by lower labor costs resulting primarily from the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003 and lower plant maintenance costs because of the number and timing of outages ($60 million). There was no refueling outage at the Callaway nuclear plant in 2003.  UE  Other operations and maintenance expenses at UE increased $38 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of increased power plant maintenance expenses as a result of the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant discussed above ($39 million). In addition to the Callaway outage expenses, employee benefit costs were increased by $8 million. These were primarily increased pension costs, partially offset by reduced postretirement costs due to the adoption of FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 106 2, noted above. In addition, the refund of exit fees upon UEs re entry into the MISO as discussed above ($13 million) also partially offset the increased costs.  UEs other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $49 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of lower labor costs related to the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003 and lower plant maintenance costs ($34 million), partially offset by the higher employee benefit costs ($10 million) and an increase in injuries and damages costs ($3 million).  CIPS  CIPS other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $8 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of CIPS portion of the MISO exit fee refund ($5 million) as discussed above and lower labor costs, partially offset by increased employee benefit costs ($2 million).  CIPS other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $5 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of lower labor costs related to the voluntary employee retirement program implemented in early 2003, and a decrease in environmental remediation costs ($3 million), partially offset by an increase in injuries and damages costs of $8 million.  Genco  Other operations and maintenance expenses at Genco decreased $6 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of a reduction in power plant maintenance ($10 million) as a result of fewer outages and lower labor costs, partially offset by increased employee benefit costs ($5 million).  Gencos other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $21 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of a reduction in consulting costs at its coal fired generation plants, a decrease in commitment fees for the use of UEs and CIPS electric transmission lines ($5 million), and a net decrease in injuries and damages costs ($3 million).  CILCORP and CILCO  CILCORPs other operations and maintenance expenses increased by $41 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of higher employee benefit costs ($12 million), and additional injuries and damages costs ($4 million). Pursuant to an arrangement entered into between Ameren and AES in conjunction with the acquisition of CILCORP, AES indemnified CILCORP and CILCO for the $13 million after tax cost of the $21 million settlement of a litigation claim by Enron Power Marketing Inc. As a result, other operations and maintenance expenses includes the net   39  cost of $8 million while income taxes reflect a tax benefit of $8 million, resulting in no net income statement effect. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information on the Enron Power Marketing, Inc. litigation claim.  CILCOs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $33 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of the litigation settlement, discussed above, additional injuries and damage costs ($4 million), increased maintenance ($3 million), increased technology expenses ($3 million), and higher overhead allocations. Partially offsetting these increases to other operations and maintenance expenses at CILCORP and CILCO were reduced labor costs in 2004.  CILCORPs other operations and maintenance expenses in 2003 were comparable to 2002. CILCOs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $19 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs ($19 million) and higher bad debt expense ($5 million), substantially offset by reduced environmental costs ($9 million) for remediation of elevated boron levels at the Duck Creek power plant recycle pond in 2002.  IP  IPs other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $19 million in 2004 as compared with 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from the reimbursement of the MISO exit fee and RTO development costs ($9 million), as well as reduced labor costs and other operating efficiencies ($12 million), partially offset by higher employee benefit costs ($8 million) and costs associated with injuries and damages reserves.  The increase in other operations and maintenance expenses at IP of $12 million for 2003 over 2002 was primarily due to higher employee benefit costs ($11 million) and insurance claims and an increase in legal reserves ($16 million), partially offset by operating efficiencies and reduced technology expenditures ($14 million).  Voluntary Retirement and Other Restructuring Charges and Coal Contract Settlement  See Note 7 Restructuring Charges and Other Special Items to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.  Depreciation and Amortization  2004 versus 2003  Amerens, UEs and IPs depreciation and amortization expenses increased $38 million, $10 million and $2 million, respectively, in 2004 as compared with 2003, because of capital additions. Depreciation and amortization expenses at Ameren also increased in 2004 because of the inclusion of the additional month of CILCORP expenses of $6 million and three months of IP expenses of $21 million. Amortization of regulatory assets at IP decreased $9 million in 2004 from 2003 as the transition cost regulatory asset was written off in purchase accounting in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of IP.  Depreciation and amortization expenses at CIPS and Genco in 2004 were comparable to 2003.  Depreciation and amortization expenses at CILCORP and CILCO decreased $9 million and $6 million, respectively, in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because reduced expenses as a result of property retirements at the end of 2003 exceeded the increased expense from new capital additions in 2004. CILCORP depreciation was also favorably affected by reduced purchase accounting amortization adjustments.  2003 versus 2002  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $88 million and $6 million at Ameren and Genco, respectively, in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase at Ameren was primarily due to the inclusion of $72 million of CILCORP expense in 2003. In addition, depreciation and amortization expenses increased at Ameren and Genco because of new capital additions.  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $3 million at UE in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of capital additions, partially offset by a decrease of $5 million resulting from a reduction in depreciation rates. The reduction in depreciation rates of $5 million in 2003 was based on the updated analysis of asset values, service lives, and accumulated depreciation levels that was required by UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement.  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $6 million at CILCORP in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the book value of the Duck Creek and E.D. Edwards power plants and the Sterling Avenue peaking station ($7 million).  Depreciation and amortization expenses at CIPS, CILCO and IP in 2003 were comparable to 2002. Amortization of regulatory assets at IP decreased $32 million in 2003 from 2002 primarily due to reduced amortization of the transition cost regulatory asset. In 2002, IPs increased financial performance allowed for additional recognition of amortization as compared with 2003.   40  Taxes Other Than Income Taxes  2004 versus 2003  Taxes other than income taxes increased $13 million at Ameren in 2004 as compared with 2003. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP ($6 million) and the three months of IP $15 million included in the current year, taxes other than income taxes decreased $8 million. The decrease was primarily due to decreased gross receipts taxes, partially offset by increased property taxes.  UEs taxes other than income taxes increased $9 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because property taxes were higher in 2004.  Taxes other than income taxes at CIPS, Genco and IP in 2004 were comparable to 2003.  Taxes other than income taxes decreased at CILCORP and CILCO by $13 million and $14 million, respectively, in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because gross receipts taxes were down as a result of customers switching to Marketing Company.  2003 versus 2002   At Ameren, taxes other than income taxes increased $37 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because the acquisition of CILCORP added $34 million.  At UE, taxes other than income taxes decreased $5 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, because of a decrease in gross receipts taxes ($2 million) related to lower native load customer sales in milder weather and a decrease in real estate taxes resulting from lower assessments in 2003.  Taxes other than income taxes at IP increased $10 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because 2002 expenses benefited from a favorable audit conclusion on gross receipts taxes of $4 million.  At Genco, taxes other than income taxes increased $9 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of adjustments related to property tax assessments and increased property taxes associated with the four CTs added in the third and fourth quarters of 2002.  CIPS, CILCORPs and CILCOs taxes other than income taxes in 2003 were comparable to 2002.  Other Income and Deductions  2004 versus 2003  Amerens other income and deductions increased $18 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of increased interest income ($8 million) from the temporary investment of proceeds from Amerens February and July 2004 equity offerings and increased allowance for funds used during construction ($6 million). The additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in the current year had a minimal impact on other income and deductions.  Total other income at IP decreased $35 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because interest income was reduced after the elimination of IPs Note Receivable from Former Affiliate in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of IP. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the note elimination. Other income and deductions includes interest income of $128 million for 2004 as compared with $170 million in 2003 under IPs Note Receivable from Former Affiliate.  Other income and deductions at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO were comparable in 2004 to 2003. See Note 8 Other Income and Deductions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information.  2003 versus 2002  Amerens and UEs net other income increased $34 million and $20 million, respectively, in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of the expensing of economic development and energy assistance programs required by the UE Missouri electric rate case settlement in 2002 ($26 million). Amerens other income also increased in 2003 because of a decrease in the minority interest related to EEIs lower earnings in 2003. The increase in UEs other income was partially offset by a net decrease in earnings from UEs ownership interest in EEI and decreased gains on derivative contracts.  CIPS other income decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of a decline in intercompany interest income ($3 million) CIPS received on the Genco subordinated promissory note due to a lower outstanding principal balance. In addition, CIPS other income decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002, because of a decrease in contributions in aid of construction ($2 million).  Gencos, CILCORPs and CILCOs other income and deductions in 2003 were comparable to 2002.  IPs total other income increased $5 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, due to a gain recognized in 2003 related to an asset retirement obligation, along with reduced losses on disposal of property and a general reduction in nonoperating expenses.   41 Interest  2004 versus 2003  Interest expense for Ameren in 2004 was comparable to 2003. However, excluding the additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in the current year, interest expense decreased at Ameren by $20 million. The decrease was primarily due to the redemption of $150 million of Ameren floating rate notes at the end of 2003 and reduced short term borrowings, as well as redemptions of long term debt during 2004 and 2003 at its subsidiaries, as noted below.  Gencos interest expense was reduced $7 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily due to a reduction in principal amounts outstanding on intercompany promissory notes to CIPS and Ameren along with decreased borrowings from Amerens non state regulated subsidiary money pool. The balance of intercompany notes payable to CIPS and Ameren was $283 million at December 31, 2004, as compared to $411 million at December 31, 2003, and $462 million at December 31, 2002.  Interest expense decreased $1 million at CILCO in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of the redemption of long term debt of $119 million in 2004 and $100 million in 2003, partially offset by increased intercompany borrowings.  Interest expense was flat at CILCORP in 2004 as compared to 2003. Redemptions of debt at CILCO, noted above, and repurchases of an aggregate of $40 million of CILCORP debt in 2004 and 2003, respectively, were offset by increased intercompany borrowings.  Interest expense decreased $32 million at IP in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to redemptions and repurchases of indebtedness of $700 million in 2004 and $190 million in 2003, reductions in the notes payable to IP SPT, and purchase accounting amortization. See Note 5 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity and Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information.  Interest expense at UE and CIPS in 2004 was comparable to 2003.  2003 versus 2002  Interest expense increased $63 million at Ameren in 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily because the assumption of CILCORP debt added $48 million to interest expense. In addition, interest expense was higher in 2003 because Genco issued $275 million of 7.95% senior notes in June 2002 ($10 million).  Interest expense decreased $7 million at CIPS in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of the maturity or redemption of first mortgage bonds in the third quarter of 2002 ($2 million) and in the second quarter of 2003 ($5 million).  Interest expense increased $15 million at Genco in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of increased borrowings from Amerens non state regulated subsidiary money pool ($9 million), partially offset by a reduction in the principal amounts outstanding on subordinated intercompany promissory notes to CIPS and Ameren in May 2003 ($4 million). In addition, Gencos interest expense increased in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because $275 million of 7.95% senior notes were issued in June 2002.  Interest expense decreased $12 million at CILCORP and $5 million at CILCO in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of the redemption of long term debt, partially offset by expenses associated with debt redemption. In addition, CILCORP interest expense decreased $7 million from the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments that recorded CILCORPs debt at fair value.  Interest expense increased $51 million at IP in 2003 primarily because of the additional issuances of $150 million and $400 million 11.50% mortgage bonds in 2003 and 2002, respectively, partially offset by the reduction in IP SPT transitional funding trust notes, the redemption of IPs $100 million and $90 million mortgage bonds in August and September 2003, respectively, and the repayment of IPs $300 million term loan ($200 million repaid in December 2002 and $100 million repaid in May 2003).   UEs interest expense in 2003 was comparable to 2002.  Income Taxes  2004 versus 2003  Income tax expense was lower at Ameren in 2004 as compared with 2003, because of a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was lower primarily because of the recording in 2004 of the expected nontaxable federal Medicare Prescription Drug Subsidy and a tax benefit related to CILCOs settlement of a litigation claim.  Income tax expense increased at CIPS in 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily due to higher pretax income in 2004 and an Illinois tax settlement in the third quarter of 2003, which resulted in reduced income taxes in the prior year period. Income tax expense increased at Genco and IP in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of higher pretax income in 2004. Income tax expense decreased at UE primarily because of lower pretax income in 2004. The recording of the nontaxable federal Medicare Prescription Drug subsidy lowered taxable income at all the Ameren companies. Income tax expense decreased at CILCORP and CILCO primarily because of a tax benefit of $8 million as a result of CILCOs settlement of a litigation claim and lower  42 pretax income in 2004. See also Note 13 Income Taxes to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding effective tax rates.  2003 versus 2002  Income tax expense increased at Ameren, UE and Genco in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of higher pretax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate at Ameren. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to an Illinois tax settlement ($7 million) at CIPS in the third quarter of 2003. Income tax expense decreased at CILCO and IP primarily because of lower pretax income. CILCORPs income tax expense in 2003 was comparable to 2002.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The tariff based gross margins of Amerens rate regulated utility operating companies (UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP) continue to be the principal source of cash from operating activities for Ameren and its rate regulated subsidiaries. A diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate regulated residential, commercial and industrial classes and a commodity mix of gas and electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows. For cash flow, Genco principally relies on sales to an affiliate under a contract expiring at the end of 2006 and sales to other wholesale and industrial customers under long term contracts. In addition, we plan to use short term borrowings to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements.  The following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:   Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Ameren(a) $ 1,129 $ 1,022 $ 827 $ (1,266 ) $ (1,181 ) $ (803 ) $ 95 $ (358 ) $ 537 UE 749 633 692 (580 ) (503 ) (454 ) (136 ) (124 ) (244 ) CIPS 73 57 95 78 12 (7 ) (165 ) (70 ) (97 ) Genco 180 211 108 (50 ) (58 ) (442 ) (131 ) (154 ) 335 CILCORP(b) 136 70 88 (120 ) (95 ) (120 ) (20 ) 4 46 CILCO 137 103 109 (125 ) (86 ) (123 ) (18 ) (31 ) 24 IP(c) 247 128 218 (272 ) (126 ) (141 ) 13 (102 ) (1 )  (a) Excludes amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; excludes amounts for CILCORP prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non Registrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (b) Includes predecessor information for periods prior to January 2003. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (c) 2004 amounts include financial information prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; all amounts prior to September 30, 2004, represent predecessor information.  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  2004 versus 2003  Cash flows provided by operating activities increased for Ameren in 2004 as compared with the same period in 2003. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to incremental earnings from the acquisition of IP in the fourth quarter of 2004, lower cash taxes paid with the pension contribution, IP debt redemption premiums, and accelerated tax depreciation. Ameren and UE also received $36 million in 2004 as compared with $15 million in 2003, as a result of UEs settlement in 2003 of a dispute over mine reclamation issues with a coal supplier, which benefited cash flows from operating activities.  Cash flows from operating activities from all the Ameren Companies, except IP, were negatively affected in 2004 by a $295 million pension contribution made by Ameren (UE $186 million; CIPS $33 million; Genco $29 million; CILCORP and CILCO $41 million).  Cash flows provided by operating activities increased for CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of the increased earnings discussed under Results of Operations and less cash taxes paid. CILCORP and CILCO also benefited from net income tax refunds of $40 million and $20 million, respectively. IPs cash flows from operations benefited from the 2004 recovery of prepayments related to IP natural gas purchase contracts made in 2003. These benefits in 2004 were partially offset at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, and CILCO by the pension contribution. IPs cash flows from operations were negatively affected by the timing of IPs income tax reimbursements to Dynegy and the effect of the acquisition on tax payments to Dynegy. Deferred taxes at IP in 2004 benefited from debt redemption premiums and accelerated tax depreciation resulting from the acquisition.  Gencos cash flows provided by operating activities decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of the timing differences associated with income taxes and the increased pension contributions, partially offset by increased earnings. 43  2003 versus 2002  Cash flows provided by operating activities increased for Ameren and Genco and decreased for UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for Ameren and Genco was primarily a result of the increased net earnings discussed above under Results of Operations. Amerens increase in earnings in 2003 as compared with the same period in 2002 was partially attributable to 11 months of CILCORPs earnings in 2003 associated with the acquisition. Gencos cash flows from operating activities also increased with the receipt of a $76 million tax refund. The increase at Ameren was reduced by two noncash components of net earnings. One was associated with the gain of $18 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 143. The other was the $51 million pretax gain related to UEs settlement of the coal mine reclamation issues, of which only $15 million was received in cash during 2003.  Partially offsetting these benefits to cash flows from operating activities were increased materials and supplies inventories resulting from higher natural gas volumes put into storage and higher natural gas prices.  Cash provided by operating activities decreased for UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 as compared with 2002 primarily because of increased working capital requirements and timing differences. UEs decrease in cash flows from operating activities was attributable to increased tax payments and natural gas inventory increases, partially offset by lower operations and maintenance expenses and UEs settlement of the coal mine reclamation issues, of which $15 million was received in cash during 2003. CIPS decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to increased tax payments in 2003 as compared with 2002.  IPs cash flows provided by operating activities decreased in 2003 as compared with 2002 because of the increased earnings discussed above in Results of Operations and because of changes in working capital primarily related to timing differences in cash flows. Cash flows were positively affected in 2003 by the receipt of one additional month of interest income on IPs Note Receivable from Former Affiliate. See Note 14 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the Note Receivable from Affiliate. IPs decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was partially offset by higher priced natural gas inventories and higher prepayments due to increased collateral requirements on natural gas purchases.  Pension Funding  The Ameren Companies, excluding IP, and EEI made cash contributions totaling $295 million in 2004 and $27 million in 2003 to Amerens defined benefit retirement plan qualified trust. The cash contributions in 2004 and 2003 to Amerens defined benefit retirement plan qualified trusts will, among other things, provide cost savings because they will allow us to avoid paying a portion of the insurance premiums to the Pension Guarantee Trust Corporation and will mitigate future benefit cost increases. Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2004, we expect to be required under ERISA to fund an aggregate of $400 million for the period of 2005 to 2009 in order to maintain minimum funding levels for our pension plan; no minimum contribution will be required until 2008, assuming continuation of the current federal interest rate relief beyond 2005. We expect UEs, CIPS, Gencos, CILCOs and IPs portion of the future funding requirements to be approximately 50%, 9%, 9%, 11% and 21%, respectively. These amounts are estimates and may change with actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in government regulations, and any prior voluntary contributions. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  2004 versus 2003  Cash flows used in investing activities increased for Ameren, UE, CILCORP and CILCO and decreased for Genco in 2004 as compared with 2003. Included in Amerens cash flows used in investing activities was $443 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of IP and Dynegys 20% interest in EEI in 2004 and $479 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of CILCORP and Medina Valley in 2003. Excluding the cash paid for acquisitions in 2004 and 2003, Amerens cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of increased capital expenditures, discussed below, at UE, CILCORP, and CILCO, and the addition of IPs capital expenditures after the acquisition date.  CIPS cash flows provided by investing activities increased in 2004 as compared with 2003 principally because of increased cash receipts related to the intercompany note receivable from Genco. The note receivable from Genco was issued in conjunction with the transfer of CIPS generating assets and liabilities to Genco in 2000. See Note 14 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of the note receivable. CIPS cash flows provided by investing activities also increased due to decreased capital expenditures incurred in 2004 as compared with 2003.  Gencos cash flows used in investing activities decreased, principally because capital expenditures were lower in 2004 than in 2003.  IPs cash flows used in investing activities increased principally because of contributions made to the money pool in 2004.  44  2003 versus 2002  Cash flows used in investing activities increased for Ameren and UE and decreased for CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO in 2003 as compared with 2002. Amerens increase in cash used in investing activities in 2003 as compared with 2002 was primarily related to $479 million in net cash paid for the acquisitions of CILCORP and Medina Valley in early 2003 and capital expenditures for CILCORP in 2003. These increased investing activities in 2003 were partially offset by lower construction expenditures at other Ameren subsidiaries and lower nuclear fuel expenditures in 2003. The increase for UE in 2003 over the prior year period was primarily related to the 2002 receipt of $84 million UE had invested in the utility money pool, partially offset by lower construction and nuclear fuel expenditures in 2003. The decrease in 2003 cash flows used in investing activities from the prior year period for Genco was primarily related to lower construction expenditures as Genco completed construction of CTs in 2002. In addition, Genco paid $140 million in the first quarter of 2002 to Development Company for a CT purchased, but not yet paid for, at December 31, 2001. The decrease for CILCORP and CILCO was primarily due to lower construction expenditures related to the completed installation of pollution control equipment at their coal fired power plants. The increase in cash provided by investing activities for CIPS was primarily due to principal payments received on its intercompany note receivable from Genco.  Capital Expenditures  The following table presents the capital expenditures by the Ameren Companies for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002:  Capital Expenditures  2004  2003  2002 Ameren(a) $ 806 $ 682 $ 787 UE 524 480 520 CIPS 46 50 57 Genco 50 58 442 CILCORP(b) 125 87 124 CILCO 125 87 124 IP(c) 135 126 144 Other(d) 26 23 (232 ) (a) Excludes amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; excludes amounts for CILCORP prior to the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non Registrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (b) 2002 amounts represent predecessor information. 2003 amounts include January 2003 predecessor information of $16 million. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (c) 2003 and 2002 amounts represent predecessor information. 2004 includes amounts totaling $100 million incurred prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004. (d) Consists primarily of capital expenditures by Ameren Services and includes intercompany transactions between Development Company and Genco related to Gencos purchase of a CT in 2002. Amerens capital expenditures for 2004 principally related to various upgrades at UEs power plants, including the replacement of condenser bundles, low pressure rotor equipment and steam generators, and other upgrades completed during the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant. The replacement and upgrade work at UEs Callaway plant resulted in capital expenditures of $40 million in 2004. UE also incurred capital expenditures related to the installation of new CTs at its Venice plant and replacement of turbines at its Sioux and Rush Island power plants in 2004. In addition, UEs capital expenditures included environmental and other upgrades at UE power plants and expenditures incurred for new transmission and distribution lines. CILCORPs and CILCOs capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily related to power plant upgrades made at the Edwards and Duck Creek plants in order for CILCOs non rate regulated subsidiary, AERG, to have more flexibility in future fuel supply for power generation. Gencos use of cash in 2004 for capital expenditures was primarily attributed to the replacement of a turbine generator at its Coffeen power plant. Capital expenditures at IP consisted of numerous projects to upgrade and maintain the reliability of IPs electric and gas transmission and distribution systems and to add new customers to the system.  Amerens capital expenditures for 2003 principally related to various upgrades at UEs and Gencos coal fired power plants, NOx reduction equipment expenditures at CILCOs generating plants, replacements and improvements to the existing electric transmission and distribution system and natural gas distribution system, and construction costs for CTs at UE. In 2002, UE placed into service 240 megawatts of CT capacity (approximately $135 million). In addition, Genco placed into service 470 megawatts of CT capacity (approximately $215 million). Also in 2002, Genco paid approximately $140 million to Development Company for a CT purchased but accrued for in December 2001. In addition, selective catalytic reduction technology was added on two units at one of Gencos coal fired power plants at a cost of $42 million.  The following table estimates the capital expenditures that will be incurred by the Ameren Companies from 2005 through 2009, including construction expenditures, capitalized interest and allowance for funds used during construction (except for Genco which has no allowance for funds used during construction) and estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental standards:  2005 2006  2009 Total UE $ 520 $ 2,460  $ 3,480 $ 2,980  $ 4,000 CIPS 55 260  300 315  355 Genco 60 480  590 540  650 CILCO (T&D) 55 180  200 235  255 CILCO(a) 80 170  220 250  300 IP 140 485  530 625  670 Other(b) 20 35  50 55  70 Total Ameren $ 930 $ 4,070  $ 5,370 $ 5,000  $ 6,300 (a) AERG capital expenditures related to CILCOs non rate regulated generating business. (b) Includes amounts for non Registrant Ameren subsidiaries.  45  UEs estimated capital expenditures include the replacement of steam generators at UEs Callaway nuclear plant, estimated at $70 million, and transmission, distribution and other generation related activities, as well as for compliance with new NOx control regulations discussed below. Also included in the estimate is the addition of new CTs with approximately 330 megawatts of capacity at UEs Venice, Illinois power plant site by the end of 2005. Total costs expected to be incurred for these units at the Venice power plant are $125 million.  UE committed to make between $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion of infrastructure investments during the period January 1, 2002, to June 30, 2006, as part of UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement, including the addition of 700 megawatts of generation capacity. The new capacity requirement is expected to be satisfied by the addition of 240 megawatts in 2002 and the proposed transfer from Genco to UE, at net book value (approximately $240 million), of approximately 550 megawatts of CTs at Pinckneyville and Kinmundy, Illinois. As of December 31, 2004, UE had expended $1.5 billion toward the 2002 rate case settlement. In addition, commitments totaling at least $15 million for gas infrastructure improvements between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2006, were agreed upon as part of UEs 2003 Missouri gas rate case settlement See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of these regulatory proceedings.   CIPS and CILCOs estimated capital expenditures are primarily for transmission and distribution related activities. Gencos estimated capital expenditures are primarily for upgrades to existing coal and gas fired generating facilities and other generation related activities. CILCOs estimate also includes capital expenditures for generation related activities, as well as for compliance with new NOx control regulations at AERGs generating facilities.  IPs estimated capital expenditures include energy infrastructure improvements of $275 million to $325 million through 2006. This commitment was made to the ICC by Ameren in conjunction with the acquisition of IP. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further explanation of IPs infrastructure commitment.  We continually review our generation port folio and expected power needs. As a result, we could modify our plan for generation capacity, which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and whether capacity may be purchased, among other things. Any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material.  Environmental Capital Expenditures  Both federal and state laws require significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions that result from burning fossil fuels. The Clean Air Act and NOx Budget Trading Program created marketable commodities called allowances. Each allowance gives the owner the right to emit one ton of SO2 or NOx. All existing generating facilities have been allocated allowances that are based on past production and the statutory emission reduction goals. If additional allowances are needed for new generating facilities, they can be purchased from facilities that have excess allowances or from allowance banks. Our generating facilities comply with the SO2 limits through the use and purchase of allowances, the use of low sulfur fuels, and through the application of pollution control technology. The NOx Budget Trading Program limits emissions of NOx during the ozone season (May through September). The NOx Budget Trading Program applies to all electric generating units in Illinois beginning in 2004; it applies to the eastern third of Missouri, where UEs coal fired power plants are located, beginning in 2007. Our generating facilities are expected to comply with the NOx limits through the use and purchase of allowances or through the application of pollution control technology, including low NOx burners, over fire air systems, combustion optimization, and selective catalytic reduction systems.  As of December 31, 2004, UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI held 1.6 million, 0.4 million, 0.2 million, and 0.3 million tons, respectively, of SO2 emission allowances with vintages from 2004 to 2012. Each company possesses additional allowances for use in periods beyond 2012. As of December 31, 2004, UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI Illinois facilities held 290 tons, 22,400 tons, 6,300 tons and 8,600 tons, respectively, of NOX emission allowances with vintages from 2004 to 2007. The Illinois EPA is still determining some NOx emission allowance allocations for this period and 2008. UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI expect to use a substantial portion of the SO2 and NOx allowances for ongoing operations. Allocations of NOx allowances for Missouri facilities will be made when rules are finalized by Missouri regulators. New environmental regulations, including the Clean Air Interstate Rule as discussed below, the timing of the installation of pollution control equipment, and the level of operations will have a significant impact on the amount of allowances actually required for ongoing operations.   In mid December 2003, the EPA issued proposed regulations with respect to SO2 and NOx emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants. The new rules, if adopted, will require significant additional reductions in these emissions from UE, Genco and CILCO power plants in phases, beginning in 2010. The rules are currently under a public review and comment period and may change before being issued as final. We do not expect regulations to be finalized until the first half of 2005. The  46  following table presents preliminary estimated capital costs based on current technology for the Ameren systems to comply with the Clean Air Interstate Rule and mercury rules, as proposed. The timing of estimated capital costs between periods at UE will be influenced by whether excess emission credits are used to comply with the proposed rules, thereby deferring capital investment. Amounts for 2005 and 2006 to 2009 are included in our estimated capital expenditures table above.  2005 2006 2009 2010 2015 Total Ameren  $ 50  $ 510 $ 1,360 $ 355 $ 1,130  $ 1,400 $ 1,900 UE   20  160 880 175 880  840 1,140 Genco  10  250 340 140 200  400 550 CILCO  20  100 140 40 50  160 210  See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of environmental matters.   Cash Flows from Financing Activities  2004 versus 2003  Cash flows from financing activities increased for Ameren in 2004 as compared with 2003 principally because more proceeds were received from the issuance of common stock, short term debt, and long term debt; it totaled $2.2 billion in 2004 as compared with $1.1 billion in 2003. Proceeds of $1.3 billion received from the issuance of common stock in February 2004 and July 2004 were used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of IP and Dynegys 20% interest in EEI and to reduce high cost IP debt assumed as part of the transaction and to pay related premiums. Proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in 2003 and 2002 were principally used by Ameren for the acquisition of CILCORP in January 2003. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. Proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in 2004 were temporarily used to repay a $100 million term loan at CILCO and to repay short term debt totaling $181 million pending their use for the acquisition and recapitalization of IP. A portion of the short term debt was also used to temporarily fund UEs maturity of long term debt totaling $85 million in December 2004.  Amerens increase in cash flows from financing activities was partially offset by increased redemptions, repurchases and maturities of short term debt, long term debt, and preferred stock, and by the nuclear fuel lease termination payment totaling $1.5 billion in 2004 as compared with $1.0 billion in 2003. The issuance of additional common shares and long term debt cost Ameren an incremental $26 million in capital issuance costs in 2004 as compared with 2003. Ameren also paid an additional $69 million in common dividends because more common shares were outstanding in 2004 than in 2003.  UEs cash flows used in financing activities increased in 2004 as compared with 2003. In 2004, cash provided by borrowings from the utility money pool, short term debt, and long term debt issuances totaling $631 million were used for the redemption and refinancing of long term debt. In January 2004, UE made a $67 million payment in order to terminate its nuclear fuel lease arrangement. Also contributing to UEs increase in cash used in financing activities were higher incremental dividend payments made to Ameren in 2004 than in 2003.  CIPS cash flows used in financing activities increased in 2004 compared with 2003, principally because of $53 million of repayments to the utility money pool arrangement in 2004, compared with $121 million of borrowings from the money pool arrangement in 2003. Increased dividend payments of $13 million to Ameren in 2004 as compared with 2003 contributed to CIPS increase in cash used in financing activities. Proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt in 2004, along with decreased redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long term debt and preferred stock in 2004 as compared with 2003 partially offset CIPS increase in cash used in financing activities in 2004.  Gencos cash flows used in financing activities decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of a capital contribution of $75 million received indirectly from Ameren in 2004. The capital contribution received by Genco in 2004 was used for Gencos prepayment of $75 million of the principal amount outstanding under its intercompany note payable to CIPS. The contribution and cash flows from operations allowed Genco to reduce money pool borrowings in 2004 as compared with 2003. Genco had increased dividend payments in 2004 as compared with 2003.  As of December 31, 2004, Genco had affiliate notes payables of $249 million and $34 million to CIPS and Ameren, respectively, which by their current terms have final payments of principal and interest due on May 1, 2005. The note payable to CIPS was issued in conjunction with the transfer of its electric generating assets and related liabilities to Genco. Genco and CIPS expect to renew or modify the CIPS note to extend the principal maturity, which is expected to include continued amortization of the principal amount. Genco and Ameren are currently evaluating various alternatives with respect to the note payable to Ameren. In the event that the maturities of these notes are not extended or restructured, Genco may need to access other financing sources to meet the maturity obligation to the extent it does not have cash available from its operating cash flows. Such sources of financing could include borrowings under the non state regulated subsidiary money pool, or infusion of equity capital,   47  or new direct borrowings from Ameren, all subject to applicable regulatory financing authorizations and provisions in Gencos senior note indenture.  CILCORPs cash flows from financing activities decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003, because of lower borrowings. CILCORPs borrowings from the utility money pool arrangement and direct intercompany borrowings from Ameren totaled $47 million in 2004 as compared with $195 million in 2003. A capital contribution from Ameren of $75 million and increased cash flows from operations allowed CILCORP to reduce borrowings from the utility money pool. Borrowings from the utility money pool in the first quarter of 2004 were the source of funds for the repayment of CILCOs $100 million secured bank term loan facility. Proceeds from the issuance of long term debt were used to redeem a portion of CILCOs long term debt in 2004.  CILCOs cash flows used in financing activities decreased in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because of reduced dividend contributions made to CILCORP in 2004 as compared with 2003, and a $75 million capital contribution received indirectly from Ameren in 2004. CILCOs increase in cash flows from financing activities was partially offset by reduced borrowings from the utility money pool arrangement in 2004 as compared with 2003.  Cash flows from financing activities increased modestly for IP in 2004 as compared with 2003. Capital contributions of $871 million received from Ameren in the fourth quarter of 2004 were used to redeem and repurchase long term debt of $700 million and to pay related premiums of $103 million; that compares with $376 million in redemptions of short term debt and long term debt in 2003. In 2003, proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and prepaid interest received from an affiliate, which totaled $278 million, were used to redeem short term and long term debt.  2003 versus 2002  Cash flows from financing activities decreased for Ameren, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO and increased for UE and CIPS in 2003 as compared with 2002. The decrease in cash flows from financing activities for Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO was primarily due to an increase in redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long term debt. The decrease in cash flows from financing activities for Ameren was also due to the termination payment on the UE nuclear fuel lease and the incremental payment of dividends on common stock by Ameren due to increased shares outstanding. In addition, Ameren had decreased proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and common stock, which totaled $1.1 billion in 2003 as compared with $1.6 billion in 2002. Proceeds from the sale of common shares by Ameren in 2003 and 2002 were primarily used to fund the acquisition of CILCORP, which was completed in January 2003. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail. Gencos decrease in cash flows from financing activities resulted from decreased borrowings from the non state regulated subsidiary money pool, as well as no issuances of long term debt in 2003. The decreases in cash flows from financing activities at CILCORP and CILCO were partially offset by proceeds received from intercompany borrowing arrangements by CILCORP and CILCO in 2003.  Cash flows from financing activities increased at UE in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of additional proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt offset by increased redemptions of debt in 2003 as compared with 2002. Cash flows used in financing activities decreased at CIPS in 2003 as compared with 2002, primarily because of increased proceeds from borrowings from the utility money pool, offset by increased long term debt payments.  Cash flows from financing activities decreased at IP in 2003 as compared to 2002, principally due to less proceeds received from the issuances of short term debt and long term debt totaling $150 million in 2003 as compared with $460 million received in 2002. The proceeds received from these issuances in 2003 and 2002, along with the prepaid interest received from an affiliate totaling $128 million in 2003, and cash flows from operating activities was used to redeem short term debt and long term debt totaling $376 million in 2003 as compared with $420 million in 2002. Decreased redemptions of debt partially offset IPs decrease in cash flows from debt issuances in 2003 as compared with 2002.  Short term Borrowings and Liquidity  Short term borrowings typically consist of commercial paper issuances and drawings under committed bank credit facilities with maturities generally from 1 to 45 days. See Note 5 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.  The following table presents the various committed bank credit facilities of certain of the Ameren Companies and EEI as of December 31, 2004:  Credit Facility Expiration Amount Committed Amount Available Ameren:(a) Multiyear revolving July 2006  $ 235  $ 89 Multiyear revolving July 2007  350  350 Multiyear revolving July 2009  350  350 48 Credit Facility Expiration Amount Committed Amount Available UE: Various 364 day revolving through July 2005  154  CIPS: Two 364 day revolving through July 2005  15  CILCO: Three 364 day revolving through August 2005  60  EEI: Two bank credit facilities through June 2005  45  7 Total  $ 1,209  $ 796 (a) Ameren Companies may access these credit facilities through intercompany borrowing arrangements.  At December 31, 2004, certain of the Ameren Companies had committed bank credit facilities totaling $1,164 million, $789 million of which was available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short term borrowing authorizations, by UE, CIPS, CILCO, IP and Ameren Services through a utility money pool agreement. At December 31, 2004, UE had $375 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, which reduced the available amounts under these facilities. All of the $789 million was available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short term borrowing authorizations, by Ameren directly, by CILCORP through direct short term borrowings from Ameren, and by most of the non rate regulated subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Resources Company, Genco, Marketing Company, AFS, AERG and Ameren Energy, through a non state regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to coordinate and provide for certain short term cash and working capital requirements. Separate money pools are maintained for rate regulated and non rate regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services enables IP to make short term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money agreement, together with any outstanding external short term borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500 million pursuant to authorizations from the ICC and the SEC under the PUHCA. Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the agreements. See Note 14 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement. The committed bank credit facilities are used to support our commercial paper programs under which $375 million was outstanding for Ameren on a consolidated basis at December 31, 2004 ($150 million in 2003). Access to our credit facilities for all Ameren Companies is subject to reduction based on use by affiliates.  The following table summarizes the expiration of amounts available under bank credit facilities that were committed at December 31, 2004:  Total Committed Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than 5 Years Ameren $ 935 $ $ 585 $ 350 $ UE 154 154 CIPS 15 15 CILCO 60 60 EEI 45 45 Total $ 1,209 $ 274 $ 585 $ 350 $  In addition to committed credit facilities, a further source of liquidity for Ameren from time to time is available cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2004, Ameren had $69 million of cash and cash equivalents.  Ameren and UE are authorized by the SEC under PUHCA to have an aggregate of up to of $1.5 billion and $1 billion, respectively, of short term unsecured debt instruments outstanding at any time. In addition, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO have PUHCA authority to have an aggregate of up to $250 million each of short term unsecured debt instruments outstanding at any time. Genco is authorized by the FERC to have up to $300 million of short term debt outstanding at any time.  We rely on access to short term and long term capital markets as a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows. Our inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively impact our ability to maintain and grow our businesses. After assessing our current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets. Such events might cause our cost of capital to increase or our ability to access the capital markets to be adversely affected. 49 Long term Debt and Equity  The following table presents the issuances of common stock and the issuances, redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt and preferred stock (including any redemption premiums) for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002 for the Ameren Companies, Medina Valley and EEI. For additional information related to the terms and uses of these issuances and the sources of funds and terms for the redemptions, see Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

(c) Amounts for CILCORP prior to January 31, 2003, and IP prior to September 30, 2004, have not been included in the total long term debt and preferred stock redemption and repurchases at Ameren.   51  The following table presents the authorized amounts under Form S 3 shelf registration statements filed and declared effective for certain of the Ameren Companies as of January 31, 2005:   Authorized Date Authorized Amount Issued Available Ameren(a) June 2004 $ 2,000 $ 459 $ 1,541 UE(b) September 2003 1,000 689 311 CIPS May 2001 250 150 100 (a) Ameren issued securities totaling $875 million under the August 2002 shelf registration statement and $459 million under the September 2003 shelf registration statement. (b) UE issued securities totaling $200 million in 2003, $404 million in 2004 and $85 million in January 2005.  In March 2004, the SEC declared effective a Form S 3 registration statement filed by Ameren in February 2004, authorizing the offering of 6 million additional shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at Amerens option, newly issued shares or treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Ameren is also currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under certain of its 401(k) plans pursuant to effective SEC Form S 8 registration statements. Under DRPlus and our 401(k) plans, Ameren issued 2.3 million shares of common stock in 2004 valued at $107 million. Under DRPlus and our 401(k) plans, Ameren issued 2.5 million and 2.3 million shares of common stock in 2003 and 2002, respectively, that were valued at $105 million and $93 million for the respective years.  Ameren, UE and CIPS may sell all or a portion of the remaining securities registered under the open registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant such a sale. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder.  Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants  See Note 5 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the covenants and provisions contained in certain of the Ameren Companies bank credit facilities. Also see Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions contained in certain of the Ameren Companies indenture agreements and articles of incorporation. Dividends  Common Dividends  Ameren paid common stock dividends to its shareholders totaling $479 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2004, $410 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2003, and $376 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2002. This resulted in a payout rate based on net income of 90%, 78% and 98% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Dividends paid to common shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the same periods were 42%, 40% and 44%, respectively.  The amount and timing of dividends payable on Amerens common stock are within the sole discretion of Amerens board of directors. The board of directors has so far not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends. However, the board considers various issues including Amerens historic earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, cash flow and potential cash flow requirements, dividend payout rates at other utilities, return on investments with similar risk characteristics and overall business considerations. On February 11, 2005, Amerens board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 63.5 cents per share payable on March 31, 2005, to shareholders of record on March 9, 2005.  Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the Ameren Companies payment of dividends. Ameren would experience restrictions on dividend payments if it were to defer contract adjustment payments on its equity security units. UE would experience restrictions on dividend payments if it were to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures. CIPS has provisions restricting its dividend payments based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Gencos indenture includes restrictions that prohibit making any dividend payments if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold. CILCORP has restrictions if leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met or if CILCORPs senior long term debt does not have specified ratings as described in its indenture. CILCO has restrictions on dividend payments relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock and amounts to be set aside for any sinking fund retirement of its 5.85% Series preferred stock. At December 31, 2004, none of the conditions described above that would restrict the payment of dividends existed. In its approval of the acquisition of IP by Ameren, the ICC issued an order that provides for the ability of IP to pay dividends on its common stock subject to certain conditions related to credit ratings of IP and Ameren and the elimination of IPs 11.5% mortgage bonds. Given the current credit ratings of IP and the amount of IPs 11.5% mortgage bonds that remain outstanding, IPs payment of dividends on its common stock is restricted to $80 million in 2005 and $160 million cumulatively through 2006. In addition, in accordance with the order issued by the ICC, IP will establish a dividend policy comparable to the dividend policy of Amerens other Illinois utilities and consistent with achieving and maintaining a common equity to total capitalization ratio between 50% and 60%.   52  The following table presents dividends paid by Ameren Corporation and by Amerens subsidiaries to their respective parents and also includes amounts retained by Ameren Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002:  2004 2003 2002 UE $ 315 $ 288 $ 299 CIPS 75 62 62 Genco 66 36 21 CILCORP(a) 18 27 IP(b) (b ) (b ) Ameren (parent) (3 ) (7 ) Non Registrants 5 1 Dividends paid by Ameren $ 479 $ 410 $ 376 (a) Prior to February 2003, CILCORPs dividends would have been paid to AES. These amounts are excluded from the total dividends paid to Ameren. CILCO paid dividends of $10 million, $62 million, and $40 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. (b) Prior to October 2004, the ICC prohibited IP from paying dividends. If permitted to be paid, IPs dividends would have been paid directly to Illinova or indirectly to Dynegy.  Preferred Dividends  Certain of the Ameren Companies have issued preferred stock on which they are obliged to make preferred dividend payments. Each company board of directors declares the preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which it is payable and the amount that will be paid. See Note 10 Stockholder Rights Plan and Preferred Stock to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred stock issuances.  Contractual Obligations  The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding Amerens, UEs and IPs capital expenditure commitments, related to UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement, UEs 2003 Missouri gas rate case settlement, and Amerens acquisition of IP.

(c) The weighted average variable rate debt has been calculated using the interest rate as of December 31, 2004. (d) Amounts related to certain real estate leases and railroad licenses have indefinite payment periods. The $1 million annual obligation for these items is included in the Less than 1 year, 1 3 Years, and 4 5 Years columns. Amounts for More than 5 Years are not included in the total amount due to the indefinite periods. (e) Represents purchase contracts for coal, gas, nuclear fuel and electric capacity. Also represents a decommissioning liability at IP. (f) Routine short term purchase order commitments are not included.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  At December 31, 2004, none of the Ameren Companies had any off balance sheet financing arrangements, other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future.  Credit Ratings  The following table presents the principal credit ratings by Moodys, S&P and Fitch as of December 31, 2004:  Moodys S&P Fitch Ameren: Issuer/corporate credit rating A3 A N/A Unsecured debt A3 BBB+ A Commercial paper P 2 A 2 F2 UE: Secured debt A1 A A+ Commercial paper P 1 A 2 F1 CIPS: Secured debt A1 A A Genco: Unsecured debt A3/Baa2 A BBB+ CILCORP: Unsecured debt Baa2 BBB+ BBB+ CILCO: Secured debt A2 A A IP: Secured debt Baa3 A BBB  On July 8, 2004, Moodys confirmed Amerens A3 senior unsecured debt and bank loan ratings along with its A3 issuer rating. Moodys outlook for these ratings is stable. This rating action concluded Moodys review of Amerens long term ratings that was initiated on February 4, 2004, in connection with Amerens agreement to purchase IP from Dynegy. Amerens Prime 2 rating for short term debt, including commercial paper, was not under review, and was affirmed.  On July 30, 2004, S&P affirmed its A long term corporate credit ratings on Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO and removed the ratings from CreditWatch with negative implications. The A 2 short term credit ratings for Ameren and UE were not on CreditWatch. The outlook is negative for the long term ratings.  On October 1, 2004, S&P raised its corporate credit rating and senior secured debt rating on IP from B to A as a result of the completed acquisition of IP by Ameren. At the same time, S&P removed the rating from CreditWatch with positive implications and assigned a negative outlook to the rating. Also on this date, Moodys upgraded the senior secured debt rating of IP from Ba3 to Baa3 also as a result of the closing of the acquisition. Moodys has a stable outlook assigned to this rating. These new ratings assigned to IP by S&P and Moodys are investment grade.   54  Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital and or increase the cost of borrowings, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. At December 31, 2004, if the Ameren Companies were to receive a sub investment grade rating (less than BBB or Baa3), Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP could have been required to post collateral for certain trade obligations amounting to $76 million, $27 million, $ , $4 million, $2 million, $2 million, and $25 million, respectively. In addition, the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can increase or decrease based on credit ratings. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities; and it should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.  OUTLOOK   We expect the following industrywide trends and Ameren specific issues to affect earnings in 2005 and beyond:  Ameren, CILCORP, CILCO and IP expect to continue to focus on realizing integration synergies associated with these acquisitions, including lower fuel costs at CILCORP and CILCO and reduced administrative and operating expenses at IP. We expect continued economic growth in our service territory to benefit electric demand in 2005. In 2005, we expect natural gas and coal prices to support power prices similar to 2004 levels. Power prices in the Midwest affect the amount of revenues UE, Genco and AERG can generate by marketing any excess power into the interchange markets. Power prices in the Midwest also influence the cost of power we purchase in the interchange markets. Amerens coal and related transportation costs rose in 2004 and are expected to rise 3% to 4% in 2005 and again in 2006, and to increase further beyond 2006. Due to recent or future regulatory proceedings, there could be changes to the agreement between UE and Genco to dispatch electric generation jointly. Any change would likely result in a transfer of electric margins between Genco and UE and could ultimately affect the pricing of electric transfers between Genco and UE. Amerens earnings could be affected if and when electric rates for UE are adjusted by the MoPSC to reflect any such transfers, amendments to the joint disptach agreement and other changes in costs of providing electric service. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 14 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a more detailed description of the joint dispatch agreement and potential impacts. UE is currently seeking approval from the MoPSC to add Noranda Aluminum to its service territory. This customers load requirements represent approximately 5% of UEs current load. UE is also seeking to transfer its Illinois service territory to CIPS. Genco and UE are seeking to transfer 550 megawatts of CTs from Genco to UE. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. UEs Callaway nuclear plant will have a refueling and maintenance outage in the fall of 2005, which is expected to last 70 to 75 days. During this outage, major capital equipment will be replaced, which means that the outage will last longer than a typical refueling outage, which usually lasts 30 to 35 days and occurs approximately every 18 months. The delivery of some major equipment for this outage is dependent on adequate water levels in the Missouri River. Any delays or damage during shipment could result in additional costs and deferral of the project. During a refueling outage, maintenance and purchased power costs increase, so the amount of excess power available for sale decreases versus non outage years. Over the next few years, we expect increased expenses for rising employee benefit costs as well as higher insurance and security costs associated with additional measures we have taken, or may have to take, at UEs Callaway nuclear plant and our other operating plants. We are currently undertaking cost reduction or control initiatives associated with the strategic sourcing of purchases and streamlining of administrative functions. UE, Genco and CILCO are also seeking to raise the equivalent availability and capacity factors of power plants from our 2004 levels. Electric rates for Amerens operating subsidiaries have been fixed or declining for periods ranging from 12 years to 22 years. In 2006, electric rate adjustment moratoriums and intercompany power supply contracts expire in Amerens regulatory jurisdictions. Approximately 8 million megawatthours supplied annually by Genco and 6 million megawatthours supplied annually by AERG have been subject to contracts to provide CIPS and CILCO, through AERG, with power. The prices in these power supply contracts of $34.00 per megawatthour for AERG and $38.50 per megawatthour for Genco were below estimated market prices for similar contracts in February 2005. CIPS, CILCO and IP made a filing with the ICC, in February 2005, outlining, among other things, a proposed framework for generation procurement after 2006. In 2005, Ameren will also begin the process of preparing utility cost of service studies for filing in Illinois and Missouri in late 2005 or early 2006 to determine rates for UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. Based on current assumptions, Ameren expects the average rates for its Illinois utilities, in a combined basis, may increase by 10% to 20% in 2007 over present bundled rate levels, with 50% to 70% of this increase resulting from higher power costs. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. 55 The EPA has proposed more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants. Between 2005 and 2015, Ameren expects that certain of the Ameren Companies will be required to invest between $1.4 and $1.9 billion to retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment. These investments will also result in higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately two thirds of this investment will be in Amerens regulated Missouri operations and therefore is expected to be recoverable over time from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts expended in non rate regulated operations will depend on the adjustment of market prices for power as a result of this increased investment. The outcome and developments related to the above items could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, and opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase Amerens shareholder value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed. The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.   REGULATORY MATTERS  See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.  ACCOUNTING MATTERS  Critical Accounting Policies  Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. Our application of these policies involves judgments regarding many factors which, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. In the table below, we have outlined the critical accounting policies that we believe are most difficult, subjective or complex. A future change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results.  Accounting Policy Uncertainties Affecting Application Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery All of the Ameren Companies, except Genco, defer costs as regulatory assets in accordance with SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and make investments that they assume will be collected in future rates. Regulatory environment, external regulatory decisions and requirements Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact Impact of deregulation, rate freezes, and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs  Basis for Judgment We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. If facts and circumstances led us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset was probably no longer capable of being recovered, we would record a charge to earnings, which could be material. Environmental Costs We accrue for all known environmental contamination where remediation can be reasonably estimated, but some of our operations have existed for over 100 years and previous contamination may be unknown to us. Extent of contamination Responsible party determination Approved methods for cleanup Present and future legislation and governmental regulations and standards Results of ongoing research and development regarding environmental impacts  Basis for Judgment We determine the proper amounts to accrue for known environmental contamination by using internal and third party estimates of cleanup costs in the context of current remediation standards and available technology. 56 Accounting Policy Uncertainties Affecting Application Unbilled Revenue At the end of each period, we estimate, based on expected usage, the amount of revenue to record for services that have been provided to customers, but not billed. Projecting customer energy usage Estimating impacts of weather and other usage affecting factors for the unbilled period Estimating loss of energy during the process of transmission and delivery  Basis for Judgment We base our determination of the proper amount of unbilled revenue to accrue each period on the volume of energy delivered as valued by a model of billing cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class for our service area, as adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and weather variations based on historical results. Valuation of Goodwill, Long Lived Assets and Asset Retirement Obligations We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and long lived assets to determine whether they are impaired. We also review for the existence of asset retirement obligations. If an asset retirement obligation is identified, we determine the fair value of the obligation and subsequently reassess and adjust the obligation, as necessary. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Managements identification of impairment indicators Changes in business, industry, technology, or economic and market conditions Valuation assumptions and conclusions Estimated useful lives of our significant long lived assets Actions or assessments by our regulators Identification of an asset retirement obligation  Basis for Judgment Annually, or whenever events indicate a valuation may have changed, we use internal models and third parties to determine fair values. We use various methods to determine valuations, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples, and discounted, undiscounted, and probabilistic discounted cash flow models with multiple scenarios. The identification of asset retirement obligations is conducted through the review of legal documents and interviews.  Benefit Plan Accounting Based on actuarial calculations, we accrue costs of providing future employee benefits in accordance with SFAS Nos. 87, 106 and 112, which provide guidance on benefit plan accounting. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations Health care cost trend rates Timing of employee retirements and mortality assumptions  Basis for Judgment We use a third party consultant to assist us in evaluating and recording the proper amount for future employee benefits. Our ultimate selection of the discount rate, health care trend rate, and expected rate of return on pension assets is based on our review of available current, historical and projected rates, as applicable.  Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES  Our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Nonretail electric rates are regulated by the FERC. Our Missouri electric and gas rates were set through June 30, 2006, as part of the settlement of our Missouri electric and gas rate cases. Our Illinois electric rates are legislatively fixed through January 1, 2007. Even without these moratoriums on rate changes, adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that primarily reviews a historical period. As a result, revenue increases will lag changing prices. Inflation affects our operations, earnings, stockholders equity, and financial performance.  The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers. As a result, cash flows designed  57 to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years. The generation portion of our business in the Illinois jurisdiction is principally non rate regulated and therefore does not have regulated recovery mechanisms.  In our retail electric utility jurisdictions, there are no provisions for adjusting rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of purchased power. In our retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. UE, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent they must purchase natural gas to run CTs. They have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins to minimize the impact to the financial statements. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, of this report for further information.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  Market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument, derivative or non derivative, caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates. The following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. We handle market risks in accordance with established policies, which may include entering into various derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks, principally business, legal and operational risks, are not represented in the following discussion.  Our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets within prudent risk parameters. Our risk management policies are set by a Risk Management Steering Committee, which comprises senior level Ameren officers.  Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with:  long term and short term variable rate debt; fixed rate debt; commercial paper; and auction rate long term debt.  We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we hold within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates.  The following table presents the estimated increase (decrease) in our annual interest expense and net income if interest rates were to increase by 1% on variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2004:   Interest Expense Net Income(a) Ameren $ 13 $ (9 ) UE 8 (5 ) CIPS 1 (1 ) Genco 2 (1 ) CILCORP 3 (2 ) CILCO 2 (1 ) IP 4 (2 ) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 35%.  The model does not consider the effects of the reduced level of potential overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would probably take actions to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.  Credit Risk  Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted. NYMEX traded futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the NYMEX and have nominal credit risk. On all other transactions, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction.  Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables, executory contracts with market risk exposures, and leverage lease investments. The risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base. At December 31, 2004, no nonaffiliated customer represented greater than 10%, in the aggregate, of our accounts receivable. Our revenues are primarily derived from sales of electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and Illinois. UE, Genco and Marketing Company have credit exposure associated with accounts receivables from non affiliated companies for interchange sales. At December 31, 2004, UEs, Gencos and Marketing Companys combined credit exposure to non investment grade counterparties related to interchange sales was $2 million, net of collateral (2003 $4 million). We establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program that involves daily exposure reporting to senior management, master trading and netting agreements, and credit support, such as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze each counterpartys financial condition prior to entering into sales, forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts, and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged leases. We are currently 58  evaluating our credit exposure associated with the expected implementation of the MISO Day Two on April 1, 2005, but we are unable to predict at this time what impact it will have, if any.  Equity Price Risk  Our costs of providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, the rate of increase in health care costs and contributions made to the plans. The market value of our plan assets was affected by declines in the equity market in 2000 through 2002 for the pension and postretirement plans. As a result, at December 31, 2002, we recognized an additional minimum pension liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which resulted in an after tax charge to OCI and a reduction in stockholders equity of $102 million. In 2004, an after tax charge to the minimum pension liability was increased, resulting in OCI of $6 million, offsetting the $46 million of OCI in 2003 from a reduction in the minimum pension liability and an increase in stockholders equity. The following table presents the minimum pension liability amounts, after taxes, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:  2004 2003 Ameren(a) $ 62 $ 56 UE 36 34 CIPS 8 7 Genco 4 4 CILCORP(b) CILCO 17 13 IP(c) 10 (a) Excludes amounts for IP prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004, and includes amounts for Ameren Registrant and non Registrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (b) CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (c) Represents predecessor information in 2003.  The amount of the pension liability as of December 31, 2004, was the result of asset returns, interest rates, and our contributions to the plans during 2004. In future years, the liability recorded, the costs reflected in net income, or OCI, or cash contributions to the plans could increase materially without a recovery in equity markets in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 8.5%. If the fair value of the plan assets were to grow and exceed the accumulated benefit obligations in the future, then the recorded liability would be reduced and a corresponding amount of equity would be restored, net of taxes.  UE also maintains trust funds, as required by the NRC and Missouri and Illinois state laws, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning. As of December 31, 2004, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities (67%), debt securities (29%), and cash and cash equivalents (4%) and totaled $235 million at fair value (2003 $212 million). By maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize the returns to be utilized to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk. However, the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the fixed rate, fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trusts to various investment options. UEs exposure to equity price market risk is, in large part, mitigated, due to the fact that UE is currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in its electric rates, which would include unfavorable investment results.  Commodity Price Risk  We are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, and natural gas to the extent they cannot be recovered through rates. We pursue a philosophy of mitigating financial risks through structured risk management programs and policies, structured forward hedging programs as well as derivative financial instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts and financial swap contracts are used). A derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value of some underlying asset.  Amerens generation position is partially hedged through regulated and unregulated sales to electric customers. The regulated sales are subject to rate approval mechanisms. UE has an electric rate freeze in place in Missouri through June 30, 2006. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP have electric rate freezes in place in Illinois through January 1, 2007.  IP has contracts to purchase power that expire at the end of 2006. Should power acquired under these agreements be insufficient to meet IPs load requirements, IP will be required to buy power at market prices. Some purchased power agreements oblige the suppliers to provide power up to the reservation amount, and at the same prices, even if individual units are unavailable at various times. Purchased power agreements with other suppliers do not oblige them to acquire replacement power for us in the event of a curtailment or shutdown of their plants. Any costs not covered by rates could not be passed on to ratepayers, which could have an unfavorable impact on IPs results of operations.  With regard to our exposure to commodity price risk for purchased power and market based electricity sales, Ameren has two subsidiaries, Ameren Energy and Marketing Company, whose primary responsibilities include managing market risks associated with changing market prices for electricity purchased and sold on behalf of UE, Genco and CILCO. Purchases are generally transacted when they are economically beneficial to serve load requirements. In addition, Genco and CILCO have sold nearly all of their available non rate regulated peak generation capacity for the  59 summers of 2005 and 2006 at various prices, most of which are fixed.  Similar techniques are used to manage risks associated with fuel exposures for generation. Most UE, Genco and CILCO fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts. Since UE, Genco and CILCO do not have a provision similar to the PGA clause for electric operations, UE, Genco and CILCO have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and nuclear fuel in order to manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal hedging strategy is intended to produce reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility. Price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures, whereby the amount of coal purchased will be determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year. We will generally purchase coal up to five years out, but we may purchase coal beyond five years based on favorable market conditions or deal structure. Conversely, the strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions.  Transportation costs to deliver coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs. We typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and mitigate transportation price volatility. The natural gas transportation expenses for the distribution companies and the gas fired generation units are controlled by the FERC via published tariffs with rights to extend the contracts from year to year. Depending on our competitive position, we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariffs for our requirements.  The following table presents the estimated annual increase in our total fuel expense and decrease in net income if coal and coal transportation costs were to increase by 1% on any requirements currently not covered by fixed price contracts for the five year period 2005 through 2009:   Coal Transportation Fuel Expense Net Income(a) Fuel Expense Net Income(a) Ameren $ 7 $ (5 ) $ 6 $ (4 ) UE 4 (3 ) 4 (3 ) Genco 2 (1 ) 1 CILCORP(b) 1 1 CILCO 1 1 (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 35%. (b) CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances.  In the event of a significant change in coal prices, UE, Genco and CILCO would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources.  With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel, UE has fixed priced and base price with escalation agreements and or inventories to fulfill its Callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services through 2006. UE expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected remainder of the life of the plant, at prices which cannot now be accurately predicted. UEs strategy is to hedge at least 75% of its three year requirements. This strategy permits optimum timing of new forward contracts given the relatively long price cycles in the nuclear fuel markets. It also provides security of supply to protect against unforeseen market disruptions. Unlike electricity and natural gas markets, there are no sophisticated financial instruments in nuclear fuel markets, so most hedging is done via inventories and forward contracts.  With regard to our electric generating operations for UE, Genco and CILCO that are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run the CTs, the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs. This is accomplished by optimizing transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins.  Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the advent of the MISO Day Two Market. Marketing Company has been granted FTRs for its participation in the PJM Com Ed market. We sought and received FTRs with the intent to hedge (offset) expected electric transmission congestion charges related to our physical electricity business. Depending on the congestion on the grid and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid, FTRs could result in either charges or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to determine which FTRs we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is a risk that we incorrectly modeled the amount of FTRs we will need, and there is the potential that some of the FTR hedges could be ineffective.  With regard to UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs natural gas distribution businesses, exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact there are gas cost recovery mechanisms (PGA clauses) in place in both Missouri and Illinois. These gas cost recovery mechanisms allow UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred costs of natural gas. To prudently manage costs, our strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations on our regulated natural gas customers. We cannot eliminate the effects of gas price volatility. However, the gas procurement strategy utilizes similar risk management techniques and instruments outlined earlier combined with management of physical assets including storage and operator and balancing agreements.  60  The following table presents the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired power plants, nuclear fuel for UEs Callaway nuclear plant and natural gas for our gas fired generation (CTs) and retail distribution, as appropriate, which are price hedged over the five year period 2005 through 2009:   2005 2006 2007 2009 Ameren: Coal 92 % 88 % 49 % Coal transportation 99 96 64 Nuclear fuel 100 100 34 Natural gas for generation 35 8 1 Natural gas for distribution(b) 89 9 6 UE: Coal 92 % 87 % 45 % Coal transportation 100 99 61 Nuclear fuel 100 100 34 Natural gas for generation 9 6 3 Natural gas for distribution(b) 100 13 6 CIPS: Natural gas for distribution(b) 89 % 16 % 13 % Genco: Coal 95 % 88 % 58 % Coal transportation 98 98 65 Natural gas for generation 40 7 1 CILCORP:(a) Coal 93 % 92 % 46 % Coal transportation 97 73 68 Natural gas for distribution(b) 98 18 12 CILCO: Coal 93 % 92 % 46 % Coal transportation 97 73 68 Natural gas for distribution(b) 98 18 12 IP: Natural gas for distribution(b) 80 % (a) CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (b) Represents the percentage of natural gas price hedged for the peak winter season which includes the months of November through March. The year 2005 represents the period January 2005 through March 2005. The year 2006 represents November 2005 through March 2006. This continues each successive year through March 2009.  See Supply for Electric Power under Part I, Item 1, of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydro and oil. Also see Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information.  Fair Value of Contracts  Most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales. We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity and emission credits.  Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel and electricity cause:  an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our firm commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sales prices under the firm commitment are compared with current commodity prices; market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power to differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory under firm commitment; and actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities to differ from anticipated cash outlays.  The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by risk management policies that control the use of forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements. See Note 9 Derivative Financial Instruments to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information.   61  The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) changes in the fair value of all derivative contracts marked to market during the year ended December 31, 2004.
