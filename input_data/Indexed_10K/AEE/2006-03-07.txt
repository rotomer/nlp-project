ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Ameren Executive Summary Operations A highlight of 2005 was the successful completion of the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant. It was the most extensive in the Callaway plants history and also one of the most efficient and effective outages. During the outage, the plant was refueled and the steam generators and turbine rotors were replaced. The outage, originally scheduled to last 70 to 75 days, was completed in about 63 days. The replacement of the steam generators and turbine rotors is expected to improve reliability and has increased plant capacity by approximately 60 megawatts, positioning the plant very well for the future. Amerens coal fired power plants also achieved availability levels that were slightly higher than the record levels achieved in 2004. A major challenge in 2005 came from disruptions in deliveries of coal by rail from the Powder River Basin, which provides over 85% of Amerens coal requirements. Deliveries in 2005 were well below expected levels due to rail maintenance, which resulted in lower than normal inventory levels. The impact of the coal delivery issues on inventory levels was exacerbated by warm summer weather and high power prices, which caused the plants to run more and burn more coal. In order to maintain acceptable coal inventory levels, higher cost Illinois coal was purchased and interchange sales were reduced; both of which had a negative impact on 2005 earnings. In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility that resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which damaged a state park. At this point, it is too early to say when, or if, the plant will return to service. Any decision on the future of the plant will wait until after reviews by state and federal authorities are concluded, further analyses are completed and input is received from key stakeholders. At this time, UE believes that substantially all of the damage and liabilities caused by the breach will be covered by insurance. Under UEs insurance policies, all claims by UE are subject to review by its insurance carriers. 33 Table of Contents Earnings Ameren reported earnings of $3.02 per share for 2005 which compared to earnings of $2.84 per share last year. Excluding an 11 cent per share fourth quarter 2005 charge for the adoption of a new accounting principle related to AROs, Amerens earnings for 2005 were $3.13 per share. Improved operating earnings in 2005 resulted from the successful integration of IP, and greater availability of Amerens low cost coal fired power plants. This availability allowed Ameren to enhance operating margins as it supplied increased native load demand resulting from warmer summer weather and took advantage of higher power prices on short term energy sales. In addition, operating earnings benefited from organic growth in Amerens service territory and from the sale of certain assets from its leveraged lease portfolio. These benefits more than offset increased fuel and purchased power expenses, including higher costs of operating in the MISO Day Two Energy Market. Liquidity Cash flows from operations of $1.2 billion in 2005 at Ameren, along with other funds, were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of $511 million and fund capital expenditures of $947 million. Capital expenditures included investments made at UEs Callaway nuclear plant and in CTs, in addition to more routine expenditures. In 2005, UE announced the acquisition of 1,490 megawatts of CTs for $290 million, subject to regulatory approvals. These acquisitions are expected to be completed in 2006. Financing activities in 2005 primarily consisted of refinancing debt and funding capital investment. Outlook Ameren expects continued economic growth in its service territory to benefit energy demand in 2006 and beyond, but higher energy prices could result in reduced demand from consumers. Amerens coal and related transportation costs rose in 2005 and are expected to rise 10% to 15% in 2006 and another 15% to 20% in 2007. By the end of 2006, bundled electric rates for Amerens three Illinois electric distribution subsidiaries CIPS, CILCO and IP will have been fixed or declining for periods ranging from 15 years to 25 years. In addition, power supplied by certain of Amerens non rate regulated generation subsidiaries has been partially subject to long term fixed price contracts to supply Amerens Illinois electric distribution subsidiaries. On December 31, 2006, the Illinois electric rate freeze and the long term fixed price affiliate power supply contracts expire. Prices reflected in the current long term fixed price power supply contracts are below market prices for similar contracts in early 2006. In 2006, the ICC will rule on CIPS, CILCOs and IPs request for a combined $200 million electric rate increase for electric delivery services. In addition, there is expected to be an auction in September 2006 for their power supply for 2007 and beyond in which Genco and AERG will likely participate through Marketing Company subject to limitations. In Missouri, UE has a rate moratorium set to expire June 30, 2006. Rates will not change until such time as a rate adjustment is requested and the MoPSC hears and rules on a rate adjustment request. UE has not made a final determination as to when it will file a rate case. The appropriate test year, economic and energy market conditions, expected plant additions and the rulemaking process surrounding fuel, purchased power and environmental cost recovery mechanisms, among other things, will drive the decision on when to file a rate case. The MoPSC staff and others will review an electric cost of service study submitted by UE in December 2005 and, based upon their analysis, may make their own recommendations for rate adjustments. The EPA is requiring more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants. Between 2006 and 2016, Ameren expects its subsidiaries will be required to spend between $2.1 billion and $2.9 billion to retrofit its power plants with pollution control equipment. Between 55% and 60% of this investment will be at UE and therefore is expected to be recoverable over time from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts invested in non rate regulated operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust to reflect this increased investment by the industry. General Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company registered with FERC under PUHCA 2005. Ameren was registered with the SEC as a public utility holding company under PUHCA 1935, until its repeal effective February 8, 2006. Amerens primary asset is the common stock of its subsidiaries. Amerens subsidiaries operate rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses, rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution businesses and non rate regulated electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois, as discussed below. Dividends on Amerens common stock are dependent on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed description of our principal subsidiaries. UE operates a rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution business, and a rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution business in Missouri. Before May 2, 2005, UE also operated those businesses in Illinois. CIPS operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. Genco operates a non rate regulated electric generation business. 34 Table of Contents CILCO, a subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company), operates a rate regulated electric transmission and distribution business, a primarily non rate regulated electric generation business (through its subsidiary, AERG) and a rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. IP operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority owned subsidiaries. As the acquisition of IP occurred on September 30, 2004, Amerens Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows for the periods before September 30, 2004, do not reflect IPs results of operations or financial position. Financial information for CILCORP and CILCO in Amerens consolidated financial statements begins with January 31, 2003, when these companies were acquired. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information on the accounting for the IP and CILCORP acquisitions. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are expressed in millions, unless otherwise indicated. In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, we present certain information in cents per share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect Amerens earnings. We believe this per share information helps readers to understand the impact of these factors on Amerens earnings per share. All references in this report to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares outstanding during the applicable year. IP Acquisition On September 30, 2004, Ameren completed the acquisition of all the common stock and 662,924 shares of preferred stock of IP and an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI from subsidiaries of Dynegy. Ameren acquired IP to complement its existing Illinois electric and gas operations. The purchase included IPs rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business serving 625,000 electric customers and 425,000 gas customers in areas contiguous to our Illinois utility service territories. With the acquisition, IP became an Ameren subsidiary, operating as AmerenIP. The total transaction value was $2.3 billion, including the assumption of $1.8 billion of IP debt and preferred stock. Cash consideration was $429 million, net of $51 million cash acquired, and included transaction costs. In addition, this transaction included a fixed price capacity power supply agreement for IPs annual purchase in 2005 and 2006 of 2,800 megawatts of electricity from DYPM. The contract was marked to fair value at closing of the IP acquisition. This agreement supplied about 70% of IPs electric customer requirements during 2005; it is expected to supply about 70% of the requirements in 2006. The remaining 30% of IPs power needs in 2006 will be supplied by other companies through contracts and open market purchases. In the event that suppliers are unable to supply the electricity required by existing agreements, IP would be forced to find alternative suppliers to meet its load requirements, thus exposing itself to market price risk, which could have a material impact on Amerens and IPs results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Ameren funded this acquisition with the issuance of new Ameren common stock. Ameren issued an aggregate of 30 million common shares in February 2004 and July 2004, which generated net proceeds of $1.3 billion. These proceeds were used to finance the cash portion of the purchase price, to reduce IP debt assumed as part of this transaction, and to pay related premiums. For income tax purposes, Ameren and Dynegy have elected to treat Amerens acquisition of IP stock as an asset acquisition under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Acquisition Accounting The amortization of noncash purchase accounting fair value adjustments at IP increased Amerens and IPs net income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, as indicated in the table below. The amortization of the fair value adjustments at IP that increased net income were related to pension and postretirement liabilities, long term debt, a power supply contract with EEI, and a power supply contract with Dynegy, which expired in 2004. Partially offsetting these items was the amortization of the fair value adjustment related to another power supply contract for 700 megawatts that also expired in 2004. Concurrent with its acquisition of IP, Ameren negotiated a contract with Dynegy to supply IP 2,800 megawatts for 2005 and 2006. The fair value adjustment associated with this contract is being amortized over the terms of the contract. It has a favorable impact on IPs net income. The fair value adjustment associated with the EEI contract was fully amortized as of December 31, 2005, when that contract expired. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) impact on Amerens and IPs net income of the amortization of purchase accounting fair value adjustments associated with the IP acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2005, and for the three months ended December 31, 2004: Ameren IP 2005 2004 2005 2004 Statement of Income line item: Other operations and maintenance(a) $ 27 $ 7 $ 27 $ 7 Interest(b) 17 10 17 10 Fuel and purchased power(c) 44 26 21 26 Income taxes(d) (35 ) (17 ) (26 ) (17 ) Impact on net income $ 53 $ 26 $ 39 $ 26 35 Table of Contents (a) Related to the adjustment to fair value of the pension and postretirement plans. (b) Related to the adjustment to fair value of all the IP debt assumed at acquisition on September 30, 2004.

See Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. (c) Related to the amortization of fair value adjustments to power supply contracts. (d) Tax effect of the above amortization adjustments. The amortization of noncash purchase accounting fair value adjustments at CILCORP increased Amerens and CILCORPs net income in 2005, 2004 and 2003 as indicated in the table below. The amortization of the fair value adjustments that increased net income were related to pension and postretirement liabilities, coal contract liabilities, and long term debt. The amortization of fair value adjustments that decreased net income were related to electric plant in service, purchased power, and emission credits. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) impact on Amerens and CILCORPs net income of the amortization of purchase accounting fair value adjustments during 2005, 2004, and the 11 months ended December 31, 2003: 2005 2004 2003 Statement of Income line item: Other operations and maintenance(a) $ 8 $ 13 $ 39 Interest(b) 7 8 7 Fuel and purchased power(c) (8 ) (6 ) 1 Depreciation and amortization(d) (5 ) (5 ) (7 ) Income taxes(e) (1 ) (4 ) (16 ) Impact on net income $ 1 $ 6 $ 24 (a) Related to the adjustment to fair value of the pension and postretirement plans, retail customer contracts and investment assets.

(d) Related to plant assets at Duck Creek, E.D. Edwards, and Sterling Avenue being amortized over the remaining useful lives of the plants. (e) Tax effect of the above amortization adjustments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Summary Our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations: winter heating and summer cooling demands. About 85% of Amerens revenues are directly subject to state and federal regulation. This regulation can have a material impact on the price we charge for our services. Our non rate regulated sales are subject to market conditions for power. We principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil in our operations. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the global economic and political environment, weather, supply and demand, and many other factors. We do not currently have fuel or purchased power cost recovery mechanisms in Missouri or Illinois for our electric utility businesses, but we do have gas cost recovery mechanisms in each state for our gas delivery businesses. The electric and gas rates for UE in Missouri are set through June 2006 and for CIPS, CILCO and IP in Illinois through January 1, 2007; therefore, cost decreases or increases will not be immediately reflected in rates. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our cost of borrowing and our pension and postretirement benefits costs. We employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risks and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of our power plants and transmission and distribution systems, the level of purchased power costs, operating and administrative costs, and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Amerens net income for 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $606 million ($3.02 per share), $530 million ($2.84 per share), and $524 million ($3.25 per share), respectively. In 2005, Amerens net income included a net cumulative effect aftertax loss of $22 million (11 cents per share) associated with recording liabilities for conditional AROs as a result of our adoption of FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. In 2003, Amerens net income included an aftertax gain of $31 million (19 cents per share) related to the settlement of a dispute over mine reclamation issues with a coal supplier and a net cumulative effect aftertax gain of $18 million (11 cents per share) associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The coal contract settlement gain recaptured coal costs, plus accrued interest, paid to a coal supplier for future reclamation of a coal mine that principally supplied a UE power plant. The SFAS No. 143 net gain resulted principally from the elimination from accumulated depreciation of accrued costs of removal for non rate regulated assets; these accrued costs of removal were not legal obligations. The following table presents net cumulative effect aftertax gains (losses) recorded upon adoption of FIN 47 in 2005 and SFAS No. 143 in 2003: Net Cumulative Effect Aftertax Gain (Loss) 2005 FIN 47 2003 SFAS No. 143 Ameren(a)(b) $ (22 ) $ 18 Genco (16 ) 18 CILCORP(c) (2 ) 4 CILCO (2 ) 24 IP(c) (2 ) (a) Includes amounts for EEI. (b) 2003 excludes amounts for IP and CILCORP as SFAS No. 143 was adopted prior to the acquisitions by Ameren. (c) Represents predecessor information for 2003. 36 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of Amerens net income to net income, excluding the coal contract settlement discussed above. It also shows the effect of FIN 47 and SFAS No. 143 adoption, all net of taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2005, and 2003. Ameren believes that this reconciliation presents results from continuing operations on a more comparable basis. However, our presentation of net income or earnings per share excluding restructuring charges and other items is not a presentation defined under GAAP, and it may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP presentation included in Amerens financial statements. 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 606 $ 530 $ 524 Earnings per share diluted $ 3.02 $ 2.84 $ 3.25 FIN 47 adoption loss, net of taxes 22 Coal contract settlement, net of taxes (31 ) SFAS No. 143 adoption gain, net of taxes (18 ) Total of coal contract settlement, and the effect of FIN 47 and SFAS No. 143 adoption, net of taxes $ 22 $ $ (49 ) per share $ 0.11 $ $ (0.30 ) Net income, excluding coal contract settlement, and the effect of FIN 47 and SFAS No. 143 adoption $ 628 $ 530 $ 475 Earnings per share, excluding coal contract settlement, and the effect of FIN 47 and SFAS No. 143 adoption diluted $ 3.13 $ 2.84 $ 2.95 Excluding the loss on the adoption of FIN 47 in 2005, Amerens net income increased $98 million, and earnings per share increased 29 cents in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase in net income was primarily due to warmer weather in the summer of 2005 compared with extremely mild conditions in the summer of 2004 (estimated at 24 to 28 cents per share), inclusion of IP results for an additional nine months in 2005 (23 cents per share), increased margins on interchange sales (11 cents per share), the lower cost of the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant in 2005 versus the 2004 refueling and maintenance outage (3 cents per share), increased emission credit earnings (2 cents per share), net gains on sales of leveraged leases in 2005 (7 cents per share), employee benefit costs (5 cents per share) and organic growth in revenues. Partially offsetting these increases to net income were incremental costs of operating in the MISO Day Two Energy Market (29 cents per share), increased labor costs (8 cents per share), and increased fuel and purchased power costs. In addition, net income in 2004 benefited from a FERC ordered refund of $18 million in exit fees, which had been previously paid by UE and CIPS to the MISO, upon their re entry into the MISO (6 cents per share). Cents per share information in this paragraph is based on average shares outstanding in 2004. An increase in the number of common shares outstanding also reduced Amerens earnings per share in 2005 compared with 2004. Excluding the gains on the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the settlement of the coal mine reclamation dispute in the prior year, Amerens net income increased $55 million and earnings per share decreased 11 cents in 2004 from 2003. The change in net income was primarily due to organic growth in revenues, increased margins on interchange sales, primarily due to greater availability of low cost generation (16 cents per share), gas delivery rate increases (10 cents per share), lower labor costs (8 cents per share), the MISO refund of previously paid exit fees upon UEs and CIPS reentry into the MISO in the second quarter of 2004 (6 cents per share), and the results of CILCORPs inclusion for an additional month and IPs inclusion for three months in 2004. Partially offsetting these increases to income were increased fuel and purchased power costs and other operations and maintenance costs as a result of UEs Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in the second quarter of 2004 (22 cents per share), extremely mild 2004 weather conditions (estimated at 12 to 16 cents per share), electric rate reductions (13 cents per share), and higher employee benefit costs (11 cents per share). Cents per share information in this paragraph is based on average shares outstanding in 2003. An increase in the number of common shares outstanding also reduced Amerens earnings per share in 2004 compared with 2003. Because it is a holding company, Amerens net income and cash flows are primarily generated by its principal subsidiaries: UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. The following table presents the contribution by Amerens principal subsidiaries to Amerens consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 Net income: UE(a) $ 346 $ 373 $ 441 CIPS 41 29 26 Genco(a) 97 107 75 CILCORP(a)(b) 3 10 14 IP(c) 95 27 Other(d) 24 (16 ) (32 ) Ameren net income $ 606 $ 530 $ 524 (a) Includes earnings from market based interchange power sales that provided the following contributions to net income: UE: 2005 $75 million; 2004 $75 million; 2003 $58 million. Genco: 2005 $47 million; 2004 $39 million; 2003 $30 million. CILCORP: 2005 $13 million. (b) Excludes net income prior to the acquisition on January 31, 2003. (c) Excludes net income prior to the acquisition on September 30, 2004. (d) Includes gains on leveraged lease sales in 2005, corporate general and administrative expenses, transition costs associated with the CILCORP and IP acquisitions and other non rate regulated operations. 37 Table of Contents Electric Operations The following tables present the favorable (unfavorable) variations in electric margins, defined as electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs, from the previous year for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. We consider electric and interchange margins useful measures to analyze the change in profitability of our electric operations between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information we provide in accordance with GAAP. However, electric and interchange margins may not be a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we provide elsewhere in this report. The variation in electric margin for Ameren shows the contribution from IP for the first nine months of 2005, from IP for the last three months of 2004, and from CILCORP for January 2004 as separate line items, which allows an easier comparison with other margin components. The variation in IP electric margin in 2005 is compared with the full year of 2004, despite Amerens acquisition of IP occurring on September 30, 2004. The variation in IP electric margin for the full year in 2004 is compared with the full year of 2003, when Ameren did not own IP and it did not contribute to Amerens electric margins. The variations in CILCORP and CILCO electric margins in 2004 are compared with the full year of 2003. Before January 31, 2003, Ameren did not own CILCORP and CILCO, so they did not contribute to Amerens electric margins. 2005 versus 2004 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO IP(c) Electric revenue change: IP January through September 2005 $ 861 $ $ $ $ $ $ Effect of weather (estimate) 115 72 24 16 16 51 Growth and other (estimate) 120 21 149 97 Rate reductions (7 ) (7 ) Interchange revenues 79 143 (1 ) 67 (20 ) (20 ) Total $ 1,168 $ 229 $ 172 $ 164 $ (4 ) $ (4 ) $ 51 Fuel and purchased power change: IP January through September 2005 $ (509 ) $ $ $ $ $ $ Fuel: Generation and other (92 ) (83 ) 8 (17 ) (15 ) Price (45 ) (41 ) (29 ) 25 25 Purchased power (156 ) (127 ) (131 ) (160 ) (20 ) (20 ) (62 ) Total $ (802 ) $ (251 ) $ (131 ) $ (181 ) $ (12 ) $ (10 ) $ (62 ) Net change in electric margins $ 366 $ (22 ) $ 41 $ (17 ) $ (16 ) $ (14 ) $ (11 ) 2004 versus 2003 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP(b) CILCO IP(c) Electric revenue change: CILCORP January 2004 $ 49 $ $ $ $ $ $ IP October through December 2004 229 Effect of weather (estimate) (38 ) (24 ) (12 ) (1 ) (1 ) (16 ) Growth and other (estimate) 70 44 (5 ) 65 (196 ) (196 ) (25 ) Rate reductions (34 ) (34 ) Interchange revenues 69 20 23 27 27 Total $ 345 $ 6 $ (17 ) $ 88 $ (170 ) $ (170 ) $ (41 ) Fuel and purchased power change: CILCORP January 2004 $ (26 ) $ $ $ $ $ $ IP October through December 2004 (128 ) Fuel: Generation and other (37 ) 5 (23 ) (17 ) (7 ) Price (9 ) (2 ) (6 ) 11 11 Purchased power (17 ) (24 ) 16 2 162 159 57 Total $ (217 ) $ (21 ) $ 16 $ (27 ) $ 156 $ 163 $ 57 Net change in electric margins $ 128 $ (15 ) $ (1 ) $ 61 $ (14 ) $ (7 ) $ 16 (a) Excludes amounts for IP before the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; excludes amounts for CILCORP before the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; and includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (b) Includes predecessor information for periods before January 31, 2003. (c) Includes predecessor information for periods before September 30, 2004. 38 Table of Contents Ameren 2005 versus 2004 Amerens electric margin increased $366 million in 2005 from 2004. 2005 includes an additional nine months of IP results, which added $352 million of electric margin. Electric margin also increased because of higher margins on interchange sales, favorable weather conditions in 2005, sales to a significant new customer, and organic growth. Partially offsetting these increases to electric margin were incremental costs of operating in the MISO Day Two Energy Market and increased fuel and purchased power costs. Electric rate reductions resulting from the 2002 UE electric rate case settlement in Missouri negatively affected electric revenues by $7 million during 2005. These were the final rate reductions under the rate case settlement. Amerens base load electric generating plants average capacity factors were about 76% in both 2005 and 2004. Equivalent availability factors were about 86% in both 2005 and 2004. Record coal fired electric generation plant production was offset by an extended refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant. Margins on interchange sales for Ameren increased $66 million in 2005, as compared with 2004, principally because of higher power prices and access to the MISO Day Two Energy Market. Average realized prices on Amerens interchange sales increased to about $44 per megawatthour in 2005 from about $30 per megawatthour in 2004. High natural gas, emission allowance and coal prices in 2005 contributed to the higher power prices. The MISO Day Two Energy Market also contributed to an increase in margins on interchange sales by an estimated $34 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Warmer summer weather in 2005, compared with extremely mild conditions in the summer of 2004, resulted in a 37% increase in cooling degree days in 2005 in Amerens service territory. Cooling degree days increased 19% from normal conditions in 2005. Excluding the additional nine months of IP sales in 2005, Amerens weather sensitive residential and commercial sales were up 10% and 3%, respectively, in 2005 compared with 2004. Amerens industrial sales, excluding the additional nine months of IP sales in 2005, were comparable in 2005 and 2004. Sales to Noranda, a significant new UE industrial customer in 2005, offset the expiration and nonrenewal of low margin non rate regulated power sales contracts to customers outside our core service territory and decreased low margin resale of power to the DOE by EEI under its power supply contract. Amerens fuel and purchased power costs, excluding the additional nine months of IP results in 2005, increased $293 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of MISO Day Two Energy Market costs, increased fuel and purchased power prices, coal conservation efforts, unscheduled coal fired plant outages during the peak summer period, increased CT generation as a result of the warmer weather in 2005, and increased emission allowance utilization at Genco and AERG. Incremental MISO costs included in purchased power were $107 million in 2005. MISO costs were greater than expected because of higher than anticipated line losses, transmission congestion charges, and charges associated with volatile weather conditions and deviations of actual from forecasted plant availability and customer loads. We attribute some of these higher costs to the relative infancy of the MISO Day Two Energy Market, suboptimal dispatching of plants and price volatility. Increased emission allowance utilization of $47 million in 2005 resulted in higher fuel costs. Fuel and purchased power costs were reduced in 2005 by a $21 million gain at Genco resulting from the nonmonetary swap of certain earlier vintage year SO2 emission allowances for later vintage year allowances. Fuel and purchased power costs for UEs 2005 Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage were comparable with the 2004 refueling and maintenance outage. 2004 versus 2003 Amerens electric margin increased $128 million in 2004 from 2003. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in 2004, electric margin increased $4 million. Strong organic growth due to improved economic conditions and increased margins on interchange sales more than offset the effect of unfavorable weather conditions, increased fuel and purchased power costs due to the second quarter 2004 Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage, and rate reductions in 2004. In addition, earnings from emission credit sales decreased $7 million in 2004 compared with 2003. According to the National Weather Service, summer weather in 2004 in Amerens service territory was the seventh mildest in the past 110 years. Cooling degree days during that period in Amerens service territory were down about 20% from both normal conditions and from the prior year. Warmer winter weather in 2004 also resulted in heating degree days that were down about 7% in 2004 in Amerens service territory from 2003, and down about 10% from normal conditions. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP sales and three months of IP sales in 2004, residential sales were flat compared to 2003, because organic growth offset the impact of the unfavorable weather conditions. Commercial and industrial sales increased 2% in 2004 because economic conditions improved. Rate reductions resulting from the 2002 UE electric rate case settlement in Missouri negatively affected electric revenues during 2004 compared to 2003. Annual reductions 39 Table of Contents of $50 million, $30 million, and $30 million were effective April 1, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. Margins on interchange sales increased $37 million in 2004 from 2003. This was because of increased availability of low cost generation resulting from record power generation and reduced demand from native load customers due to the mild summer weather. In addition to increased availability of low cost power, sales in 2004 also benefited because higher natural gas and coal prices both contributed to increased power prices. In 2004, Amerens baseload coal fired electric generating plants average capacity factor was about 76%, despite the extremely mild weather, compared with 73% in 2003. The equivalent availability factor was about 86%, compared with 85% in the prior year period. Amerens fuel and purchased power costs increased $63 million, excluding the additional month of CILCORP and the additional three months of IP in 2004, compared with 2003, because of increased power purchases necessitated by the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage in 2004 as well as increased coal fired generation and fuel prices. UE 2005 versus 2004 UEs electric margin decreased $22 million in 2005, from 2004, primarily because of the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS, reduced rates in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to the first quarter of 2004, increased fuel and purchased power costs, and decreased emission credit sales. Emission credit sales decreased $12 million in 2005, as UE continued to evaluate options for complying with the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which includes using emission credits for compliance purposes. Partially offsetting these decreases to margin were sales to Noranda, a significant new industrial customer in 2005, increased interchange sales, and favorable weather conditions. On May 2, 2005, following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, UE completed the transfer of its Illinois service territory, including its Illinois based electric and gas utility, to CIPS. The transfer resulted in an estimated decrease in electric margin of $74 million in 2005. Effective June 1, 2005, UE began to supply about 470 megawatts (peak load) of electric service (or about 5% of UEs generating capability, including currently committed purchases) to Norandas primary aluminum smelter in southeast Missouri under a 15 year agreement. The additional sales to Noranda increased electric margin by $33 million in 2005. This increase in industrial sales was partially offset by the effect of the transfer of UEs industrial customers in its Illinois service territory to CIPS. Increased interchange margins and favorable weather conditions in the summer of 2005 added to margins in the current year. Margins on interchange sales with nonaffiliates increased $26 million in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily because of higher power prices and access to the MISO Day Two Energy Market. The MISO Day Two Energy Market resulted in an increase in margins on interchange sales by an estimated $23 million in 2005 compared to 2004. Residential and commercial sales increased 10% and 4%, respectively, in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily as a result of favorable weather conditions. Fuel and purchased power increased in 2005, from 2004, primarily because of MISO Day Two Energy Market costs, increased fuel and purchased power prices, coal conservation efforts, and increased CT generation to serve increased summer demand. MISO costs included in purchased power were $59 million in 2005. Fuel and purchased power costs for the 2005 Callaway refueling and maintenance outage were comparable with the 2004 refueling and maintenance outage. 2004 versus 2003 UEs electric margin decreased $15 million in 2004, compared with 2003. Residential sales in 2004 were comparable with prior year sales as the effect of mild summer weather was offset by organic growth. Rate reductions from the 2002 rate case settlement negatively affected electric revenues during 2004 compared to 2003. Partially offsetting these decreases to electric margin were increased interchange margins. Margins on interchange sales increased $23 million in 2004 from 2003, because of increased availability of low cost generation and higher power prices. Earnings from emission credit sales decreased $3 million in 2004 compared with 2003. Fuel and purchased power increased $20 million in 2004, primarily because of increased purchased power of $24 million resulting from the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage during the second quarter of 2004, partially offset by decreased demand due to mild summer weather conditions in 2004. CIPS CIPS electric margin increased $41 million in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase was primarily due to favorable weather conditions, increased industrial sales as a result of the transfer to CIPS of UEs Illinois service territory, and customers switching to CIPS from Marketing Company because tariff rates were below market rates. The transfer of the Illinois service territory resulted in an estimated increase in electric margin of $27 million in 2005. Partially offsetting these margin increases were increased MISO costs. MISO costs included in purchased power were $23 million in 2005. 40 Table of Contents CIPS 2004 electric margin was comparable with the margin in 2003. Electric margin in 2004 was favorably affected by an industrial customer who switched from CIPS to Marketing Company and by the elimination of the negative margin associated with this customer. Unfavorable weather conditions offset the increases to margin. Genco Gencos electric margin decreased $17 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Wholesale margins decreased because Genco purchased higher cost power to serve greater load. The increase in load was due to increased volume from the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS and to warmer than normal weather. Increased purchased power, principally from UE under the joint dispatch agreement, was made necessary by a major power plant maintenance outage that occurred primarily during the first quarter of 2005. Emission allowance utilization increased fuel and purchased power costs by $26 million in 2005. Fuel and purchased power costs were reduced in 2005 by a net gain of $15 million associated with a $21 million nonmonetary swap of certain earlier vintage year SO2 emission allowances for later vintage year allowances, partially offset by losses of $6 million on emissions allowance options. Interchange margins increased $23 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of higher power prices and access to the MISO Day Two Energy Market. The MISO Day Two Energy Market resulted in an increase in margins on interchange sales by an estimated $10 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Gencos electric margin increased $61 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase in electric margin was primarily attributable to an increase in wholesale and retail margins due to sales to new customers and increased availability of lower cost generation. Interchange margins increased $14 million in 2004 from 2003, because power prices were higher and more low cost power was available for sale because of the mild weather. CILCORP and CILCO Electric margin decreased $16 million and $14 million at CILCORP and CILCO, respectively, in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of decreased interchange margins and higher fuel and purchased power costs due to unscheduled plant outages during the peak summer period. MISO costs included in purchased power were $8 million in 2005. Increased costs of emission allowance utilization decreased margins by $20 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Decreases in electric margin were partially offset by the use of lower cost coal at one of AERGs power plants, along with favorable weather in the summer of 2005. Electric margin decreased $14 million at CILCORP and $7 million at CILCO in 2004 from 2003. Decreases in electric margin were primarily attributable to reduced revenues. Two large CILCO industrial customers who switched to Marketing Company in July and October 2003 and transfers of other non rate regulated customers to Marketing Company accounted for a $168 million decrease in electric revenues. Fuel and purchased power also decreased because customers switched to Marketing Company. IP IPs electric margin decreased $11 million in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily because of higher purchased power and MISO costs in 2005. Although power costs decreased in 2005 under IPs new power supply agreement with DYPM, costs on other power purchase contracts were higher than in 2004. MISO costs included in purchased power were $9 million in 2005 versus none in 2004. Partially offsetting these decreases to electric margin were favorable weather conditions in 2005. IPs electric margin increased $16 million in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase in electric margin was principally due to lower purchased power costs that included the benefit of purchase accounting adjustments of $26 million recorded by IP in 2004. Revenues were reduced because of unfavorable summer weather. Electric margin was also unfavorably affected by industrial customers who chose alternative suppliers. 41 Table of Contents Gas Operations The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) variations in gas margins, defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale, compared with the prior periods for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. We consider gas margin to be a useful measure of the change in profitability of our gas utility operations between periods. The table below complements the financial information we provide in accordance with GAAP. However, gas margin may not be a presentation defined under GAAP. Our presentation may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we provide elsewhere in this report. 2005 2004 Ameren(a) $ 120 $ 77 UE 10 9 CIPS 6 CILCORP 2 8 CILCO 2 6 IP(b) 2 (4 ) (a) Excludes amounts for IP before the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (b) Includes predecessor information prior to September 30, 2004. Amerens gas margin increased $120 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of the inclusion of an additional nine months of IP results in the current year. Excluding these IP results, gas margin increased $16 million, primarily as a result of more favorable weather conditions in the fourth quarter of 2005 than in the same period in 2004, when we experienced mild weather in our service territory. UEs gas margin increased in 2005, compared with 2004, because of the effect of rate increases in the first quarter of 2005 and favorable weather, partially offset by the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS. CIPS gas margin was comparable in 2005 to 2004. The transfer to CIPS of UEs service territory and favorable weather conditions offset gas inventory adjustments. The service territory transfer resulted in an increase of $4 million in CIPS gas margin in 2005, and an equivalent decrease in UEs gas margin. CILCORPs and CILCOs gas margins increased in 2005 over 2004 primarily as a result of favorable weather in the fourth quarter of 2005. IPs gas margin increased because of a rate increase effective in May 2005 that added $6 million, partially offset by unfavorable winter weather during the first quarter of 2005. Gas margins at Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO increased in 2004, compared to 2003, primarily because of delivery rate increases, partially offset by milder winter weather conditions. Amerens gas margin also increased $13 million because of the additional month of CILCORP results and $40 million because of the three months of IP results in 2004. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP and the three months of IP in 2004, Amerens sales were down 5% as a result of the mild winter weather. IPs gas margin decreased $4 million in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of milder winter weather in 2004. Operating Expenses and Other Statement of Income Items Other Operations and Maintenance Ameren Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $150 million in 2005 compared with 2004. IP expenses in the first nine months of 2005 added other operations and maintenance expenses of $166 million to Ameren. Excluding these IP expenses, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $16 million at Ameren. Plant maintenance expenditures decreased because the expenses related to the 2005 UE Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage were lower in 2005 than in 2004. Refueling and maintenance outages occur approximately every 18 months and typically include fuel replacement, maintenance, and inspections. Maintenance and labor costs for refueling and maintenance outages were $31 million in 2005 compared with $39 million in 2004. The 2005 and 2004 refueling and maintenance outages lasted about 64 days; however, in 2005, the outage included more capital activities and less maintenance activities than 2004. In 2005, Ameren replaced steam generators and turbine rotors in addition to normal maintenance procedures. Lower employee benefit costs also resulted in reduced other operations and maintenance expenses in 2005. Ameren and several subsidiaries consummated the sale of leveraged lease assets in the fourth quarter of 2005. The net pretax gain on the sale of these assets was $26 million. Partially offsetting these favorable items was an impairment of $10 million recorded in the third quarter of 2005 related to Amerens investment in a leveraged lease of an aircraft to Delta Air Lines, Inc., which filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2005. Additionally, labor costs, other than those incurred for the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage, were higher in 2005 compared with 2004. Ameren, UE and CIPS received a refund of previously paid exit fees totaling $18 million upon their reentry into the MISO during the second quarter of 2004. This refund did not recur in 2005 and, therefore, other operations and maintenance expenses for this item increased in 2005 relative to 2004. Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $113 million in 2004 from 2003. The additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in 2004 accounted for $15 million and $43 million, respectively, of other operations and maintenance expense in 2004 compared with 2003. Additionally, expenses at Ameren 42 Table of Contents increased $55 million in 2004, primarily because of increased maintenance expenses of $39 million stemming from the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant during the second quarter of 2004. The previous refueling and maintenance outage occurred in the fall of 2002. In addition to the Callaway nuclear plant outage expenses, employee benefit costs were $43 million higher, primarily because of increased pension and postretirement medical costs. The adoption in the second quarter of 2004, retroactive to January 1, 2004, of FSP SFAS No. 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, resulted in the recognition of nontaxable federal subsidies expected to be provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act (the Medicare Prescription Drug Subsidy), which partially offset the employee benefit cost increases noted above ($11 million). See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. Expenses at Ameren, UE and CIPS were reduced in 2004 by $18 million, $13 million, and $5 million, respectively, from the refund to UE and CIPS of previously paid exit fees upon their reentry into the MISO. Lower labor costs of $21 million in 2004 also partially offset the above increases to other operations and maintenance expenses. UE Other operations and maintenance expenses at UE decreased $14 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of reduced plant maintenance costs in 2005. Other operations and maintenance expenses associated with the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant were $8 million lower in 2005 than in 2004. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2004, there was an unscheduled outage at the Callaway nuclear plant and planned outages at two coal fired plants. The transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS decreased other operations and maintenance expenses by $16 million in 2005. Partially offsetting these favorable variances were increased labor costs and storm damage expenses in 2005. Additionally, UE received a $13 million MISO exit fee refund during the second quarter of 2004. Other operations and maintenance expenses at UE increased $38 million in 2004 over 2003, primarily because of increased power plant maintenance expenses of $39 million for the refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant, as discussed above. In addition to the Callaway outage expenses, employee benefit costs increased by $8 million. These were primarily increased pension costs, partially offset by reduced postretirement costs due to the adoption of FSP SFAS No. 106 2, noted above. In addition, the refund of exit fees of $13 million upon UEs reentry into the MISO also partially offset the increased costs. CIPS Other operations and maintenance expenses at CIPS decreased $4 million in 2005 from 2004 primarily as a result of lower information technology, employee benefit, and administrative and general costs. These positive items were partially offset by the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS, which resulted in an increase in other operations and maintenance expenses of $16 million in 2005. Additionally, CIPS received a $5 million MISO exit fee refund during the second quarter of 2004 that did not recur in 2005. CIPS other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $8 million in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of CIPS portion of the MISO exit fee refund and lower labor costs, partially offset by increased employee benefit costs of $2 million. Genco Other operations and maintenance expenses at Genco increased $4 million in 2005 over 2004 primarily because of a major power plant maintenance outage in 2005, which was partially offset by reduced employee benefit costs. Other operations and maintenance expenses at Genco decreased $6 million in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of a reduction in power plant maintenance of $10 million, a result of fewer outages and lower labor costs, partially offset by increased employee benefit costs of $5 million. CILCORP and CILCO Other operations and maintenance expenses at CILCORP and CILCO decreased $16 million and $14 million, respectively, in 2005 from 2004. Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased primarily because of lower employee benefit costs in 2005 and the absence of an $8 million charge similar to 2004 for the cost of settling a litigation claim by Enron Power Marketing, Inc. in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of CILCORP in 2003. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was the recognition of a pretax loss of $5 million at CILCO on the sale of a leveraged lease in the fourth quarter of 2005 and increased plant maintenance expenditures due to plant outages. CILCORPs and CILCOs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $41 million and $33 million, respectively, in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily because of higher employee benefit costs of $12 million, the settlement of the litigation claim discussed above, and additional injury and damage costs of $4 million. CILCOs other operations and maintenance expenses also increased because of higher maintenance costs of $3 million, higher information technology expenses of $3 million, and higher overhead allocations. Partially offsetting these 43 Table of Contents increases to other operations and maintenance expenses at CILCORP and CILCO were reduced labor costs in 2004. IP IPs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $39 million in 2005 over 2004, due in part to the receipt of a refund of previously paid exit fees of $9 million from MISO during the third quarter of 2004. Other operations and maintenance expenses also increased because of higher tree trimming expenses and increased overhead and labor costs associated with the integration of systems and operations with Ameren in 2005. IPs other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $19 million in 2004 from 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from the $9 million reimbursement of the MISO exit fee discussed above, as well as reduced labor costs and other operating efficiencies of $12 million. Partially offsetting these favorable variances were higher employee benefit costs of $8 million and costs associated with injuries and damages. Coal Contract Settlement See Note 7 Restructuring Charges and Other Special Items to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Depreciation and Amortization 2005 versus 2004 Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased $75 million in 2005 from 2004, principally because of an additional nine months of IP results in 2005, which added $59 million. Capital additions also resulted in increased depreciation expenses in 2005. Depreciation and amortization expenses at UE increased $30 million in 2005 over 2004. The increases were primarily due to capital additions and depreciation on CTs transferred from Genco to UE in May 2005, partially offset by reduced depreciation on property transferred by UE to CIPS in the Illinois service territory transfer in May 2005. CIPS depreciation and amortization expenses increased $11 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of depreciation on property transferred from UE in the Illinois service territory transfer and capital additions. Depreciation and amortization expenses at Genco decreased $4 million in 2005 from 2004, principally because of the transfer of CTs from Genco to UE in May 2005. Depreciation and amortization expenses at both CILCORP and CILCO increased $3 million in 2005 over 2004, because of capital additions. IPs depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding the amortization of regulatory assets, were comparable in 2005 and 2004. Amortization of regulatory assets at IP decreased $33 million in 2005 from 2004. The transition cost regulatory asset was eliminated in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of IP in September 2004. 2004 versus 2003 Amerens, UEs and IPs depreciation and amortization expenses increased $38 million, $10 million, and $2 million, respectively, in 2004, compared with 2003, because of capital additions. Depreciation and amortization expenses at Ameren also increased in 2004 because 2004 included an additional month of CILCORP expenses of $6 million and three months of IP expenses of $21 million. Amortization of regulatory assets at IP decreased $9 million in 2004 from 2003 as the transition cost regulatory asset was written off in purchase accounting in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of IP. Depreciation and amortization expenses at CIPS and Genco were comparable in 2004 and 2003. Depreciation and amortization expenses at CILCORP and CILCO decreased $9 million and $6 million, respectively, in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily because reduced expenses as a result of property retirements at the end of 2003 exceeded the increased expenses from new capital additions in 2004. CILCORP depreciation was also favorably affected by reduced purchase accounting amortization adjustments. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2005 versus 2004 Amerens taxes other than income taxes increased $53 million in 2005 over 2004 because of an additional nine months of IP results in 2005, which added $54 million. UEs taxes other than income taxes increased $7 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of increased property taxes due to higher assessments. These property tax increases were mitigated in 2005 by the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS. Taxes other than income taxes at CIPS were $7 million higher in 2005 than in 2004, primarily because of increased property taxes resulting from the transfer to CIPS of UEs Illinois service territory. Gencos taxes other than income taxes were $8 million lower in 2005 than they were in 2004, primarily because of a favorable court decision in 2005 regarding property taxes. 44 Table of Contents CILCORPs and CILCOs taxes other than income taxes decreased $5 million and $4 million, respectively, in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily because of reduced gross receipts taxes related to transfers of customers to Marketing Company and to decreased property taxes. Taxes other than income taxes at IP were comparable in 2005 and 2004. 2004 versus 2003 Taxes other than income taxes increased $13 million at Ameren in 2004 over 2003. Excluding the additional month of CILCORP ($6 million) and the three months of IP ($15 million) included in 2004, taxes other than income taxes decreased $8 million. The decrease was primarily due to decreased gross receipts taxes, partially offset by increased property taxes. UEs taxes other than income taxes increased $9 million in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily because of higher property taxes in 2004. Taxes other than income taxes at CIPS, Genco and IP were comparable in 2004 and 2003. Taxes other than income taxes decreased at CILCORP and CILCO by $13 million and $14 million, respectively, in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily because gross receipts taxes were down as a result of customers switching to Marketing Company. Other Income and Expenses 2005 versus 2004 Other income and expenses at Ameren decreased $9 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Excluding the additional nine months of IP results in 2005, other income and expenses at Ameren decreased $14 million from 2004. The decrease was primarily due to reduced interest income from the investment of equity issuance proceeds in the prior year. CIPS other income and expenses were $9 million lower in 2005 than in 2004, primarily because of reduced interest income on the intercompany note receivable from Genco. Other income and expenses at IP decreased $140 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of reduced interest income after the elimination of IPs note receivable from a former affiliate in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of IP on September 30, 2004. Other income and expenses at UE, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO were comparable in 2005 and 2004. 2004 versus 2003 Amerens other income and expenses increased $18 million in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of increased interest income of $8 million from the temporary investment of proceeds from Amerens February and July 2004 equity offerings and increased allowance for funds used during construction of $6 million. The additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in 2004 had a minimal impact on other income and expenses. Total other income at IP decreased $35 million in 2004 from 2003, primarily because interest income was reduced after the elimination of IPs note receivable from former affiliate in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of IP. See Note 2 Acquisitions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the note elimination. Other income and expenses includes interest income of $128 million for 2004 compared with $170 million in 2003 under IPs note receivable from a former affiliate. Other income and expenses at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO were comparable in 2004 and 2003. See Note 8 Other Income and Expenses to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. Interest 2005 versus 2004 Interest expense increased $23 million at Ameren in 2005 from 2004, principally because of the acquisition of IP, which added $32 million of interest for the first nine months of 2005. Excluding the additional IP expense in 2005, interest expense decreased $9 million primarily because of the items discussed below. UEs interest expense increased $12 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily because of the issuances of $300 million of senior secured notes in July 2005, $85 million senior secured notes in January 2005 and $300 million senior secured notes in September 2004, partially offset by maturities of $188 million of first mortgage bonds in August 2004 and $85 million of first mortgage bonds in December 2004 and the redemption of $100 million first mortgage bonds in June 2004. Gencos interest expense decreased $21 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of the maturity of $225 million of senior notes in November 2005, lower average money pool borrowings, and a reduction in principal amounts outstanding on intercompany promissory notes to CIPS and Ameren. The outstanding balance on the intercompany note payable to CIPS was $197 million at December 31, 2005, compared to $283 million at December 31, 2004. The intercompany note payable to Ameren was repaid in 2005. 45 Table of Contents Interest expense at IP decreased $87 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of redemptions and repurchases of indebtedness of $700 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $70 million in early 2005 and reductions in notes payable to IP SPT. Interest expense at CIPS, CILCORP and CILCO was comparable in 2005 and 2004. 2004 versus 2003 Interest expense for Ameren was comparable in 2004 and 2003. However, excluding the additional month of CILCORP results and three months of IP results in 2004, interest expense at Ameren decreased by $20 million. The decrease was primarily due to the maturity of $150 million of Ameren floating rate notes at the end of 2003 and reduced short term borrowings, as well as redemptions of long term debt during 2004 and 2003 at its subsidiaries, as noted below. Gencos interest expense was reduced $7 million in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a reduction in principal amounts outstanding on intercompany promissory notes to CIPS and Ameren. There were also decreased borrowings from Amerens non state regulated subsidiary money pool. The balance of intercompany notes payable to CIPS and Ameren was $283 million at December 31, 2004, $411 million at December 31, 2003, and $462 million at December 31, 2002. Interest expense decreased $32 million at IP in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to redemptions and repurchases of indebtedness of $700 million in 2004 and $190 million in 2003, reductions in the notes payable to IP SPT, and purchase accounting amortization. See Note 5 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity, and Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. Interest expense at UE, CIPS, CILCORP, and CILCO was comparable in 2004 and 2003. Income Taxes 2005 versus 2004 Income tax expense at Ameren increased $74 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily because an additional nine months of IP results included in 2005 added $60 million of income tax expense, and because other pretax income was higher. Partially offsetting these increases at Ameren was the recognition in 2005 of a deduction allowed under the Jobs Creation Act of $5 million. UEs income tax expense decreased in 2005 because of lower pretax income and by the recognition of the Jobs Creation Act deduction. Income tax expense increased at CIPS in 2005 because of higher pretax income, partially offset by tax credits and other permanent tax benefits. Income tax expense was higher at CILCORP and CILCO in 2005 than in 2004, because of the tax benefit in the prior year related to CILCOs settlement of its litigation claim with Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and, in CILCOs case, higher pretax income. Partially offsetting these increases in tax expenses at CILCORP and CILCO were the permanent items related to the leveraged lease sales. Income tax expense at Genco increased in 2005 over 2004 due to higher pretax income. IPs income tax expense was lower in 2005 than in 2004, as pretax income decreased from the prior year. 2004 versus 2003 Income tax expense was lower at Ameren in 2004 than in 2003, because of a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was lower primarily because of the recording in 2004 of the expected nontaxable federal Medicare Prescription Drug Subsidy and the tax benefit related to CILCOs settlement of the Enron Power Marketing, Inc. litigation claim. Income tax expense decreased at UE, primarily because of lower pretax income in 2004. Income tax expense increased at CIPS in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of higher pretax income in 2004 and an Illinois tax settlement in 2003, which resulted in reduced income taxes in the prior year period. Income tax expense increased at Genco and IP in 2004 primarily because of higher pretax income in 2004. The recording of the nontaxable federal Medicare Prescription Drug Subsidy lowered taxable income at all the Ameren companies. Income tax expense decreased at CILCORP and CILCO primarily because of the tax benefit from CILCOs Enron Power Marketing, Inc. litigation claim settlement and lower pretax income in 2004. See also Note 13 Income Taxes to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding effective tax rates. 46 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The tariff based gross margins of Amerens rate regulated utility operating companies (UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP) continue to be the principal source of cash from operating activities for Ameren and its subsidiaries. A diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate regulated residential, commercial and industrial classes and a commodity mix of gas and electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows. For cash flow, Genco principally relies on sales to an affiliate under a contract expiring at the end of 2006 and sales to other wholesale and industrial customers under long term contracts. In addition, we plan to use short term borrowings to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements. The following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Ameren(a) $ 1,171 $ 1,129 $ 1,022 $ (881 ) $ (1,266 ) $ (1,181 ) $ (263 ) $ 95 $ (358 ) UE 698 749 633 (792 ) (580 ) (503 ) 66 (136 ) (124 ) CIPS 133 73 57 (12 ) 78 12 (123 ) (165 ) (70 ) Genco 143 180 211 165 (50 ) (58 ) (309 ) (131 ) (154 ) CILCORP(b) 13 136 70 (89 ) (120 ) (95 ) 72 (20 ) 4 CILCO 47 137 103 (94 ) (125 ) (86 ) 47 (18 ) (31 ) IP(c) 148 247 128 9 (272 ) (126 ) (162 ) 13 (102 ) (a) Excludes amounts for IP before the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; excludes amounts for CILCORP before the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; and includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (b) Includes predecessor information for periods prior to January 31, 2003. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (c) 2004 amounts include predecessor financial information prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004. Cash Flows from Operating Activities 2005 versus 2004 Amerens increase in cash from operations in 2005, as compared with 2004, was primarily attributable to $207 million of incremental IP operating cash flow in the nine months ended September 30, 2005, since Ameren did not own IP during this same period in 2004. Excluding the impact of IP, Amerens increase in electric and gas margins of $14 million and $16 million, respectively, also contributed to the increase in cash from operations. In addition, decreased pension and other postretirement benefit contributions of $206 million and decreased interest payments of $30 million contributed to the favorable variance in cash from operations. Partially offsetting the positive variance in 2005 were increased tax payments of $159 million, additional SO2 emission allowance purchases in 2005 of $86 million, the absence in 2005 of $36 million of cash from the UE coal contract settlement received in 2004, and $92 million of incremental net investment in inventories and trade receivables and payables due to higher gas prices and colder weather in December 2005 as compared to December 2004. The absence in 2005 of $34 million of refunds in 2004 for previously paid fees to MISO and RTO start up costs also partially offset the positive variance in cash from operations. Amerens working capital investment in coal inventories as of December 31, 2005, did not change significantly, as compared with 2004, as a one million ton decrease in volumes due to rail derailments was offset by higher prices. As volumes return to normal levels in 2006, our working capital investment will increase, assuming prices remain at current or higher levels. At UE, cash from operating activities in 2005 was generally consistent with changes in its results of operations and its operating cash flows in 2004. A $127 million decrease in pension and postretirement contributions benefited 2005 operating cash flow as compared to 2004. Significant items negatively impacting cash in 2005 as compared to 2004 include: increased tax payments of $37 million, less cash from electric margins and emissions sales of $36 million, the impact of the coal contract settlement discussed above, the absence of $20 million received in 2004 for MISO exit fees and RTO start up costs discussed above, and incremental working capital investment of $32 million, primarily because of timing differences, prices, and weather as discussed above. CIPS increase in cash from operating activities in 2005 was principally due to increased electric margins of $41 million, a reduction of $23 million in pension and postretirement benefit contributions, and reduced interest and tax payments. This was partially offset by increases in cash outflows caused by differences in the timing and amount of working capital items, as compared with 2004. Cash from operating activities decreased for Genco in 2005 as compared with 2004, primarily due to a $65 million 47 Table of Contents increase in SO2 emissions allowance purchases, and increased tax payments of $41 million. Reduced pension and postretirement contributions of $20 million and lower interest payments of $39 million partially offset the incremental uses of cash. Cash from operating activities decreased for CILCORP and CILCO in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily because of increased tax payments of $60 million for CILCORP and $54 million for CILCO, lower electric margins of $16 million for CILCORP and $14 million for CILCO, and incremental working capital investment of $94 million and $76 million at CILCORP and CILCO, primarily due to higher prices and colder weather, which increased inventories and receivables by approximately $20 million and $28 million (CILCO $31 million), respectively. CILCORPs cash from operating activities was also negatively impacted by additional interest payments of $14 million in 2005 compared to 2004. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in pension and other postretirement contributions of $33 million. IPs cash from operations in 2005 compared with 2004 was impacted by Amerens ownership of IP for all of 2005 compared to only the fourth quarter of last year. IPs operating cash flows in 2005 are not directly comparable with 2004 due to the integration of IP into Amerens operations, significant changes in capital structure, termination of certain of IPs former affiliate agreements and new purchased power arrangements, among other factors. IPs cash from operations in 2005 benefited from lower taxes paid of $141 million, which resulted mostly from changes in taxable income and deferred tax benefits from accelerated depreciation resulting from the acquisition, and lower interest paid of $93 million. Negative impacts to IPs operating cash in 2005 included: the absence of $128 million of interest received from IPs former affiliate, increased cash required for other operations and maintenance expenses of $59 million, and an incremental investment in working capital of $93 million. One of the significant drivers of the increase in working capital investment was colder weather and higher gas prices in December which increased receivables and gas inventories. IPs gas sales were up 45% over December of 2004. 2004 versus 2003 Cash from operating activities increased for Ameren in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of incremental earnings from the acquisition of IP in the fourth quarter of 2004 and lower taxes paid as a result of the pension contribution, IP debt redemption premiums, and accelerated tax depreciation. Ameren and UE also received $36 million in 2004, compared with $15 million in 2003, as a result of UEs 2003 settlement of a dispute over mine reclamation issues with a coal supplier. Cash from operating activities for all the Ameren Companies, except IP, were negatively affected in 2004 by a $295 million pension contribution made by Ameren (UE $186 million; CIPS $33 million; Genco $29 million; CILCORP and CILCO $41 million). Cash provided by operating activities increased for CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of the increased earnings discussed under Results of Operations and less income taxes paid. CILCORP and CILCO benefited from net income tax refunds of $40 million and $20 million, respectively. IPs cash from operations benefited from the 2004 recovery of prepayments related to IP natural gas purchase contracts made in 2003. These benefits in 2004 were partially offset at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, and CILCO by the pension contribution. IPs cash from operations was negatively affected by the timing of IPs income tax reimbursements to Dynegy and the effect of the acquisition on tax payments to Dynegy. Taxes paid at IP in 2004 benefited from debt redemption premiums and accelerated tax depreciation resulting from the acquisition. Gencos cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of the differences in the timing and amount of income tax payments and the increased pension contributions. These decreases were partially offset by increased electric margins. Pension Funding Amerens 2004 and 2005 contributions to the defined benefit retirement plan qualified trusts, among other things, provided cost savings, because they mitigate future benefit cost increases. In addition, the contribution in 2004 allowed us to avoid paying a portion of the insurance premium to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Trust Corporation. Federal interest rate relief expired December 31, 2005. Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2005, and assuming continuation of the recently expired federal interest rate relief beyond 2006, in order to maintain minimum funding levels for Amerens pension plans, we do not expect future contributions to be required until 2011 at which time we would expect a required contribution of $100 million to $150 million. If federal interest rate relief is not continued in its most recent form, $200 million to $300 million may need to be funded in 2009 to 2010 based on other recent federal legislative proposals. We expect UEs, CIPS, Gencos, CILCOs and IPs portion of the future funding requirements to be approximately 64%, 10%, 10%, 9% and 7%, respectively. These amounts are estimates and may change with actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in government regulations, and any prior voluntary contributions. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2005 versus 2004 Amerens decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily because of $443 million used to acquire IP in 48 Table of Contents 2004. That decrease was partially offset by a $97 million increase in capital expenditures reflecting a full year of IP capital expenditures in 2005 compared to three months of IP expenditures in 2004, and increased capital expenditures at UE discussed below. UEs cash used in investing activities increased in 2005 primarily because UE spent $237 million to purchase 550 megawatts of CTs from Genco and $25 million for a 117 megawatt CT from Development Company. Excluding the CT acquisitions, UEs capital expenditures in 2005 were consistent with 2004. UE maintained consistent plant expenditures by allocating fewer resources to projects at its coal fired plants due to $221 million of expenditures at the Callaway nuclear plant for planned upgrades during a refueling and maintenance outage. CIPS increase in cash used in investing activities in 2005 over 2004 was due to an $18 million increase in capital expenditures and a $72 million reduction in cash received from principal payments on a note receivable from Genco. The increased capital expenditures were used to improve the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems. Gencos cash provided by investing activities increased in 2005 over 2004, because of the sale of 550 megawatts of CTs at Pinckneyville and Kinmundy, Illinois, to UE for $241 million. These proceeds were partially offset by increased capital expenditures for upgrades at one of its power plants in 2005. CILCORPs and CILCOs cash used in investing activities decreased in 2005 from 2004, primarily because CILCORP and CILCO reduced capital expenditures and received proceeds of $13 million from the sale of leveraged leases. In 2004, AERG made capital expenditures for significant power plant upgrades to increase fuel supply flexibility for power generation. IPs cash provided by investing activities in 2005 increased primarily because of proceeds of $140 million for repayments of advances of $140 million that were made to the money pool by IP in 2004. Intercompany Transfer of Illinois Service Territory On May 2, 2005, UE completed the transfer of its Illinois based electric and natural gas service territory to CIPS, at a net book value of $133 million. UE transferred 50% of the assets directly to CIPS in consideration for a CIPS subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of $67 million and 50% of the assets by means of a dividend in kind to Ameren, followed by a capital contribution by Ameren to CIPS. Leveraged Lease Sales In December 2005, Ameren, CILCORP, and CILCO generated proceeds of $54 million, $13 million, and $13 million, respectively, from the sale of certain leveraged leases. Prior to the sale, CILCORP transferred certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries that hold leveraged leases to Resources Company and AERG in exchange for a note receivable. Additionally, an indirect subsidiary of CILCORP that owned leveraged leases was transferred to AERG in exchange for a note receivable. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements, under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the Illinois service territory asset transfer and the leveraged lease sales. 2004 versus 2003 Cash used in investing activities increased for Ameren, UE, CILCORP and CILCO and decreased for Genco in 2004. Included in Amerens cash used in investing activities was $443 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of IP and Dynegys 20% interest in EEI in 2004 and $479 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of CILCORP and Medina Valley in 2003. Excluding the cash paid for acquisitions in 2004 and 2003, Amerens cash used in investing activities increased in 2004, primarily because of increased capital expenditures, discussed below, at UE, CILCORP, and CILCO, and the addition of IPs capital expenditures after the acquisition date. CIPS cash provided by investing activities increased in 2004 from 2003, principally because of increased cash receipts related to the intercompany note receivable from Genco. CIPS cash flows provided by investing activities also increased because capital expenditures were lower in 2004 than in 2003. Gencos cash used in investing activities decreased, principally because capital expenditures were lower in 2004 than in 2003. IPs cash used in investing activities increased principally because of advances made to the utility money pool in 2004. Capital Expenditures The following table presents the capital expenditures by the Ameren Companies for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003: Capital Expenditures 2005 2004 2003 Ameren(a) $ 947 $ 806 $ 682 UE 787 524 480 CIPS 64 46 50 Genco 76 50 58 CILCORP(b) 107 125 87 CILCO 107 125 87 IP(c) 132 135 126 49 Table of Contents (a) Excludes amounts for IP before the acquisition date of September 30, 2004; excludes amounts for CILCORP before the acquisition date of January 31, 2003; and includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (b) The 2003 amount includes January 2003 predecessor information of $16 million. CILCORP consolidates CILCO and therefore includes CILCO amounts in its balances. (c) The 2003 amount represents predecessor information. The 2004 amounts include $100 million incurred prior to the acquisition date of September 30, 2004. Amerens and UEs capital expenditures for 2005 principally consisted of $221 million for steam generators, low pressure rotor replacements, and other upgrades during the 2005 refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant. Ameren and UE also incurred expenditures of $65 million for three CTs at its Venice plant, $60 million for numerous projects at its generating plants, and $45 million for various upgrades to its transmission and distribution system. In addition, UE incurred expenditures of $237 million for CTs purchased from Genco as discussed above. CILCORP and CILCO capital expenditures included $29 million for ongoing generation plant projects to improve flexibility in future fuel supply for power generation. In addition, CILCO, CIPS, and IP incurred expenditures to maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of their transmission and distribution systems. Amerens capital expenditures for 2004 were made principally for various upgrades at UEs power plants, including the replacement of condenser bundles, and other upgrades during the 2004 refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant. The replacement and upgrade work at UEs Callaway plant resulted in capital expenditures of $40 million in 2004. In addition, UE incurred costs for steam generators and low pressure rotors that were replaced during the 2005 refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant. UE also incurred capital expenditures related to the installation of new CTs at its Venice plant and replacement of turbines at two of its power plants in 2004. In addition, UEs capital expenditures included environmental and other upgrades at its power plants and expenditures incurred for new transmission and distribution lines. CILCORPs and CILCOs capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily related to power plant projects to improve flexibility in future fuel supply for power generation. Gencos 2004 capital expenditures were primarily attributed to the replacement of a turbine generator at one of its power plants. Capital expenditures at IP and CIPS consisted of numerous projects to upgrade and maintain the reliability of their respective electric and gas transmission and distribution systems and to add new customers to the systems. Amerens capital expenditures for 2003 principally related to various upgrades at UEs and Gencos coal fired power plants, NOx reduction equipment expenditures at CILCOs generating plants, replacements and improvements to the existing electric transmission and distribution system and natural gas distribution system, and construction costs for CTs at UE. The following table estimates the capital expenditures that will be incurred by the Ameren Companies from 2006 through 2010, including construction expenditures, capitalized interest and allowance for funds used during construction (except for Genco, which has no allowance for funds used during construction) and estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental standards: 2006 2007 2010 Total Ameren(a)(b) $ 1,225 $ 3,805 $ 5,250 $ 5,030 $ 6,475 UE(b) 790 1,660 2,290 2,450 3,080 CIPS 75 275 380 350 455 Genco 95 675 935 770 1,030 CILCO 110 435 605 545 715 IP 150 600 825 750 975 (a) Includes amounts for nonregistrant Ameren subsidiaries. (b) Includes $290 million for the purchase of 1,490 megawatts of CTs. UEs estimated capital expenditures include transmission, distribution and generation related activities, as well as expenditures for compliance with new environmental regulations discussed below. UEs 2006 capital expenditures will satisfy its commitment, as part of UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement, to make between $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion of infrastructure investments during the period January 1, 2002 to June 30, 2006, including the addition of 700 megawatts of generation capacity. The new capacity requirement was satisfied by the addition of 240 megawatts of CTs in 2002 and the transfer from Genco to UE of 550 megawatts of CTs at Pinckneyville and Kinmundy, Illinois, discussed above. In addition, commitments totaling at least $15 million for gas infrastructure improvements between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2006, were agreed upon as part of UEs 2003 Missouri gas rate case settlement. In December 2005, UE entered into separate agreements to purchase CTs with 1,490 total megawatts of capacity for a total of $290 million. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of UE and IP regulatory proceedings related to capital expenditures and UEs agreements to purchase CTs. CIPS and CILCOs estimated capital expenditures are primarily for transmission and distribution related activities. Gencos estimated capital expenditures are primarily for upgrades to existing coal and gas fired generating facilities and compliance with new environmental regulations. CILCOs estimate also includes capital expenditures for generation related activities, as well as for compliance with new environmental regulations at AERGs generating facilities. 50 Table of Contents IPs estimated capital expenditures in 2006 include energy infrastructure improvements that will satisfy Amerens commitment to the ICC to spend $275 million to $325 million through 2006, and other upgrades to the transmission and distribution system. We continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs. As a result, we could modify our plan for generation capacity, which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and whether capacity may be purchased, among other things. Any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material. Environmental Capital Expenditures In May 2005, the EPA issued final regulations with respect to SO2 and NOx emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions (the Clean Air Mercury Rule) from coal fired power plants. The new rules will require significant additional reductions in these emissions from UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI power plants in phases, beginning in 2009. The Clean Air Act and NOx Budget Trading Program created marketable commodities called allowances. Each allowance gives the owner the right to emit one ton of SO2 or NOx. All existing generating facilities have been allocated allowances that are based on past production and the statutory emission reduction goals. If additional allowances are needed for new generating facilities, they can be purchased from facilities that have excess allowances or from allowance banks. Our generating facilities comply with the SO2 limits through the use and purchase of allowances, the use of low sulfur fuels, and through the application of pollution control technology. The NOx Budget Trading Program limits emissions of NOx during the ozone season (May through September). The NOx Budget Trading Program applies to all electric generating units in Illinois beginning in 2004; it applies to all electric generating units in the eastern third of Missouri, where UEs coal fired power plants are located, beginning in 2007. Our generating facilities are expected to comply with the NOx limits through the use and purchase of allowances or through the application of pollution control technology, including low NOx burners, over fire air systems, combustion optimization, rich reagent injection, selective noncatalytic reduction and selective catalytic reduction systems. As of December 31, 2005, UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI held 1.92 million, 0.70 million, 0.34 million, and 0.37 million tons, respectively, of SO2 emission allowances with vintages from 2005 to 2016. Each company possesses additional allowances for use in periods beyond 2016. As of December 31, 2005, UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI Illinois facilities held 272 tons, 11,977 tons, 2,178 tons and 2,859 tons, respectively, of NOx emission allowances with vintages from 2005 to 2008. As of December 31, 2005, the SO2 and NOx emission allowances for UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI were carried in inventory at a book value of $62 million, $79 million, $58 million and $42 million, respectively. The Illinois EPA has not yet issued any NOx emission allowance allocations for 2007 and 2008. UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI expect to use a substantial portion of the SO2 and NOx allowances for ongoing operations. Allocations of NOx allowances for UEs Missouri facilities will be 10,178 tons per season in 2007 and 2008, according to rules finalized in May 2005. New environmental regulations, including the Clean Air Interstate Rule as discussed below, the timing of the installation of pollution control equipment, and the level of operations will have a significant impact on the amount of allowances actually required for ongoing operations. The Clean Air Interstate Rule requires a reduction in SO2 emissions by requiring a change in the way Acid Rain Program allowances are surrendered. The current Acid Rain Program requires the surrender of one SO2 allowance for every ton of SO2 that is emitted. The CAIR program will require that SO2 allowances be surrendered at a ratio of 2 allowances for every ton of emission in 2010 through 2014. Beginning in 2015, SO2 allowances will be surrendered at a ratio of 2.86 allowances for every ton of emission. States are required to finalize rules to implement the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule by September and November 2006 respectively. While the federal rules mandate a specific emissions cap for SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions by state from utility boilers, the states have considerable flexibility in allocating emission allowances to individual utility boilers. In addition, a state may choose to hold back certain emission allowances for growth or other reasons, and it may implement a more stringent program than the federal program. Illinois and Missouri are developing proposed rules that will be subjected to public review and comment. We do not expect the state regulations to be finalized until late 2006. In January 2006, the Illinois governor recommended that the Illinois EPA adopt rules for mercury significantly stricter than the federal rules. The process by which these rules will be drafted and determined is still in its early stages, but should such rules be adopted, it would change our overall environmental compliance strategy for our coal fired power plants and increase related costs from previous estimates. An implementation plan from Missouri regulators is still under review and consideration. The table below presents preliminary estimated capital costs based on current technology for the Ameren system to comply with the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule. Estimates for 2006 to 2010 are included in the estimated 51 Table of Contents capital expenditures above. The timing of estimated capital costs between periods at UE will be influenced by whether excess emission credits are used to comply with the proposed rules, thereby deferring capital investment. 2006 2007 2010 2011 2016 Total Ameren $ 75 $ 1,020 $ 1,405 $ 1,015 $ 1,400 $ 2,110 $ 2,880 UE 60 365 505 750 1,040 1,175 1,605 Genco 10 430 595 10 20 450 625 CILCO 5 175 245 145 200 325 450 EEI 5 55 75 130 180 190 260 See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of environmental matters. Cash Flows from Financing Activities 2005 versus 2004 Cash used in financing activities increased for Ameren in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of a $1 billion decrease in proceeds from common stock issuances in 2005 compared to 2004. The common stock proceeds in 2004 were principally used to fund the acquisition of IP and Dynegys 20% interest in EEI on September 30, 2004, and to repurchase and redeem certain IP indebtedness subsequent to the acquisition. In 2005, total common stock proceeds of $454 million included $345 million from the issuance of 7.4 million shares of common stock related to the settlement of a stock purchase obligation in Amerens adjustable conversion rate equity security units. The 2005 increase in cash used in financing activities was also attributable to $224 million of net redemptions of short term debt compared to net proceeds of $256 million in 2004. Decreased long term debt redemptions of $847 million, increased long term debt issuances of $185 million, and the absence in 2005 of a $67 million UE nuclear fuel lease payment in 2004 partially offset the decrease in cash from financing activities in 2005. UEs cash provided by financing activities increased in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of a $374 million decrease in long term debt redemptions, a $239 million increase in issuances of long term debt, a $35 million decrease in the payment of dividends to Ameren, and the absence of a $67 million nuclear fuel lease payment that was made in 2004. These 2005 benefits in cash from financing activities were partially offset by $295 million used for short term debt repayments; in 2004, UE had net proceeds from short term debt. CIPS cash used in financing activities decreased in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of a $40 million cash benefit from reduced dividends paid to Ameren, and decreased long term debt redemptions of $50 million. These cash benefits were partially offset by decreased issuances of long term debt of $35 million, and net repayments of utility money pool borrowings of $13 million. Gencos cash used in financing activities increased in 2005 from 2004, primarily because of a $225 million long term debt redemption in 2005 and increased payments of $30 million on its note payable to Ameren. The funds for these repayments came from the $241 million in proceeds from the 2005 sale of 550 megawatts of CTs to UE. Net cash used in financing activities also increased because of a capital contribution decrease of $72 million. A reduction of $72 million in payments on a note payable to CIPS and a net increase in non state regulated subsidiary money pool borrowings of $95 million partially offset the additional uses of cash. Effective May 1, 2005, Genco and CIPS amended certain terms of Gencos subordinated affiliate note payable to CIPS by issuing to CIPS an amended and restated subordinated promissory note for $249 million with an interest rate of 7.125% per year, a 5 year amortization schedule, and a maturity of May 1, 2010. CILCORPs cash from financing activities benefited from an $88 million increase in proceeds from an intercompany note payable to Ameren and from decreased long term debt redemptions of $41 million. Partially offsetting these increases were an increase in net repayments of money pool borrowings of $33 million and lower long term debt issuances of $19 million. CILCOs increase in cash from financing activities was mainly due to decreased long term debt redemptions of $103 million and increased capital contributions from Ameren of $27 million. Partially offsetting these increases were increased net repayments of utility money pool borrowings of $36 million and increased dividend payments of $10 million. IPs cash used in financing activities increased in 2005 from 2004 primarily because 2004 included an $871 million capital contribution from Ameren. IPs $76 million increase in dividends to Ameren also contributed to IPs increase in cash used in financing activities. These negative items were partially offset by lower redemptions and repurchases of long term debt of $732 million and by $75 million of cash received from utility money pool borrowings. 2004 versus 2003 Cash from financing activities increased for Ameren in 2004 from 2003, principally because of more proceeds from the issuance of common stock, an increase in net short term debt, and lower preferred stock redemptions. Proceeds aggregating $1.3 billion from the issuance of common stock in February 2004 and July 2004 were used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of IP and 52 Table of Contents Dynegys 20% interest in EEI and to reduce IP debt assumed as part of the transaction and to pay related premiums. Proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in 2003 and 2002 were principally used by Ameren to acquire CILCORP in January 2003. Proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in 2004 were also temporarily used to repay a $100 million term loan at CILCO and to repay short term debt totaling $181 million, pending their use for the acquisition and recapitalization of IP. A portion of the short term debt was also used temporarily to fund UEs maturity of long term debt totaling $85 million in December 2004. Amerens increase in cash flows from financing activities was partially offset by increased redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt, and an increase in nuclear fuel lease payments. The issuance of additional common shares and long term debt resulted in an incremental $26 million in capital issuance costs in 2004 compared with 2003. Ameren also paid an additional $69 million in common dividends because more common shares were outstanding in 2004 than in 2003. UEs cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of cash provided by increased net borrowings from the utility money pool and by increased net short term debt. Partially offsetting these sources of cash were decreased long term debt issuances, higher dividends paid to Ameren, and increased nuclear fuel lease payments. CIPS cash used in financing activities increased in 2004 from 2003, principally because CIPS repaid $53 million to the utility money pool arrangement in 2004. CIPS borrowed $121 million from the money pool in 2003. Increased dividend payments of $13 million to Ameren in 2004, compared with 2003, contributed to CIPS increase in cash used in financing activities. Proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in 2004, along with decreased redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long term debt and preferred stock partially offset CIPS increase in cash used in financing activities in 2004. Gencos cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of a capital contribution of $75 million received indirectly from Ameren in 2004. That capital contribution was used to make Gencos prepayment of $75 million of the principal amount outstanding under its intercompany note payable to CIPS. Increased cash from operations allowed Genco to reduce non state regulated subsidiary money pool borrowings in 2004. Gencos dividend payments were higher in 2004 than in 2003. CILCORPs cash from financing activities decreased in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of a $128 million decrease in utility money pool borrowings and a $20 million decrease in intercompany borrowings from Ameren in 2004. A capital contribution from Ameren of $75 million, decreased dividend payments, and increased long term debt issuances helped to offset the decreases in cash from financing activities. CILCOs cash used in financing activities decreased in 2004 from 2003, primarily because of reduced dividend contributions made to CILCORP in 2004 and a $75 million capital contribution received indirectly from Ameren. CILCOs reduction of cash flows used in financing activities was partially offset by reduced borrowings from the utility money pool arrangement in 2004. Cash from financing activities increased for IP in 2004 from 2003, primarily because Amerens fourth quarter capital contributions of $871 million were used to redeem and repurchase long term debt of $700 million and to pay related premiums of $102 million. In 2003, $376 million was used for redemptions of short term debt and long term debt. In 2003, proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and prepaid interest received from an affiliate, which totaled $278 million, partially offset cash used in financing activities. Short term Borrowings and Liquidity Short term borrowings typically consist of commercial paper issuances and drawings under committed bank credit facilities with maturities of 1 to 45 days. See Note 5 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. The following table presents the various committed bank credit facilities of Ameren and EEI as of December 31, 2005: Credit Facility Expiration Amount Committed Amount Available Ameren:(a) Multiyear revolving(b) July 2010 $ 1,150 $ 960 Multiyear revolving July 2010 350 350 EEI: One bank credit facility April 2006 20 20 Total $ 1,520 $ 1,330 (a) Ameren Companies may access these credit facilities through intercompany borrowing arrangements. (b) UE, CIPS, CILCO, Genco and IP are also direct borrowers under this agreement. 53 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005, Ameren had two committed bank credit facilities totaling $1.5 billion. The committed bank credit facilities are used to support our commercial paper programs. At December 31, 2005, Ameren and UE had $190 million and $80 million, respectively, ($413 million and $375 million for Ameren and UE, respectively, in 2004) of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, which reduced the available amounts under these facilities. Accordingly, $1.31 billion was available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short term borrowing authorizations, by UE, CIPS, CILCO, IP and Ameren Services through a utility money pool agreement. One of these facilities, totaling $1.15 billion, in addition to being fully available to Ameren, may also be directly borrowed under by UE up to $500 million on a 364 day basis, and by CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP up to $150 million each also on a 364 day basis. These facilities were also available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short term borrowing authorizations, by Ameren directly, by CILCORP and EEI through direct short term borrowings from Ameren, and by most of Amerens non rate regulated subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Ameren Services, Resources Company, Genco, Marketing Company, AFS, AERG and Ameren Energy, through a non state regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to coordinate and to provide for certain short term cash and working capital requirements. Separate money pools are maintained for utility and non state regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services enables IP to make short term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money pool agreement, together with any outstanding external short term borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500 million pursuant to authorization from the ICC (such authorization also exists under PUHCA 1935). Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the agreements. See Note 14 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement. Amerens short term debt balance includes $3 million and $4 million of borrowings at a nonregistrant subsidiary at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Access to our credit facilities for all Ameren Companies is subject to reduction based on use by affiliates. In addition to committed credit facilities, a further source of liquidity for Ameren from time to time is available cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2005, Ameren had $96 million of cash and cash equivalents. UE is authorized under PUHCA 1935 to have an aggregate of up to $1 billion of short term unsecured debt instruments outstanding at any time. In addition, CIPS and CILCO have PUHCA 1935 authority to have an aggregate of up to $250 million each of short term unsecured debt instruments outstanding at any time. With the repeal of PUHCA 1935 in February 2006, the issuance of short term debt securities by Amerens public utility subsidiaries is now subject to approval by FERC under the Federal Power Act. Accordingly, UE, CIPS and CILCO are seeking short term debt authority from FERC under the Federal Power Act. Pending receipt of an order approving their financing request, the legislation repealing PUHCA 1935 permits UE, CIPS and CILCO to continue to rely upon their current SEC authorization under PUHCA 1935 until not later than December 31, 2007. Genco is authorized by FERC to have up to $300 million of short term debt outstanding at any time. Genco is seeking a renewal of that authorization. IP and EEI have blanket short term debt authorization from FERC. With the repeal of PUHCA 1935 in February 2006, the issuance of short term unsecured debt securities by Ameren and CILCORP, which was previously subject to SEC approval under PUHCA 1935, is no longer subject to approval by any regulatory body. The Ameren Companies continually evaluate adequacy and appropriateness of their credit arrangements given changing business conditions. When business conditions warrant, changes may be made to existing credit agreements or other short term borrowing arrangements. 54 Table of Contents Long term Debt and Equity The following table presents the issuances of common stock and the issuances, redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt and preferred stock (net of any issuance discounts and including any redemption premiums) for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 for the Ameren Companies, Medina Valley, and EEI.

Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at Amerens option, newly issued shares or treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Ameren is also currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under certain of its 401(k) plans pursuant to effective SEC Form S 8 registration statements. Under DRPlus and its 401(k) plans, Ameren issued 2.1 million, 2.3 million, and 2.5 million shares of common stock in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, which were valued at $109 million, $107 million, and $105 million for the respective years. 56 Table of Contents Ameren, UE and CIPS may sell all or a portion of the remaining securities registered under their effective registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant such a sale. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants See Note 5 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the covenants and provisions contained in Amerens and EEIs bank credit facilities. Also see Note 6 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions contained in certain of the Ameren Companies indenture agreements and articles of incorporation. Our credit agreements contain indebtedness cross default provisions that could trigger a default under the facilities. In the event that Amerens subsidiaries (subject to the definition in the underlying credit agreements), other than certain project finance subsidiaries, default in indebtedness of $50 million or greater, fail to pay the amounts drawn (as a direct borrower) under an Ameren credit facility, or enter bankruptcy proceedings, a default under the Ameren credit facilities would occur. A CILCO bankruptcy would also cause a default under CILCORPs debt agreements. In addition, a default of $50 million or greater or a bankruptcy would cause a default under the International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements supporting $100 million of Ameren LIBOR swaps. At December 31, 2005, the Ameren Companies were in compliance with their credit agreement, indenture, and articles of incorporation provisions and covenants. We consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows. Our inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses. After assessing our current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets. Such events might increase our cost of capital or adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. Dividends Common Dividends Ameren paid to its shareholders common stock dividends totaling $511 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2005, $479 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2004, and $410 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2003. This resulted in a payout rate based on net income of 84%, 90% and 78% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Dividends paid to common shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the same periods were 44%, 42% and 40%, respectively. The amount and timing of dividends payable on Amerens common stock are within the sole discretion of Amerens board of directors. The board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends. However, the board considers various issues, including Amerens historic earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, projected cash flow and potential cash flow requirements, dividend payout rates at other utilities, return on investments with similar risk characteristics, and overall business considerations. On February 10, 2006, Amerens board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 63.5 cents per share payable on March 31, 2006, to shareholders of record on March 8, 2006. Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the Ameren Companies payment of dividends. UE would experience restrictions on dividend payments if it were to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures. CIPS articles of incorporation require its dividend payments to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Gencos indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making any dividend payments if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold. CILCORP has dividend payment restrictions if leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met or if CILCORPs senior long term debt does not have the ratings described in its indenture. CILCO has restrictions in its Articles of Incorporation on dividend payments relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock and amounts to be set aside for any sinking fund retirement of its 5.85% Series preferred stock. At December 31, 2005, none of the conditions described above that would restrict the payment of dividends existed. In its approval of the acquisition of IP by Ameren, the ICC issued an order that permits IP to pay dividends on its common stock subject to certain conditions related to credit ratings of IP and Ameren and the elimination of IPs 11.50% mortgage bonds. Given the current credit ratings of IP and the amount of IPs 11.50% mortgage bonds that remain outstanding, IPs payment of dividends on its common stock was restricted to $80 million in 2005 and is restricted to $160 million cumulatively through 2006. In addition, in accordance with the order issued by the ICC, IP will establish a dividend policy comparable to that of 57 Table of Contents Amerens other Illinois utilities and consistent with achieving and maintaining a common equityto total capitalization ratio between 50% and 60%. The following table presents dividends paid by Ameren Corporation and by Amerens subsidiaries to their respective parents. 2005 2004 2003 UE $ 280 $ 315 $ 288 CIPS 35 75 62 Genco 88 66 36 CILCORP(a) 30 18 27 IP(b) 76 (b ) Ameren (parent) (3 ) Nonregistrants 2 5 Dividends paid by Ameren $ 511 $ 479 $ 410 (a) Before February 2003, CILCORPs dividends would have been paid to AES. These amounts are excluded from the total dividends paid to Ameren. (b) Before October 2004, the ICC prohibited IP from paying dividends. If permitted, IPs dividends would have been paid directly to Illinova and indirectly to Dynegy. Preferred Dividends Certain of the Ameren Companies have issued preferred stock on which they are obligated to make preferred dividend payments. Each companys board of directors declares the preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which it is payable and the amount that will be paid. See Note 10 Stockholder Rights Plan and Preferred Stock to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred stock issuances. Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding Amerens, UEs and IPs capital expenditure commitments related to UEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement, UEs 2004 Missouri gas rate case settlement, and Amerens acquisition of IP. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding expected minimum funding levels for our pension plan.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2005, none of the Ameren Companies had any off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future. Credit Ratings The following table presents the principal credit ratings of the Ameren Companies by Moodys, S&P and Fitch effective on the date of this report: Moodys S&P Fitch Ameren: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa1 BBB+ N/A Unsecured debt Baa1 BBB A Commercial paper P 2 A 2 F2 UE: Secured debt A1 BBB+ A+ Commercial paper P 1 A 2 F1 CIPS: Secured debt A3 A A Genco: Unsecured debt Baa2 BBB+ BBB+ CILCORP: Unsecured debt Baa3 BBB BBB+ CILCO: Secured debt A3 A A IP: Secured debt Baa2 BBB+ BBB 59 Table of Contents On September 30, 2005, Moodys placed the long term credit ratings of Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP under review for possible downgrade. On December 15, 2005, Moodys downgraded Amerens senior unsecured debt and issuer credit ratings from A3 to Baa1, CIPS senior secured debt rating from A1 to A3, CILCORPs senior unsecured debt rating from Baa2 to Baa3, CILCOs senior secured debt rating from A2 to A3, and IPs senior secured debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2, among other ratings downgrades. These ratings remain under review for possible downgrade. In addition, Moodys also placed under review for possible downgrade Amerens P 2 commercial paper rating and UEs long term debt, preferred stock, and commercial paper ratings. All of these ratings actions were undertaken principally because of recent unfavorable actions by the Illinois governor with respect to CIPS, CILCO and IP electric rates in 2007. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for a more detailed discussion of actions by the Illinois governor and others. On October 3, 2005, S&P downgraded the Ameren Companies long term corporate credit ratings from A to BBB+ and Amerens senior unsecured debt from BBB+ to BBB, the secured debt ratings at UE and IP, both from A to BBB+, Gencos senior unsecured debt from A to BBB+ and CILCORPs senior unsecured debt from BBB+ to BBB, among other ratings downgrades. S&P also placed all of the Ameren Companies ratings under negative credit watch. These downgrades were also principally a result of recent unfavorable actions by the Illinois governor with respect to CIPS, CILCO and IP electric rates in 2007. As of March 1, 2006, Fitch had not made any changes to ratings or outlooks for the Ameren Companies. Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital. It may also increase the cost of borrowing and power supply, among other things, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. For example, if at December 31, 2005, the Ameren Companies had a sub investment grade rating (less than BBB or Baa3), Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO or IP could have been required to post collateral for certain trade obligations amounting to $123 million, $31 million, $3 million, less than $1 million, $13 million, $13 million, or $25 million, respectively. In addition, the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can increase or decrease with credit ratings. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. It should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. OUTLOOK Below are some key trends that may affect the Ameren Companies financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in 2006 and beyond: Revenues By the end of 2006, electric rates for Amerens operating subsidiaries will have been fixed or declining for periods ranging from 15 years to 25 years. In 2006, electric rate adjustment moratoriums and power supply contracts expire in Amerens regulatory jurisdictions. Approximately 11 million megawatthours supplied annually by Genco and 6 million megawatthours supplied annually by AERG have been subject to contracts to provide CIPS and CILCO, respectively, with power. The prices in these power supply contracts of $34.00 per megawatthour for AERG and $38.50 per megawatthour for Genco were below estimated market prices for similar contracts in early 2006. Most of Gencos other wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements also expire during 2006 and substantially all of these are below market prices for similar contracts in early 2006. In January 2006, the ICC approved a framework for CIPS, CILCO and IP to procure power for use by their customers in 2007 through an auction. This approval is subject to rehearing and appeal. Certain Illinois legislators, the Illinois attorney general, the Illinois governor, and other parties have sought and continue to seek various methods, including legislation, to block the power procurement auction and or the recovery of related costs for power supply resulting from the auction through rates to customers. Any decision or action that impairs CIPS, CILCOs and IPs ability to fully recover purchased power costs from their electric customers in a timely manner could result in material adverse consequences for these companies and for Ameren. CIPS, CILCO and IP are willing to work to ease the burden of higher energy prices on residential customers through a rate increase phase in plan, as long as such plan allows for the full and timely recovery of costs and does not adversely impact credit ratings. The Ameren Illinois utilities filed proposed new tariffs with the ICC in December 2005 that would increase revenues from electric delivery services, effective January 2, 2007, by $156 million (CIPS $14 million, CILCO $33 million, IP $109 million) per year commencing in 2007 and an additional $46 million (CILCO $10 million, IP $36 million per year) per year commencing in 2008. These proposed tariffs are subject to the approval of the ICC, which is expected to rule by November 2006. See Note 3 Rate and 60 Table of Contents Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. In accordance with an August 2002 MoPSC order, UE submitted a confidential cost of electric service study to the MoPSC staff and others in December 2005. The study was based on a test year ending June 30, 2005. This cost of electric service study submission did not constitute an electric rate adjustment request, and UE has not decided when it will file to adjust electric rates in Missouri. Several factors will influence the decision, including determining the appropriate test year to use in a potential rate filing to set future rates, economic and energy market conditions, expected generating plant additions, and the status of the rulemaking proceeding at the MoPSC for fuel, purchased power and environmental cost recovery mechanisms, among other things. The MoPSC staff and other stakeholders will review UEs cost of service study and, after their analyses, may also make recommendations as to electric rate adjustments. We expect continued economic growth in our service territory to benefit energy demand in 2006 and beyond, but higher energy prices could result in reduced demand from consumers. UE, Genco and CILCO are seeking to raise the equivalent availability and capacity factors of their power plants through a process improvement program. In 2006, we expect natural gas and coal prices to support power prices below 2005 levels. However, very volatile power prices in the Midwest affect the amount of revenues UE, Genco and CILCO (through AERG) can generate by marketing power into the wholesale and interchange markets and influence the cost of power we purchase in the interchange markets. On April 1, 2005, the MISO Day Two Energy Market began operating. The MISO Day Two Energy Market presents an opportunity for increased power sales from UE, Genco and CILCO power plants and improved access to power for UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. Fuel and Purchased Power In 2005, 86% of Amerens electric generation (UE 80%, Genco 93%, CILCO 99%) was supplied by its coal fired power plants. About 85% of the coal used by these plants (UE 97%, Genco 66%, CILCO 26%) was delivered by railroads from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. In May 2005, the joint Burlington Northern Union Pacific rail line in the Powder River Basin suffered two derailments due to unstable track conditions. As a result, the Federal Rail Administration placed slow orders, or speed restrictions, on sections of the line until the track could be made safe. In addition, large sections of track on a Union Pacific rail line were damaged by heavy rains near Topeka, Kansas, in October 2005. These actions reduced deliveries of coal from Powder River Basin mines. Because of the railroad delivery problems, UE, Genco and CILCO received only about 90% to 95% of scheduled deliveries of Powder River Basin coal in 2005. The impact of the coal delivery issues on inventory levels was exacerbated by warm summer weather and high power prices, which caused UE, Genco and CILCO plants to run more and to burn record amounts of coal. Maintenance on the rail lines into the Powder River Basin is expected to continue in 2006, but to have less of an impact on deliveries. Further disruptions in coal deliveries could cause UE, Genco and CILCO to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low margin periods, utilizing higher cost fuels to generate required electricity and purchasing power. Due to higher energy and transportation costs, Amerens coal and related transportation costs are expected to increase 10% to 15% in 2006 and an additional 15% to 20% in 2007. In addition, power generation from higher cost gas fired plants is expected to increase in the next few years. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for 2006 through 2010. The MISO Day Two Energy Market resulted in significantly higher MISO related costs in 2005. In part, these higher charges were due to volatile summer weather patterns and related loads. In addition, we attribute some of these higher charges to the relative infancy of the MISO Day Two Energy Market, suboptimal dispatching of power plants, and price volatility. We will continue to optimize our operations and work closely with MISO to ensure that the MISO Day Two Energy Market operates more efficiently and effectively in the future. In July 2005, a new law was enacted that will enable the MoPSC to put in place fuel, purchased power, and environmental cost recovery mechanisms for Missouri utilities. The legislation also includes rate case filing requirements, a 2.5% annual rate increase cap for the environmental recovery mechanism, and prudency reviews, among other things. Detailed rules for these mechanisms are expected to be issued by the MoPSC in 2006. Other Costs In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydro electric facility. This resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which damaged a state park. UE has hired outside experts to review the cause of the 61 Table of Contents incident. Additionally, the incident is being investigated by FERC and by state authorities. UE expects the results of these reviews later in 2006. The facility will remain closed until these reviews are concluded, further analyses are completed, and input is received from key stakeholders as to how and whether to rebuild the facility. At this time, UE believes that substantially all of the damage and liabilities caused by the breach will be covered by insurance. Under UEs insurance policies, all claims by UE are subject to review by its insurance carriers. The Taum Sauk incident is expected to reduce Amerens and UEs 2006 pretax earnings by $20 million to $35 million as a result of the need to use higher cost sources of power to meet load requirements, reduced interchange sales, and increased expenses. UEs Callaway nuclear plants next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage is in 2007. During an outage, which occurs every 18 months, maintenance and purchased power costs increase, and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases, versus non outage years. Over the next few years, we expect rising employee benefit costs as well as higher insurance and security costs associated with additional measures we have taken, or may need to take, at UEs Callaway nuclear plant and our other facilities. Insurance premiums may also increase as a result of the Taum Sauk incident. We are currently undertaking cost reduction or control initiatives associated with the strategic sourcing of purchases and streamlining of all aspects of our business. Capital Expenditures The EPA has issued more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants. Between 2006 and 2016, Ameren expects that certain Ameren Companies will be required to invest between $2.1 billion and $2.9 billion to retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment. More stringent state regulations could increase these costs. These investments will also result in higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately 55% to 60% of this investment will be in Amerens regulated UE operations, and therefore it is expected to be recoverable over time from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts expended in non rate regulated operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of this increased investment. In December 2005, UE reached agreements to purchase three gas fired CT facilities with a capacity of nearly 1,500 megawatts in transactions valued at $290 million. These transactions are subject to various regulatory agency approvals by state and federal regulators. The purchase of these facilities is designed to meet UEs increased generating capacity needs and to provide additional flexibility in determining future base load generating capacity additions. UE continues to evaluate its longer term needs for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity, but at this time does not expect to require new baseload generation capacity until at least 2015. Affiliate Transactions Due to a MoPSC order issued in conjunction with the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS, UE and Genco amended an agreement to jointly dispatch electric generation in January 2006. In 2005, such an amendment probably would have resulted in a transfer of electric margins from Genco to UE of $35 million to $45 million based on certain assumptions and historical results. Amerens consolidated earnings could be affected when electric rates for UE are adjusted by the MoPSC to reflect the change in revenue. The Missouri OPC intervened in the FERC proceeding considering approval of the proposed amendment and requested that the joint dispatch agreement be further amended to price all transfers at market prices rather than incremental cost, which could transfer additional electric margins from Genco to UE. The ultimate impact of the amendment will be determined by whether the joint dispatch agreement continues to exist, future native load demand, the availability of electric generation from UE and Genco and market prices, among other things, but such impact could be material. See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A and Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 14 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the modification to the joint dispatch agreement ordered by the MoPSC and the further amendments sought by the Missouri OPC in this FERC proceeding. On December 31, 2005, a power supply agreement for UE, CIPS and IP with EEI expired. Power supplied under the agreement by EEI to UE, CIPS and IP was priced at EEIs cost. The expiration of this agreement may require UE, Genco (as a result of its power supply agreement with CIPS) and IP to incur higher fuel or purchased power costs. Power previously supplied under this agreement to UE, CIPS and IP will be sold by Marketing Company at market prices. Market prices in early 2006 were above EEIs cost to produce power. See Note 14 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a further discussion of the EEI power supply agreement. Recent Acquisitions Ameren, CILCORP, CILCO and IP expect to focus on realizing integration synergies associated with these 62 Table of Contents acquisitions, including utilizing more economical fuels at CILCORP and CILCO and reducing administrative and operating expenses at IP. Other In August 2005, President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This legislation includes several provisions that affect the Ameren Companies, including the repeal of PUHCA 1935 (under which Ameren was registered) effective in February 2006, and tax incentives for investments in pollution control equipment, electric transmission property, clean coal facilities, and natural gas distribution lines. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also extends the Price Anderson nuclear plant liability provisions under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The above items could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase Amerens shareholder value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed. The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. REGULATORY MATTERS See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. ACCOUNTING MATTERS Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. Our application of these policies involves judgments regarding many factors which in and of themselves could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. We have outlined below the critical accounting policies that we believe are most difficult, subjective or complex. Any change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results. Accounting Policy Uncertainties Affecting Application Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery All of the Ameren Companies, except Genco, defer costs as regulatory assets in accordance with SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and make investments that they assume will be collected in future rates. Regulatory environment and external regulatory decisions and requirements Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact Impact of deregulation, rate freezes, and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs Basis for Judgment We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. If facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of being recovered, we will record a charge to earnings, which could be material. Environmental Costs We accrue for all known environmental contamination where remediation can be reasonably estimated, but some of our operations have existed for over 100 years and previous contamination may be unknown to us. Extent of contamination Responsible party determination Approved methods for cleanup Present and future legislation and governmental regulations and standards Results of ongoing research and development regarding environmental impacts Basis for Judgment We determine the proper amounts to accrue for known environmental contamination by using internal and third party estimates of cleanup costs in the context of current remediation standards and available technology. 63 Table of Contents Accounting Policy Uncertainties Affecting Application Unbilled Revenue At the end of each period, we project expected usage, and we estimate the amount of revenue to record for services that have been provided to customers but not yet billed. Projecting customer energy usage Estimating impacts of weather and other usage affecting factors for the unbilled period Estimating loss of energy during transmission and delivery Basis for Judgment We base our estimate of unbilled revenue each period on the volume of energy delivered, as valued by a model of billing cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class for our service area. This figure is then adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and weather variations based on historical results. Valuation of Goodwill, Long Lived Assets, and Asset Retirement Obligations We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and long lived assets to determine whether they are impaired. We also review for the existence of asset retirement obligations. If an asset retirement obligation is identified, we determine its fair value and subsequently reassess and adjust the obligation, as necessary. Managements identification of impairment indicators Changes in business, industry, laws, technology, or economic and market conditions Valuation assumptions and conclusions Estimated useful lives of our significant long lived assets Actions or assessments by our regulators Identification of an asset retirement obligation Basis for Judgment Annually, or whenever events indicate a valuation may have changed, we use internal models and third parties to determine fair values. We use various methods to determine valuations, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples, and discounted, undiscounted, and probabilistic discounted cash flow models with multiple scenarios. The identification of asset retirement obligations is conducted through the review of legal documents and interviews. Benefit Plan Accounting Based on actuarial calculations, we accrue costs of providing future employee benefits in accordance with SFAS Nos. 87, 106 and 112, which provide guidance on benefit plan accounting. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations Health care cost trend rates Timing of employee retirements and mortality assumptions Basis for Judgment We use a third party consultant to assist us in evaluating and recording the proper amount for future employee benefits. Our ultimate selection of the discount rate, health care trend rate, and expected rate of return on pension assets is based on our review of available historical, current, and projected rates, as applicable. Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements The FASB has stated it plans to issue an exposure draft on pension and postretirement benefit obligations, in the first quarter of 2006, with the goal of making the provisions of a final standard effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The proposed standard is expected to require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or a liability in the balance sheet, which would include recognition of all previously unrecognized items (such as unrecognized actuarial gains and losses). If approved, this standard could have a material impact on the Ameren Companies financial position. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Nonretail electric rates are regulated by FERC. Our Missouri electric and gas rates were set through June 30, 2006, as part of the settlement of our Missouri electric and gas rate cases. Our Illinois electric rates are legislatively fixed through January 1, 2007. Even without these rate moratoriums, adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that reviews a historical 64 Table of Contents period. As a result, revenue increases will lag behind changing prices. Inflation affects our operations, earnings, stockholders equity, and financial performance. The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers. As a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years. The generation portion of our business in Illinois is principally non rate regulated and therefore does not have regulated recovery mechanisms. In our retail electric utility jurisdictions, we currently have no tariffs for adjusting rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of purchased power. However, in Missouri, the MoPSC is currently developing rules covering the establishment by utilities of fuel and purchased power, and environmental cost recovery mechanisms. In Illinois, the ICC issued an order in January 2006 that would allow the recovery by Illinois electric utilities of purchased power costs directly from customers through a cost recovery mechanism starting in 2007. The ICC order is subject to rehearing and appeal. UE, Genco, CILCORP and CILCO are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent that they must purchase natural gas to run CTs. These companies have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins, to minimize the impact to the financial statements. In our retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, of this report for further information. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument, derivative or non derivative, caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates. The following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. We handle market risks in accordance with established policies, which may include entering into various derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks, principally business, legal and operational risks, are not part of the following discussion. Our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets within prudent risk parameters. Our risk management policies are set by a Risk Management Steering Committee, which is comprised of senior level Ameren officers. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with: long term and short term variable rate debt; fixed rate debt; commercial paper; and auction rate long term debt. We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we hold within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. The following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by 1% on variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2005: Interest Expense Net Income(a) Ameren $ 11 $ (7 ) UE 5 (3 ) CIPS (b ) (b ) Genco 2 (1 ) CILCORP 4 (2 ) CILCO 2 (1 ) IP 4 (3 ) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Less than $1 million. The model does not consider potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would probably act to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted. NYMEX traded futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the NYMEX and have nominal credit risk. On all other transactions, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction. Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables, 65 Table of Contents executory contracts with market risk exposures, and leveraged lease investments. The risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base. At December 31, 2005, no nonaffiliated customer represented greater than 10%, in the aggregate, of our accounts receivable. Our revenues are primarily derived from sales of electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and Illinois. UE, Genco, IP and Marketing Company have credit exposure associated with interchange purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2005, UEs, Gencos, IPs and Marketing Companys combined credit exposure to non investment grade counterparties related to interchange purchases and sales was $39 million, net of collateral (2004 $2 million). We establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program that involves daily exposure reporting to senior management, master trading and netting agreements, and credit support, such as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze each counterpartys financial condition before we enter into sales, forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts, and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged leases. We estimate our credit exposure to MISO associated with the implementation of the MISO Day Two Energy Market on April 1, 2005, to be $26 million at December 31, 2005. Equity Price Risk Our costs of providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the rate of return on plan assets. Ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in ERISA. Amerens goal is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment management to specialists in each asset class. Where appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after an analysis of historical experience, future expectations, and the volatility of the various asset classes. After considering the target asset allocation for each asset class, we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared to benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets. In future years, the costs of such plans reflected in net income or OCI and cash contributions to the plans could increase materially without pension asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 8.5%. UE also maintains a trust fund, as required by the NRC and Missouri law, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning. As of December 31, 2005, this fund was invested primarily in domestic equity securities (66%) and debt securities (34%) and totaled $250 million (2004 $235 million). By maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize the returns to be utilized to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk. However, the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the fixed rate, fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options. UEs exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated, because UE is currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in its electric rates, which would include unfavorable investment results. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, and natural gas. UEs, Gencos, AERGs and EEIs risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements to regulated and unregulated electric customers. We also attempt to mitigate financial risks through structured risk management programs and policies, through structured forward hedging programs, and through derivative financial instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts, and financial swap contracts). A derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value of some underlying asset. CIPS, CILCO and IP have electric rate freezes in Illinois through January 1, 2007, and power supply contracts in place through December 31, 2006. In January 2006, the ICC approved a framework for CIPS, CILCO and IP to procure power for use by their customers in 2007 through a September 2006 auction. The approved framework also allows for full cost recovery of power through a rate mechanism. This approval is subject to rehearing and appeal. UE has an electric rate freeze in Missouri through June 30, 2006, and is also exposed to price risk on its interchange sales. During 2006, Gencos and AERGs electric power supply agreements with CIPS (through Marketing Company) 66 Table of Contents and CILCO, respectively, expire, as do most of Gencos wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements. EEIs power supply agreements with UE and CIPS expired on December 31, 2005. The expiration of these agreements expose Genco, AERG and EEI to price risk for the power they generate and sell. Genco and AERG will likely participate through Marketing Company in the September 2006 Illinois auction. The auction will be structured to allow for one third of CIPS, CILCOs and IPs power needs to be procured each year after all power needs are initially procured in the September 2006 auction subject to an ICC ordered limitation of 35% on the amount of power that can be provided of CIPS, CILCOs, and IPs expected load by any one supplier or group of affiliated suppliers. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for more information on the Illinois power procurement process. As noted above, IP has electric power supply agreements in place through the end of 2006. Should power acquired under these agreements be insufficient to meet IPs load requirements, IP will be required to buy power at market prices. Some purchased power agreements oblige the suppliers to provide power up to the reservation amount, and at the same prices, even if individual units are unavailable at various times. Purchased power agreements with other suppliers do not oblige them to acquire replacement power for us in the event of a curtailment or shutdown of their plants. Any costs not covered by rates could not be passed on to ratepayers, which could have an unfavorable impact on IPs results of operations. With regard to our exposure to commodity price risk for purchased power and market based electricity sales, Ameren has two subsidiaries, Ameren Energy and Marketing Company, whose primary responsibilities include managing market risks associated with changing market prices for electricity purchased and sold on behalf of UE, Genco, CILCO and EEI. Purchases are generally transacted when they are economically beneficial to serve load requirements. Similar techniques are used to manage risks associated with fuel exposures for generation. Most UE, Genco and CILCO fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts. UE, Genco and CILCO do not have a provision similar to the PGA clause for electric operations, so UE, Genco and CILCO have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and nuclear fuel in order to manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility. Price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures, whereby the amount of coal purchased is determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year. We generally purchase coal up to five years in advance, but we may purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable deals or market conditions. The strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions. Transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs. We typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility. The natural gas transportation expenses for the distribution companies and the gas fired generation units are controlled by FERC via published tariffs with rights to extend the contracts from year to year. Depending on our competitive position, we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariffs for our requirements. The following table shows how our total fuel expense might increase and how our net income might decrease if coal and coal transportation costs were to increase by 1% on any requirements not currently covered by fixed price contracts for the five year period 2006 through 2010: Coal Transportation Fuel Expense Net Income(a) Fuel Expense Net Income(a) Ameren $ 11 $ (7 ) $ 10 $ (6 ) UE 6 (4 ) 3 (2 ) Genco 3 (2 ) 4 (3 ) CILCORP 1 (1 ) 2 (1 ) CILCO 1 (1 ) 2 (1 ) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. In the event of a significant change in coal prices, UE, Genco and CILCO would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources. With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel, UE has both fixed priced and base pricewith escalation agreements or inventories to fulfill its Callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services through 2007. UE also has agreements or inventories for 69% of the 2008 to 2010 requirements. UE expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the plant, at prices which cannot now be accurately predicted. UEs strategy is to hedge at least 75% of its three year requirements. This strategy permits optimum timing of new forward contracts, given the relatively long price cycles in the nuclear fuel markets. It also provides security of supply to protect against unforeseen market disruptions. Unlike the electricity and natural gas markets, nuclear fuel markets have no sophisticated financial instruments, so most hedging is done via inventories and forward contracts. With regard to the electric generating operations for UE, Genco and CILCO that are exposed to changes in 67 Table of Contents market prices for natural gas used to run the CTs, the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs. We optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins. Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the advent of the MISO Day Two Energy Market. Marketing Company has acquired FTRs for its participation in the PJM Northern Illinois market. The FTRs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission congestion charges related to our physical electricity business. Depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid, FTRs could result in either charges or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to determine which FTRs we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is a risk that we may incorrectly model the amount of FTRs we will need, and there is the potential that the FTRs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges. With regard to UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs natural gas distribution businesses, exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact there are gas cost recovery mechanisms (PGA clauses) in place in both Missouri and Illinois. These gas cost recovery mechanisms allow UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred costs of natural gas. Our strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations on our regulated natural gas customers. We cannot eliminate the effects of gas price volatility. However, the gas procurement strategy involves risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier, as well as the management of physical assets, including storage and operator and balancing agreements. The following table presents the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired power plants, nuclear fuel for UEs Callaway nuclear plant, natural gas for our CTs and retail distribution, as appropriate, and purchased power needs of CIPS, CILCO and IP, which own virtually no generation, that are price hedged over the five year period 2006 through 2010: 2006 2007 2008 2010 Ameren: Coal 100 % 92 % 55 % Coal transportation 100 93 60 Nuclear fuel 100 100 69 Natural gas for generation 21 10 2 Natural gas for distribution(a) 87 15 5 UE: Coal 100 93 51 Coal transportation 100 98 79 Nuclear fuel 100 100 69 Natural gas for generation 11 7 1 Natural gas for distribution(a) 100 15 6 CIPS: Natural gas for distribution(a) 95 27 13 Purchased power(b) 100 Genco: Coal 100 89 65 Coal transportation 100 89 38 Natural gas for generation 20 19 3 CILCORP: Coal 100 94 53 Coal transportation 100 67 44 Natural gas for distribution(a) 89 24 7 Purchased power(b) 100 CILCO: Coal 100 94 53 Coal transportation 100 67 44 Natural gas for distribution(a) 89 24 7 Purchased power(b) 100 IP: Natural gas for distribution(a) 79 5 1 Purchased power(b) 90 68 Table of Contents (a) Represents the percentage of natural gas price hedged for the peak winter season of November through March.

(b) Beginning in 2007, CIPS, CILCO and IP are expected to purchase all electric capacity and energy through a power procurement process approved by the ICC. See Note 3 Rate and Regulatory Matters for a discussion of this matter. See Supply for Electric Power under Part I, Item 1, of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric and oil. Also see Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. Fair Value of Contracts Most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales. We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity and emission credits. Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel and electricity may cause any of these conditions: an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sales prices under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices; market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power that differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory under contracted commitment; or actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that differ from anticipated cash outlays. The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements. See Note 9 Derivative Financial Instruments to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) changes in the fair value of all derivative contracts marked to market during the year ended December 31, 2005. The sources used to determine the fair value of these contracts were active quotes, other external sources, and other modeling and valuation methods.
