ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Ameren Executive Summary Operations In 2007, we accomplished some key objectives that we believe will bring significant long term benefits to our customers and shareholders. In Illinois, the Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco and AERG reached a comprehensive settlement that will help Ameren Illinois Utilities customers transition to higher electric rates and bring stability to the power procurement process. Rate rollback and freeze legislation in response to higher electric rates in Illinois, driven by deregulation of that market, would have had severe negative operational and financial consequences for Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP, as well as significantly impacted the Ameren Illinois Utilities ability to deliver reliable service to their customers. Major stakeholders involved with this issue, including the Illinois governors office, leaders of the House of Representatives and Senate in Illinois, and the Illinois attorney generals office, agreed to the Illinois electric settlement agreement. As a result, the Illinois electric settlement agreement provides significantly greater levels of legislative, regulatory and legal certainty. It also enables a viable competitive power supply market to continue to develop in Illinois. In late 2007, the Ameren Illinois Utilities requested to increase annual revenues for electric and gas delivery services by $247 million in the aggregate. The Ameren Illinois Utilities also requested ICC approval to implement rate adjustment mechanisms for bad debt expenses, certain electric infrastructure investments and the decoupling of natural gas revenues from sales volumes. The ICC has until the end of September 2008 to render a decision in these rate cases. UE also expects to file an electric rate increase request in Missouri in the second quarter of 2008 to mitigate higher cost and investment levels. Constructive outcomes for the rate cases in Illinois and Missouri are very important to UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP need to recover their costs to continue investing in their energy infrastructure on a timely basis and provide their customers with safe and reliable service. In Missouri, we were able to settle all state and federal issues associated with the December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility. UE has begun rebuilding the upper reservoir and expects the plant to be out of service until the fall of 2009, if not longer. The cost of the rebuild is expected to be in the range of $450 million. UE believes that substantially all damages and liabilities (but not fines and penalties) caused by the breach, including costs related to the settlement agreement with the state of Missouri, the cost of rebuilding the plant, and the cost or replacement power, up to $8 million annually, will be covered by insurance. In February 2008, UE filed an integrated resource plan with the MoPSC. The integrated resource plan outlines support for energy efficiency measures to reduce demand growth, expand renewable generation and increase existing power plant efficiency. Some of UEs coal fired power plants are aging, and an analysis will be completed in 2009 to determine which units are likely candidates for retirement. The integrated resource plan concludes that a new baseload plant is expected to be required in our regulated Missouri operations in the 2018 to 2020 timeframe. For that reason, UE is preserving the option to develop additional nuclear generation, while researching clean coal and carbon sequestration technologies. UE expects to file in 2008 a 28 Table of Contents construction and operating license application with the NRC for a new unit at UEs Callaway nuclear plant site. While this filing will not represent a final decision, it preserves the option to build a nuclear unit. UE will not proceed on any new baseload power plant unless construction costs are recoverable through rates in Missouri. In addition to considering a new unit at Callaway, UE also began the process in 2008 to extend through 2044 the existing unit license at Callaway, which currently expires in 2024. In 2007, Amerens Non rate regulated Generation business segment continued to execute its plan for investing in its power plants to improve their future productivity, as well as to effectively market their generation, consistent with their risk management framework. Non rate regulated Generation has also begun significant work on some of its coal fired plants to begin installing additional environmental controls. Earnings Ameren reported net income of $618 million, or $2.98 per share, for 2007 compared to net income of $547 million, or $2.66 per share, in 2006. Earnings in 2007 principally benefited from, among other things, higher priced power sales contracts in Amerens Non rate regulated Generation business segment, the June 2007 implementation of a Missouri electric rate order and greater demand for electricity and natural gas caused by warmer summer and cooler winter weather than in 2006. Amerens 2007 earnings were reduced by 21 cents per share for the net cost of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Storm related costs in 2006 reduced net income by 26 cents per share. The impact of storm restoration efforts was less in 2007, but still significant. Amerens 2007 earnings were reduced by 9 cents per share as a result of the cost of restoration efforts associated with a severe ice storm in January 2007. In addition, a FERC order retroactively adjusting prior years RTO costs reduced 2007 earnings by 6 cents per share. Other items that unfavorably impacted earnings were, among other things, higher fuel costs and bad debt expenses, lower emission allowance sales, increased expenditures to improve reliability in Amerens regulated business segments and higher depreciation and financing costs due to greater energy infrastructure investment. In addition, there were fewer sales of noncore properties in 2007. Liquidity Cash flows from operations of $1.1 billion in 2007 at Ameren, along with other funds, were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of $527 million and to fund capital expenditures of $1.4 billion. Financing activities in 2007 primarily consisted of refinancing debt and funding capital investment with borrowings under credit facilities. Outlook Over the next few years, we expect to make significant investments in our electric and gas infrastructure to improve the reliability of our distribution systems and to comply with environmental regulations. These investments are consistent with our customers and regulators expectations. We expect that earnings growth in our rate regulated businesses will come from updating existing customer rates to better reflect these investments and the current levels of costs UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities are experiencing. However, in the near term, the returns experienced in 2007 and expected to be experienced in 2008 by UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities are below levels allowed by the respective state utility commissions in their last rate cases. That is due to the fact that UEs and the Ameren Illinois Utilities current rates are significantly below the cost and investment levels they are incurring in their businesses today. In a rising cost environment, earnings will be negatively impacted due to regulatory lag until appropriate levels of rate relief are granted. Our plan to address this shortfall and to achieve earnings growth is very straightforward: UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities will file more frequent rate cases requesting moderate rate increases, as well as seek appropriate cost recovery mechanisms to mitigate regulatory lag. In addition, we will continue to optimize Amerens Non rate regulated Generations assets, focusing on improving the output of these plants and related energy marketing. While we currently believe that rising costs, including fuel, depreciation and financing costs will largely offset these productivity gains, we believe our plants will be well positioned for earnings growth in the future should energy and capacity prices improve. The EPA has issued more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants. Between 2008 and 2017 Ameren expects that certain Ameren Companies will be required to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion to retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment. Costs for these types of projects continue to escalate. These investments will also result in decreased plant availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately 45% of this investment will be in Amerens regulated UE operations, and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers. Future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global warming are subject to active consideration in the U.S. Congress. Ameren believes that currently proposed legislation can be classified as moderate to extreme depending upon proposed CO2 emission limits, the timing of implementation of those limits, and the method of allocating allowances. We support public policy that will result in substantial reductions in CO2 emission. However, CO2 policy must take into account the profound economic implications of moving toward a carbon constrained economy. We believe any legislation should include the following principles in order to limit the negative impact on our customers, economy and company: Recognition of the significant economic impact of greenhouse gas policies on consumers and businesses in regions now dependent on coal. Compliance timelines consistent with development of advanced technologies. 29 Table of Contents Provisions for significant research funding. Provisions for an effective cap and trade program. Allowances for greenhouse gas offsets, such as reforestation. Removal of potential regulatory and financial barriers to improvement in existing infrastructure. Broad based CO2 regulation across all industries. A national and global policy approach. Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. The costs to comply with future legislation or regulations could be so expensive that Ameren and other similarly situated electric power generators may be forced to close some coal fired facilities. Mandatory limits could have a material adverse impact on Amerens, UEs, Gencos, AERGs and EEIs results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. The Ameren Companies will incur significant capital expenditures over the next five years as they comply with environmental regulations and make significant investments in their electric and gas utility infrastructure to improve overall system reliability. Expenditures not funded with operating cash flows are expected to be funded primarily with debt. General Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company. Amerens primary assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries. Amerens subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets and liabilities. These subsidiaries operate rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses, rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution businesses, and non rate regulated electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois, as discussed below. Dividends on Amerens common stock are dependent on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed description of our principal subsidiaries. UE operates a rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution business, and a rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution business in Missouri. Before May 2, 2005, UE also operated those businesses in Illinois. CIPS operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. Genco operates a non rate regulated electric generation business. CILCO, a subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company), operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business and a non rate regulated electric generation business (through its subsidiary, AERG) in Illinois. IP operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are expressed in millions, unless otherwise indicated. In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, we present certain information in cents per share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect Amerens earnings. We believe this per share information helps readers to understand the impact of these factors on Amerens earnings per share. All references in this report to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares outstanding during the applicable year. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Summary Our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations: winter heating and summer cooling demands. The vast majority of Amerens revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. This regulation has a material impact on the price we charge for our services. Non rate regulated Generation sales are also subject to market conditions for power. We principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil in our operations. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the global economic and political environment, weather, supply and demand, and many other factors. We do not currently have a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism in Missouri for our electric utility business. We do have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois and Missouri gas delivery businesses and purchased power cost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois electric delivery businesses. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, for a discussion of pending and recently decided rate cases and the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our cost of borrowing and our pension and postretirement benefits costs. We employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risk and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of our power plants and transmission and distribution systems, the level of purchased power costs, operating and administrative costs, and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Amerens net income was $618 million ($2.98 per share) for 2007, $547 million ($2.66 per share) for 2006, and $606 million ($3.02 per share) for 2005. In 2005, Amerens net income included a net cumulative effect aftertax loss of $22 million (11 cents per share) associated with recording liabilities for conditional AROs as a result of our adoption of FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. The net cumulative effect aftertax 30 Table of Contents loss of adopting FIN 47 is presented below for the applicable registrant companies: 2005 Net Cumulative Effect Aftertax Loss Ameren(a) $ 22 Genco 16 CILCORP 2 CILCO 2 (a) Includes amounts for EEI. Amerens net income increased $71 million and earnings per share increased 32 cents in 2007 compared with 2006. Compared with 2006 earnings, 2007 earnings were favorably affected by: higher margins in the Non rate regulated Generation segment due to the replacement of below market power sales contracts, which expired in 2006, with higher priced contracts; favorable weather conditions (estimated at 14 cents per share); the absence of costs in 2007 that were incurred in 2006 related to the reservoir breach at UEs Taum Sauk plant (15 cents per share); higher electric rates, lower depreciation expense, decreased income tax expense and $5 million in SO2 emission allowance sales in the Missouri Regulated segment pursuant to the MoPSC electric rate order for UE issued in May 2007 (21 cents per share); and decreased costs associated with outages caused by severe storms (17 cents per share). Compared with 2006 earnings, 2007 earnings were negatively affected by: electric rate relief and customer assistance programs provided to certain Ameren Illinois Utilities electric customers under the Illinois electric settlement agreement (21 cents per share) described in Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report; the combined effect of the elimination of the Ameren Illinois Utilities bundled tariffs, implementation of new delivery service tariffs effective January 2, 2007, and the expiration of below market power supply contracts; higher fuel and related transportation prices (31 cents per share); higher labor and employee benefit costs (18 cents per share); increased depreciation and amortization expense (13 cents per share); higher financing costs (17 cents per share); a planned refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant net of an unplanned outage at Callaway in 2006 (9 cents per share); increases in distribution system reliability expenditures (15 cents per share); higher bad debt expenses (8 cents per share); lower emission allowance sales (16 cents per share); and reduced gains on the sale of noncore properties, including leveraged leases (15 cents per share). The cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2006. Amerens net income before cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 47 decreased $81 million and earnings per share decreased 47 cents in 2006 compared with 2005. Compared with 2005 earnings, 2006 earnings were negatively affected by: costs and lost electric margins associated with outages caused by severe storms (26 cents per share); milder weather conditions (estimated at 17 cents per share); costs associated with the reservoir breach at UEs Taum Sauk plant (20 cents per share); an unscheduled outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant (7 cents per share); higher depreciation expense (11 cents per share); increased taxes other than income taxes (8 cents per share); contributions made in association with the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan (5 cents per share); increased fuel and purchased power costs; and higher financing costs. An increase in the number of common shares outstanding also reduced Amerens earnings per share in 2006 compared with 2005. Compared with 2005, earnings in 2006 were favorably affected by: higher margins on interchange sales (33 cents per share); increased net gains on the sale of noncore properties, including leveraged leases, compared with 2005 (9 cents per share); the lack of a refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant in 2006 (18 cents per share); increased sales of emission allowances (5 cents per share); and other factors including improved plant operations, lack of coal conservation efforts, industrial electric customers switching back to the Ameren Illinois Utilities, lower bad debt expenses, and organic growth. The cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2005. 31 Table of Contents Because it is a holding company, Amerens net income and cash flows are primarily generated by its principal subsidiaries: UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP.

Electric margins are defined as electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. Gas margins are defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale. The table covers the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. We consider electric, interchange and gas margins useful measures to analyze the change in profitability of our electric and gas operations between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information we provide in accordance with GAAP. However, these margins may not be a presentation defined under GAAP, and they may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we provide elsewhere in this report. 2007 versus 2006 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO IP Electric revenue change: Effect of weather (estimate) $ 73 $ 31 $ 16 $ $ 9 $ 9 $ 17 UE electric rate increase 29 29 Storm related outages (estimate) 10 9 3 (3 ) 1 JDA terminated December 31, 2006 (196 ) (97 ) Elimination of CILCO/AERG power supply agreement 108 108 108 Interchange revenues, excluding estimated weather impact of ($47) million 252 252 Illinois electric settlement agreement, net of reimbursement (73 ) (11 ) (30 ) (20 ) (20 ) (14 ) FERC ordered MISO resettlements March 2007 17 12 4 4 Mark to market losses on energy contracts (21 ) (13 ) Illinois rate redesign, generation repricing, growth and other (estimate) 287 11 36 (2 ) 160 160 (49 ) Total electric revenue change $ 682 $ 123 $ 44 $ (120 ) $ 261 $ 261 $ (45 ) Fuel and purchased power change: Fuel: Generation and other $ (35 ) $ (10 ) $ $ (48 ) $ 22 $ 21 $ Emission allowance sales (costs) (38 ) (29 ) 14 11 Mark to market gains (losses) on fuel contracts 23 9 6 1 1 Price (98 ) (84 ) (5 ) (5 ) (5 ) JDA terminated December 31, 2006 97 196 Purchased power (90 ) (25 ) (48 ) 101 (120 ) (119 ) 35 Entergy Arkansas, Inc. power purchase agreement (12 ) (12 ) Elimination of CILCO/AERG power supply agreement (108 ) (108 ) (108 ) Insurance recovery 8 20 2 7 7 FERC ordered MISO resettlements March 2007 (35 ) (11 ) (8 ) (4 ) (4 ) (12 ) Storm related energy costs (estimate) (1 ) (2 ) 1 1 Total fuel and purchased power change $ (386 ) $ (47 ) $ (56 ) $ 253 $ (193 ) $ (196 ) $ 24 Net change in electric margins $ 296 $ 76 $ (12 ) $ 133 $ 68 $ 65 $ (21 ) Net change in gas margins $ 15 $ 10 $ 2 $ $ 5 $ 5 $ 1 2006 versus 2005 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO IP Electric revenue change: Effect of weather on native load (estimate) $ (82 ) $ (39 ) $ (16 ) $ $ (10 ) $ (10 ) $ (17 ) Storm related outages (estimate) (10 ) (9 ) (3 ) 3 (1 ) Noranda 46 46 UE Illinois service territory transfer to CIPS (38 ) 41 34 Wholesale contracts (76 ) (76 ) Interchange revenues(b) 236 (26 ) (34 ) (46 ) 8 8 Transmission service and other revenues (32 ) (4 ) 3 2 2 2 (12 ) Growth and other (estimate) 72 27 27 40 12 12 67 Total electric revenue change $ 154 $ (43 ) $ 18 $ (43 ) $ 12 $ 12 $ 37 33 Table of Contents 2006 versus 2005 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO IP Fuel and purchased power change: Fuel: Generation and other $ (29 ) $ 3 $ $ (10 ) $ (3 ) $ $ Emission allowances sales (costs) 28 30 (21 ) 9 8 Price (82 ) (40 ) (18 ) (20 ) (20 ) Purchased power (31 ) 69 (15 ) (10 ) 29 29 (51 ) Storm related energy costs (estimate) 1 2 (1 ) (1 ) Total fuel and purchased power change $ (113 ) $ 64 $ (15 ) $ (60 ) $ 15 $ 17 $ (52 ) Net change in electric margins $ 41 $ 21 $ 3 $ (103 ) $ 27 $ 29 $ (15 ) Net change in gas margins $ (24 ) $ (13 ) $ 1 $ $ (10 ) $ (10 ) $ 1 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (b) The effect of storm related outages increasing interchange revenues is included in the storm related outages (estimate) line. 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Amerens electric margin increased by $296 million, or 9%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Factors contributing to an increase in Amerens electric margin were as follows: More power sold by Non rate regulated Generation at market based prices in 2007. These 2007 sales compared favorably with 2006 sales at below market prices, pursuant to cost based power supply agreements that expired on December 31, 2006. Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 19% increase in cooling degree days, increased electric margin by $35 million. UEs electric rate increase, effective June 4, 2007, which increased electric margin by $29 million. An increase in margin on interchange sales, primarily because of the termination of the JDA on December 31, 2006. This termination of the JDA provided UE with the ability to sell its excess power, originally obligated to Genco under the JDA at cost, in the spot market at higher prices. This increase was reduced by higher purchased power costs of $12 million associated with an agreement with Entergy Arkansas, Inc. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for more information on the UE power purchase agreement with Entergy Arkansas, Inc. A 67% increase in hydroelectric generation because of improved water levels, which allowed additional generation to be used for interchange sales and reduced utilization of higher priced energy sources, increased Amerens electric margin by $27 million. Increased Non rate regulated Generation capacity sales of $11 million. Reduced severe storm related outages in 2007 compared to those that occurred in 2006, which negatively impacted electric sales and resulted in a net reduction in overall electric margin of $9 million in 2006. Insurance recoveries of $8 million related to power purchased to replace Taum Sauk generation. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for more information. Factors contributing to a decrease in electric margin for 2007 as compared with 2006 were as follows: The combined effect on the Ameren Illinois Utilities of the elimination of bundled tariffs, implementation of new delivery service tariffs effective January 2, 2007, and the expiration of below market power supply contracts. A 14% increase in fuel prices. Rate relief and customer assistance programs under the Illinois electric settlement agreement, which reduced electric margin by $73 million. The loss of wholesale margins at Genco from power acquired through the JDA, which terminated in 2006. Decreased emission allowance sales of $53 million, offset by lower emission allowance costs of $15 million. Purchased power costs that were $18 million higher for the year because of a March 2007 FERC order that resettled costs among market participants retroactive to 2005. Reduced plant availability. Amerens baseload nuclear and coal fired generating plants average capacity and equivalent availability factors were approximately 78% and 86%, respectively, in 2007 compared with 80% and 88%, respectively, in 2006. Amerens gas margin increased by $15 million, or 4%, in 2007. The primary causes of the increase were favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by an 8% increase in heating degree days, which increased gas margin by an estimated $10 million, and the UE gas rate increase that went into effect in April 2007, which increased gas margin by $4 million. Missouri Regulated UE UEs electric margin increased $76 million, or 4%, in 2007 compared with 2006. The following items had a favorable impact on UEs electric margin: An increase in margin on interchange sales, primarily because of the termination of the JDA on December 31, 2006. The termination of the JDA allowed UE to sell its 34 Table of Contents excess power, originally obligated to Genco under the JDA at cost, in the spot market at higher prices. This increase was reduced by higher purchased power costs of $12 million associated with an agreement with Entergy Arkansas, Inc. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for more information. The electric rate increase that went into effect June 4, 2007, which increased electric margin by $29 million. A 67% increase in hydroelectric generation because of improved water levels. This allowed additional generation to be used for interchange sales and reduced UEs use of higher priced energy sources, which increased electric margin by $27 million. Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 19% increase in cooling degree days, which increased electric margin by $22 million. Replacement power insurance recoveries of $20 million, including $8 million associated with Taum Sauk. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for more information. Increased transmission service revenues of $18 million due to the ancillary service agreement with CIPS, CILCO, and IP. See Note 12 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for more information. Decreased fuel costs due to the lack of $4 million in fees levied by FERC in 2006 upon completion of its cost study for generation benefits provided to UEs Osage hydroelectric plant, and the May 2007 MoPSC rate order, which directed UE to transfer $4 million of the total fees to an asset account, which is being amortized over 25 years. Reduced severe storm related outages in 2007 compared with 2006, which negatively impacted electric sales that year and resulted in a net reduction in overall electric margin of $7 million in 2006. Items that had an unfavorable impact on electric margin in 2007 as compared with 2006 were as follows: A 21% increase in fuel prices. Decreased emission allowance sales of $29 million. MISO purchased power costs that were $11 million higher due to the March 2007 FERC order. Other MISO purchased power costs, excluding the effect of the March 2007 FERC order, that were $20 million higher. Reduced power plant availability because of planned maintenance activities. UEs baseload nuclear and coal fired generating plants average capacity and equivalent availability factors were approximately 81% and 89%, respectively, in 2007 compared with 84% and 90%, respectively, in 2006. UEs gas margin increased by $10 million, or 17%, in 2007 compared with 2006.

Distribution system reliability expenditures increased $49 million and employee benefits and non Callaway labor costs were higher by $55 million in 2007 compared with 2006. Bad debt expenses increased $25 million in 2007, primarily as a result of the transition to higher electric rates in Illinois. Increases in maintenance at coal fired power plants and injuries and damages reserves also contributed to higher other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007. We recognized reduced gains on sales of noncore property in 2007 of $4 million as compared to gains of $16 million in 2006. Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 included a payment of $4.5 million made to the IPA as part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Reducing the effect of these items was the reversal in 2007 of an accrual of $15 million established in 2006 for contributions to assist customers through the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan. In 2006, we also recognized costs of $25 million related to the December 2005 Taum Sauk plant reservoir breach. Costs associated with storms in the spring and summer of 2006 and a major ice storm in the fourth quarter of 2006 exceeded the costs associated with an ice storm in January 2007 by $42 million, thereby reducing other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 compared with 2006. Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Other operations and maintenance expenses increased in 2007 compared with 2006. Maintenance and labor costs associated with the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2007 added $35 million to other operations and maintenance expenses compared with 2006. Higher distribution system reliability expenditures of $34 million, increased non Callaway related labor costs of $22 million, and insurance premiums of $19 million for replacement power coverage paid to a risk insurance affiliate also increased other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 compared with 2006. Reducing the effect of these items was the absence in 2007 of costs recorded in 2006 related to the Taum Sauk plant reservoir breach as discussed above. Costs associated with storms in the spring and summer of 2006 and a major ice storm in the fourth quarter of 2006 exceeded the costs associated with an ice storm in January 2007 by $13 million, thereby reducing other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 compared with 2006. 40 Table of Contents Illinois Regulated Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $15 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2007 compared with 2006. CIPS Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $11 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of increased bad debt expenses, higher distribution system reliability expenditures, and increased injuries and damages reserves. The reversal in 2007 of the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan accrual of $4 million established in 2006 reduced the effect of these increases. Costs associated with storms in the spring and summer of 2006 and a major ice storm in the fourth quarter of 2006 were comparable with the costs associated with an ice storm in January 2007. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006, as an increase in bad debt expenses was offset by the reversal of the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan accrual of $3 million established in 2006. Costs associated with storms had a minimal impact on CILCO (Illinois Regulated) other operations and maintenance expenses each year. IP IPs other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006. Higher employee benefit costs increased other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007. Bad debt expenses increased $10 million in 2007, primarily as a result of the transition to higher electric rates in Illinois.

We experienced the most damaging storms in the Ameren utilities history in our service territory during the summer of 2006, resulting in the loss of power to about 950,000 electric customers and expenses of $28 million. Severe ice storms in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulted in the loss of power to about 520,000 electric customers and expenses of $42 million. Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses increased because of $25 million in costs related to the December 2005 reservoir breach at UEs Taum Sauk plant and $15 million of contributions to assist residential customers in association with the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan accepted by the ICC in December 2006. In addition, there were higher maintenance expenses at our coal fired power plants due to the timing of maintenance outages, and an increase in legal fees for environmental issues and general litigation. The effect on other operations and maintenance expenses from transactions related to noncore properties, including the impairment of a Delta Air Lines, Inc. lease in 2005, was comparable between years. Reducing the unfavorable impact of the above items were lower labor costs and a decrease in bad debt expense of $17 million in 2006. An anticipated increase in uncollectible accounts due to higher natural gas prices was mitigated by mild winter weather. In 2005, a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage resulted in other operations and maintenance expenses of $31 million; there was no refueling and maintenance outage in 2006. Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 are discussed below. Missouri Regulated UE Other operations and maintenance expenses increased in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of storm repair 41 Table of Contents expenditures of $38 million, incremental costs associated with the Taum Sauk plant incident of $25 million, as noted above, and higher maintenance expenses at UEs coal fired power plants. Reducing the impact of these unfavorable items were decreased injury and damage expenses, decreased bad debt expenses, lower labor and employee benefit costs, and the lack of a scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage in 2006, which resulted in other operations and maintenance expenses of $31 million in 2005. Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $7 million in 2006 as a result of the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS in May 2005. Illinois Regulated Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $45 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in the Illinois Regulated segment, as detailed below. CIPS Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $13 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of storm repair expenditures of $6 million and the transfer of UEs Illinois service territory to CIPS in May 2005, which resulted in additional other operations and maintenance expenses of $7 million. Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses increased because of contributions of $4 million associated with the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan in 2006. The negative impact of these items was reduced by lower bad debt expense. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $4 million in 2006 from 2005, primarily because of lower employee benefit costs and reduced bad debt expenses. Reducing the benefit of these items were $3 million of contributions associated with the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan and $5 million of storm repair and tree trimming expenditures in 2006. IP Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $46 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of storm repair expenditures of $24 million and contributions associated with the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan of $8 million in 2006, along with higher rental expenses, and higher injury and damage expenses. The negative effect of these items was reduced by lower labor costs and employee benefit costs. Non rate regulated Generation Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $28 million in 2006 compared with 2005 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment, as detailed below. Genco Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $13 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of higher maintenance expenses resulting from more scheduled power plant maintenance outages in 2006. CILCO (AERG) Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between 2006 and 2005, as decreased maintenance costs were offset by increased legal and environmental expenses. CILCORP (Parent Company only) EEI Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $8 million at CILCORP (Parent Company only) and $3 million at EEI in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of increased employee benefit costs. Depreciation and Amortization 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased $20 million in 2007 over 2006. The increases were primarily because of amortization of a regulatory asset in 2007 at IP, as discussed below, and capital additions in 2006 and 2007. A decrease in depreciation expenses as a result of a MoPSC electric rate order somewhat mitigated that effect. The MoPSC order extended the lives of UEs Callaway nuclear plant and coal fired generation plant for purposes of calculating depreciation expense, beginning in June 2007. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2007 were comparable with 2006. Increased expenses associated with capital additions in 2006 and 2007 were offset by a reduction in depreciation as a result of the MoPSC electric rate order noted above. Illinois Regulated Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $25 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2007 compared with 2006. CIPS CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006. 42 Table of Contents IP Depreciation and amortization expenses, including amortization of regulatory assets on IPs statement of income, increased $19 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of the start of amortization in 2007 of a regulatory asset associated with acquisition integration costs, as required by an ICC order, and capital additions. Non rate regulated Generation Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment and for Genco, CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI. 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased $29 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of capital additions. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $25 million in 2006 over 2005. The increases were primarily because of capital additions, which included new steam generators and turbine rotors installed during the refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant in 2005, as well as CTs purchased in the first quarter of 2006. Additionally, depreciation increased because CTs were transferred to UE from Genco in May 2005. Reducing depreciation expense was the property transfer to CIPS as part of the Illinois service territory transfer in May 2005. Illinois Regulated Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in the Illinois Regulated segment, CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and IP in 2006 and 2005. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $3 million at CIPS primarily because of property transferred from UE to CIPS as part of the Illinois service territory transfer in May 2005. Non rate regulated Generation Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in 2006 and 2005 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment and for CILCORP (Parent Company only), Genco, CILCO (AERG), and EEI. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Amerens taxes other than income taxes decreased $10 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of lower gross receipts and property taxes. Variations in taxes other than income taxes for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Taxes other than income taxes increased $4 million in 2007 over 2006, primarily because of increased gross receipts taxes. Illinois Regulated Taxes other than income taxes decreased $16 million in 2007 compared with 2006 in the Illinois Regulated segment. Taxes other than income taxes decreased $7 million at CIPS, $2 million at CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and $7 million at IP in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily as a result of reduced property taxes and excise taxes. Non rate regulated Generation Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between 2007 and 2006 for the Non rate regulated Generation segment and for Genco, CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG), and EEI. 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Amerens taxes other than income taxes increased $26 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily as a result of higher gross receipts, and higher excise taxes and property taxes. Variations in taxes other than income taxes for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Taxes other than income taxes were comparable in 2006 and 2005. Illinois Regulated In the Illinois Regulated segment, taxes other than income taxes increased $18 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Taxes other than income taxes increased $8 million at CIPS, $5 million at CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and $5 million at IP in 2006 over 2005, primarily as a result of higher property taxes and excise taxes. 43 Table of Contents Non rate regulated Generation In the Non rate regulated Generation segment, taxes other than income taxes increased $7 million in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily because of higher property taxes at Genco. A court decision in the first quarter of 2005 favorably affected taxes that year. Taxes other than income taxes were comparable in 2006 and 2005 at CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG), and EEI. Other Income and Expenses 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Miscellaneous income increased $27 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of increased interest and investment income. Cash balances were higher because of uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of legislative and regulatory issues in Illinois. Miscellaneous expense increased $6 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because we made contributions to our charitable trust and because Illinois Regulated made contributions of $5 million for energy efficiency and customer assistance programs as part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Variations in other income and expenses for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Other income and expenses were comparable in 2007 with 2006. Illinois Regulated Other income and expenses increased $6 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of increased interest income at IP. Other income and expenses were comparable between periods at CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated). Non rate regulated Generation Other income and expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006 for the Non rate regulated Generation segment and for Genco, CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG), and EEI. 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Miscellaneous income increased $21 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of $24 million of interest income on a taxable industrial development revenue bond acquired by UE in conjunction with its purchase of a CT in the first quarter of 2006. This amount was offset by an equivalent amount of interest expense on Amerens and UEs statements of income. Miscellaneous expense decreased $8 million, primarily because of decreased donations in 2006 and the write off of unrecoverable natural gas costs in 2005. Variations in other income and expenses for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Miscellaneous income increased $16 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily as a result of interest income on a taxable industrial development revenue bond acquired by UE in conjunction with its purchase of a CT as noted above. This favorable impact was partially offset by lower capitalization of equity funds used during construction in 2006. In 2005, UE replaced steam generators and turbine rotors at the Callaway nuclear plant. Miscellaneous expense was comparable in 2006 and 2005. Illinois Regulated Other income and expenses were comparable for Illinois Regulated, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and IP in 2006 and 2005. Non rate regulated Generation Other income and expenses were comparable for Non rate regulated Generation, Genco, CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG), and EEI in 2006 and 2005. Interest 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Interest expense increased $73 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of increased short term borrowings, higher interest rates due to reduced credit ratings, and other items noted below. With the adoption of FIN 48 in 2007, we also began to record interest associated with uncertain tax positions as interest expense in 2007 rather than income tax expense. These interest charges were $10 million for 2007. Reducing the effect of the above unfavorable items were maturities of $350 million of long term debt in the first half of 2007 at Ameren and redemptions/maturities at the Ameren Companies as noted below. Variations in interest expense for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Interest expense increased $23 million in 2007 over 2006, primarily because of increased short term borrowings, higher interest rates due to reduced credit ratings, and the issuance of $425 million of senior secured notes in June 44 Table of Contents 2007. Interest expense recorded in conjunction with uncertain tax positions was $3 million in 2007. Illinois Regulated Interest expense increased $37 million in the Illinois Regulated segment and increased at CIPS and IP in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of increased short term borrowings and higher interest rates due to reduced credit ratings and the issuance of senior secured notes in 2007 and 2006. IP issued $250 million and $75 million of senior secured notes in November 2007 and June 2006, respectively. CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated) issued $61 million and $96 million of senior secured notes, respectively, in June 2006. Reducing the effect of the above items was the maturity of $50 million of first mortgage bonds at CILCO (Illinois Regulated) in January 2007 and payments made on IPs note payable to IP SPT in 2007 and 2006. Non rate regulated Generation Interest expense increased $4 million in the Non rate regulated Generation segment in 2007 compared with 2006. CILCORP (Parent Company only) CILCO (AERG) Interest expense increased $3 million at CILCORP (Parent Company only) and $5 million at CILCO (AERG) in 2007 over 2006, primarily because of increased short term borrowings and higher interest rates due to reduced credit ratings. Genco Interest expense decreased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of reduced intercompany borrowings. Partially reducing this benefit was increased interest expense of $3 million recorded in conjunction with uncertain tax positions in 2007. EEI Interest expense was comparable in 2007 and 2006. 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Amerens interest expense increased $49 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of items noted below for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for each of the Ameren Companies individually. Missouri Regulated UE Interest expense increased $55 million in 2006 over 2005. UE issued $300 million of senior secured notes in July 2005 and $260 million of senior secured notes in December 2005. It also increased its short term borrowings, partly in connection with the purchase of CTs in the first quarter of 2006. Interest expense of $24 million was recognized on UEs capital lease associated with one of these CTs. This amount was offset by an equivalent amount of interest income on industrial revenue bonds in Amerens and UEs statements of income. Illinois Regulated In the Illinois Regulated segment, interest expense increased $9 million in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily because of the issuance of $75 million of senior secured notes in June 2006 and increased money pool borrowings at IP. Interest expense at CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated) was comparable in 2006 and 2005. Non rate regulated Generation In the Non rate regulated Generation segment, interest expense decreased $16 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Interest expense decreased $13 million at Genco resulting from the maturity of $225 million of its senior notes in 2005. Interest expense at CILCORP (Parent Company only), CILCO (AERG), and EEI was comparable in 2006 and 2005. Income Taxes 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Amerens effective tax rate increased between 2007 and 2006. Variations in effective tax rates for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE The effective tax rate decreased in 2007 from 2006, primarily because of the implementation of changes ordered by the MoPSC in UEs 2007 electric rate order, which reduced the net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to 2006, decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2007 compared to increases in 2006, and increased production activity deductions in 2007 compared to 2006. Illinois Regulated The effective tax rate decreased in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2007 compared with 2006, because of the items detailed below. CIPS The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of higher reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2007 compared to 2006, unfavorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2006, lower permanent benefit for SFAS No. 106 2, as it relates to Medicare Part D provisions, and other 45 Table of Contents miscellaneous items, offset by the increased impact of the amortization of investment tax credit, and other items on lower pretax book income. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of an increase in the permanent benefit for SFAS No. 106 2, as it relates to Medicare Part D provisions, along with favorable net amortization of the property related regulatory assets and liabilities, and increased impact of the amortization of investment tax credit on lower pretax book income. IP The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to unfavorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2006. Non rate regulated Generation The effective tax rate increased in the Non rate regulated Generation segment in 2007 compared with 2006, because of items detailed below. Genco The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of lower decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2007 compared to 2006, and decreased production activity deductions in 2007 compared to 2006. CILCO (AERG) The effective tax rate increased in 2007, primarily because of higher reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2007 compared to 2006 and decreased impact of amortization of investment tax credit on higher pretax book income, offset by increased production activity deductions in 2007 compared to 2006, and differences between the book and tax treatment of the sales of noncore properties in 2006. CILCORP (Parent Company only) The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of a change in the permanent benefit for SFAS No. 106 2, as it relates to Medicare Part D provisions. EEI The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of increased production activity deductions. 2006 versus 2005 Ameren Amerens effective tax rate decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily because of differences between the book and tax treatment of the sales of noncore properties, as well as the items discussed below. Variations in effective tax rates for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2006 and 2005 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE The effective tax rate increased in 2006 over the prior year, primarily because of an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2006 compared to a decrease in 2005, and lower unfavorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2006 compared to 2005. Illinois Regulated The effective tax rate decreased in 2006 from 2005 at Illinois Regulated, primarily because of the items detailed below. CIPS The effective tax rate decreased from the prior year, primarily because of favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities and larger decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2006 compared to 2005, offset by lower permanent benefits for SFAS No. 106 2, as it relates to Medicare Part D provisions. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) The effective tax rate increased in 2006 over 2005, primarily because of lower permanent benefits related to company owned life insurance and SFAS No. 106 2, as it relates to Medicare Part D provisions. IP The effective tax rate was comparable in 2006 and 2005. Non rate regulated Generation The effective tax rate decreased in 2006 compared with 2005 at Non rate regulated Generation, primarily because of the items detailed below. Genco The effective tax rate decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily because of the resolution of uncertain tax positions in 2006 based on favorable developments with taxing authorities, and increased production activity deductions. CILCO (AERG) The effective tax rate decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily because of the resolution of uncertain tax positions in 2006 based on favorable developments with taxing authorities compared to an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2005, as well as the difference between the book and tax treatment of the sales of noncore properties in 2006. 46 Table of Contents CILCORP (Parent Company only) The effective tax rate decreased from the prior year, primarily because of a change in the permanent benefit of SFAS No. 106 2, as it relates to Medicare Part D provisions. EEI The effective tax rate was comparable in 2006 and 2005. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The tariff based gross margins of Amerens rate regulated utility operating companies (UE, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP) continue to be the principal source of cash from operating activities for Ameren and its rate regulated subsidiaries. A diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate regulated residential, commercial and industrial classes and a commodity mix of gas and electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows for Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP. For operating cash flows, Genco and AERG rely principally on power sales to Marketing Company, which sold power to CIPS, CILCO and IP via the September 2006 Illinois power procurement auction and via financial contracts that were part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Marketing Company is also selling power through other primarily market based contracts with wholesale and retail customers. In addition to cash flows from operating activities, the Ameren Companies use available cash, credit facilities, money pool or other short term borrowings from affiliates or commercial paper to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements. The use of operating cash flows and short term borrowings to fund capital expenditures and other investments may periodically result in a working capital deficit, as was the case at December 31, 2007, for Ameren, Genco, CILCORP, and CILCO. The Ameren Companies may reduce their short term borrowings with cash from operations or discretionarily with long term borrowings, or in the case of Ameren subsidiaries, with equity infusions from Ameren. The Ameren Companies will incur significant capital expenditures over the next five years as they comply with environmental regulations and make significant investments in their electric and gas utility infrastructure to improve overall system reliability. Expenditures not funded with operating cash flows are expected to be funded primarily with debt. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, which among other things, will change the process for power procurement in Illinois and affect future cash flows of the Ameren Companies, except UE. The settlement resulted in customer refunds and credits during 2007, and it will result in further credits to customers through 2010. The Ameren Illinois Utilities will receive reimbursement for most of these refunds and credits from Illinois power generators, including Genco and AERG. The following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Net Cash Provided By Net Cash Provided By Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities (Used In) Investing Activities (Used In) Financing Activities 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Ameren(a) $ 1,102 $ 1,279 $ 1,251 $ (1,468 ) $ (1,266 ) $ (961 ) $ 584 $ 28 $ (263 ) UE 588 734 706 (700 ) (732 ) (800 ) 296 (21 ) 66 CIPS 14 118 133 (42 ) (66 ) (12 ) 48 (46 ) (123 ) Genco 255 138 213 (210 ) (110 ) 95 (44 ) (27 ) (309 ) CILCORP 33 133 33 (214 ) (90 ) (109 ) 183 (42 ) 72 CILCO 74 153 67 (212 ) (161 ) (114 ) 141 9 47 IP 28 172 148 (180 ) (180 ) 9 158 8 (162 ) (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. Cash Flows from Operating Activities 2007 versus 2006 Amerens cash from operating activities decreased in 2007, as compared with 2006. This was primarily because of an increase in working capital investment as the collection of higher electric rates from Illinois electric customers lagged payments for power purchases, and past due accounts increased because of the higher rates. The Illinois electric settlement agreement resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of $88 million: $211 million of customer refunds, credits, and program funding, minus related reimbursements from nonaffiliated Illinois generators of $123 million. As of the end of 2007, $34 million was due from nonaffiliated generators. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a complete discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Other factors also reduced cash flow: increased interest payments as a result of lower credit ratings and increased debt. In addition, cash spent for fuel inventory increased because UE increased its inventory, and AERG experienced increased inventory as a result of an extended plant outage. Also reducing operating cash flows was a $25 million increase in pension and postretirement benefit contributions. In 2007, a $120 million decrease in income taxes paid (net of refunds) benefited cash flows from operations in 2007. Increases in electric and gas margins of $296 million and $15 million, respectively, also benefited operating cash flows, but were reduced by higher operations and maintenance expenses, as discussed in Results of Operations. 47 Table of Contents At UE, cash from operating activities decreased in 2007, compared with 2006, primarily because of an increase in accounts receivable caused by higher prices for interchange power sales, colder weather in December 2007 than in December 2006, and increased electric rates. Further reducing cash flows in 2007 was an increase in interest payments and other operations and maintenance expenditures, including $35 million for the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage. In addition, UE increased its fuel inventory. Compared with 2006, cash flows from operations in 2007 benefited from an increase in margin, as discussed in Results of Operations, a decrease in cash paid for Taum Sauk incident related costs (net of insurance recoveries) of $60 million, and a decrease in income tax payments (net of refunds) of $86 million. At CIPS, cash from operating activities decreased in 2007, compared with 2006. The Illinois electric settlement agreement resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of $31 million, including $74 million of customer refunds, credits, and program funding, and related reimbursements from nonaffiliated Illinois generators of $43 million. As of the end of 2007, $13 million was due from nonaffiliated generators. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a complete discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Cash from operations was further reduced by a decrease in electric margins and higher expenses, as discussed in Results of Operations. In addition, there was an increase in working capital investment, as the collection of higher electric rates from customers lagged payments for power purchases, and past due customer accounts increased because of higher rates. Income tax payments (net of refunds) decreased $44 million, benefiting cash flows from operations. Gencos cash from operating activities increased in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because electric margins were up, as discussed in Results of Operations, and because cash spent for fuel inventory was down. In 2006, large cash outlays were made to replenish coal inventory after delivery disruptions caused by train derailments. Reducing these increases in cash from operating activities was an increase in income tax payments (net of refunds) of $27 million. Cash from operating activities decreased for CILCORP and CILCO in 2007, compared with 2006. The Illinois electric settlement agreement resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of $17 million: $41 million of customer refunds, credits, and program funding, minus related reimbursements from nonaffiliated Illinois generators of $24 million. As of the end of 2007, $7 million was due from nonaffiliated generators. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a complete discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Working capital investment increased because the collection of higher electric rates from customers lagged payments for power purchases, past due customer accounts increased due to higher rates, and inventory levels increased at AERG due to an extended plant outage. In addition, income tax payments (net of refunds) increased $16 million for CILCORP and $15 million for CILCO. Increased electric and gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, benefited cash flows from operating activities. IPs cash from operating activities decreased in 2007, compared with 2006. The Illinois electric settlement agreement resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of $40 million: $96 million of customer refunds, credits, and program funding, minus related reimbursements from nonaffiliated Illinois generators of $56 million. As of the end of 2007, $14 million was due from nonaffiliated generators. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a complete discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Further reducing cash from operating activities compared to the prior year was a reduction in electric margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, and a $13 million increase in pension and postretirement benefit contributions. Working capital investment increased because the collection of higher electric rates from customers lagged payments for power purchases, and past due customer accounts increased because of higher rates. Income tax payments (net of refunds) increased by $15 million, further reducing cash flows from operations. 2006 versus 2005 Amerens cash from operations increased in 2006, compared with 2005. As discussed in Results of Operations, electric margins increased by $41 million, while gas margins decreased by $24 million. Benefiting operating cash flows in 2006 was an $84 million decrease in pension and postretirement benefit contributions. IP also collected higher than normal trade receivables in 2006 because of the especially cold December 2005 weather during the winter heating season. The cash impact from trade receivables was more significant in 2006 because we had higher gas prices and colder December 2005 weather. Negative impacts on operating cash flow include a $216 million increase in income tax payments, expenditures of $59 million (including a $10 million FERC fine) associated with the breach of the upper reservoir at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility in December 2005, and $37 million of other operations and maintenance expenses due to severe storms. Most of the Taum Sauk expenditures were pending recovery from insurance carriers at the end of 2006. In addition, there was an increase in cash used during 2006 for payment of 2005 costs, including $9 million for other operations and maintenance and $14 million for annual incentive compensation. These expenses were higher in 2006 than they were in 2005, because of increased 2005 earnings relative to performance targets. The cash benefit from reduced natural gas inventories as a result of lower prices was offset by increased volume of coal inventory purchases, because of the coal supply delivery issues experienced in 2005. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies Pumped storage Hydroelectric Facility Breach to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for more information regarding the Taum Sauk incident. 48 Table of Contents At UE, cash from operating activities increased in 2006. Overall margins were higher in 2006 than in 2005. Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable with the previous years, despite $59 million (including $10 million for a FERC fine) spent due to the breach of the upper reservoir at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility as discussed above for Ameren, and $24 million spent due to severe storms. Pension and postretirement benefit contributions were $61 million less than in the prior year. Income tax payments increased $51 million, and interest payments increased $40 million because of increased outstanding debt. Cash used for coal purchases increased in 2006 to alleviate the coal supply delivery issues experienced in 2005. Cash used for working capital increased, largely because of storm related costs. At CIPS, cash from operating activities decreased from the prior year. The negative cash effect of higher other operations and maintenance expenses was reduced by a small increase in electric and gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations. Income tax payments increased $55 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Reducing this use of cash was a decrease in pension and postretirement benefit contributions of $11 million in 2006 compared with 2005, and an increase in collections of trade receivables as a result of colder December 2005 weather and higher gas prices than in the year ago period. Gencos cash from operating activities in 2006 decreased compared with the 2005 period, primarily because of lower operating margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, and increases in coal inventory. Income tax payments decreased by $17 million in 2006, pension and postretirement benefit payments decreased $9 million, and interest payments were lower because there was less debt outstanding. Cash from operating activities increased for CILCORP and CILCO in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily because of higher electric margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, and an increase in collections of trade receivables as a result of colder December 2005 weather and higher gas prices than in 2004. In addition, income tax payments decreased $25 million for CILCORP and $17 million for CILCO. An increase in coal deliveries at CILCOs subsidiary, AERG, negatively affected cash. IPs cash from operations increased in 2006, compared with 2005. Benefiting 2006 cash flows were the collection of higher than normal trade receivables caused by cold December 2005 weather, as discussed above for Ameren, and a $1 million decrease in pension and postretirement benefit payments. These increases were reduced by lower electric margins and higher other operations and maintenance expenses, including $9 million related to severe storms, net income tax refunds of $13 million in 2006 compared with $22 million in 2005, and cash used in 2006 for payment of 2005 costs, as discussed above for Ameren, including an increase of $7 million in other operations and maintenance expenses, and an increase of $3 million in incentive compensation. Pension Funding Amerens pension plans are funded in compliance with income tax regulations and federal funding requirements. In May 2007, the MoPSC issued an electric rate order that allows UE to recover through customer rates the pension expense it incurred under GAAP. Consequently, Ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the total pension expense. Based on Amerens assumptions at December 31, 2007, and reflecting this pension funding policy, Ameren expects to make annual voluntary contributions of $40 million to $65 million in each of the next five years. We expect UEs, CIPS, Gencos, CILCOs, and IPs portion of the future funding requirements to be 65%, 8%, 11%, 5% and 11%, respectively. These amounts are estimates; the numbers may change with actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions. See Note 9 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2007 versus 2006 Ameren used more cash for investing activities in 2007 than in 2006. Net cash used for capital expenditures increased in 2007 as a result of power plant scrubber installation projects, other upgrades at various power plants, and reliability improvements of the transmission and distribution systems, but this increase was reduced by the absence in 2007 of CT acquisitions that occurred in 2006. The $43 million decrease in 2007 of proceeds from sales of noncore properties also increased net cash used in investing activities. An $18 million decrease in emission allowance purchases benefited cash flows from investing activities, while cash received in 2007 for emission allowance sales was $66 million less than in the prior year, because remaining allowances are expected to be retained for environmental compliance needs. UEs cash used in investing activities decreased in 2007, compared with 2006, principally because of the $292 million expended for CT purchases in 2006 that was not spent in 2007. Otherwise, capital expenditures increased $135 million because of storm repair costs, a power plant scrubber installation project, and other upgrades at various power plants. Other impacts on cash used in investing activities were the absence of sales of noncore properties in 2007 compared with a $13 million sale in 2006, and the 2006 receipt of $67 million in proceeds from an intercompany note related to the transfer of UEs Illinois territory to CIPS. Additionally, nuclear fuel expenditures increased $29 million in 2007 over 2006 because of a refueling outage, and sales of emission allowances decreased $35 million because remaining allowances are being retained for environmental compliance needs. CIPS cash used in investing activities decreased in 2007, compared with 2006. CIPS investing cash flow was positively affected by a $3 million increase in proceeds from 49 Table of Contents CIPS note receivable from Genco in 2007 compared with 2006 and the lack of a 2006 $17 million expenditure to repurchase its own outstanding bond. Capital expenditures were $3 million lower in 2007 than in 2006. Genco had an increase in net cash used in investing activities for 2007, compared with 2006. This increase was due primarily to a $106 million increase in capital expenditures related to a scrubber project at one of its power plants and various other plant upgrades. Emission allowance purchases decreased by $6 million. CILCORPs and CILCOs cash used in investing activities increased in 2007, compared with 2006. Cash flow used in investing activities increased as a result of a $135 million increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to a power plant scrubber project and other plant upgrades at AERG. The absence in 2007 of $11 million of proceeds received in 2006 from the sale of leveraged leases, and (for CILCORP only) the absence in 2007 of a 2006 note receivable payment from Resources Company in the amount of $71 million related to the 2005 transfer of leveraged leases from CILCORP to Resources Company, contributed to the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007. The net year over year reduction of $84 million and $82 million in money pool advances for CILCO and CILCORP, respectively, and a $12 million reduction of emission allowance purchases benefited cash flows from investing activities in 2007. IPs net use of cash in investing activities for 2007 was comparable with 2006. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of future environmental capital investment estimates. 2006 versus 2005 Amerens increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to UEs 2006 purchases of a 640 megawatt CT facility from affiliates of NRG Energy Inc. and 510 megawatt and 340 megawatt CT facilities from subsidiaries of Aquila Inc., for a total of $292 million; increased nuclear fuel expenditures of $22 million; and $96 million of capital expenditures during 2006 related to the severe storms. The CT purchases were intended to meet UEs increased generating capacity needs and to provide UE with additional flexibility in determining the timing of future baseload generating capacity additions. Emission allowance purchases decreased $50 million in 2006 compared with 2005, while emission allowance sales increased $49 million. The sale of noncore properties in 2006 provided a $56 million benefit to Amerens cash from investing activities. UEs cash used in investing activities decreased in 2006, compared with 2005, principally because of a decrease in capital expenditures at the Callaway nuclear plant. This is due to UE spending $221 million for planned upgrades during a scheduled refueling outage in 2005. In addition, in 2006 UE received $67 million from CIPS as repayment of an intercompany note. The cash effect of the $292 million in CT purchases discussed above was more than the prior year effect of the $237 million purchase of two CTs from Genco and the purchase of CT equipment from Development Company for $25 million. UEs capital expenditures related to the 2006 severe storms were $47 million. In 2006, UE had a $13 million gain on the sale of a noncore property, and a $35 million increase in sales of emission allowances. CIPS cash used in investing activities increased in 2006, compared with 2005. Capital expenditures increased $18 million. Also negatively affecting CIPS investing cash flow was an $18 million reduction in proceeds from CIPS note receivable from Genco in 2006. In addition, CIPS paid $17 million to repurchase its own outstanding bond. The bond remains outstanding, and CIPS is currently the holder and debtor. The increased capital expenditures resulted partly from CIPS expansion of its service territory because of its acquisition of UEs Illinois utility operations in May 2005. In addition, $16 million was expended as a result of storms. CIPS remaining capital expenditures were for projects to improve the reliability of its electric and gas transmission and distribution systems. Genco had a net use of cash in investing activities for 2006, compared with a net source of cash for 2005. This was due primarily to the 2005 sale of two CTs to UE for $241 million. Purchases of emission allowances were $45 million less in 2006 than in 2005. Capital expenditures increased $9 million for 2006 compared with 2005. CILCORPs cash used in investing activities decreased, and CILCOs increased in 2006, compared with 2005. Capital expenditures increased $12 million for CILCORP and CILCO, and net money pool advances decreased for each company by $42 million. CILCORPs cash from investing activities further benefited from the repayment of Resources Companys note for $71 million, which originated from the 2005 transfer of leveraged leases from CILCORP to Resources Company. In addition, a subsidiary of CILCORP and CILCO generated cash from investing activities of $11 million in 2006, from the sale of its remaining leveraged lease investments. Emission allowance purchases were $9 million less in 2006 than in 2005. IP had a net use of cash in investing activities for 2006, compared with a net source of cash for 2005, primarily because of the absence in 2006 of the 2005 repayments for advances made to the money pool in prior periods. In addition, capital expenditures increased $47 million over the year ago period, which included $27 million as a result of severe storms, and increased expenditures to maintain the reliability of IPs electric and gas transmission and distribution systems. Intercompany Transfer of Illinois Service Territory On May 2, 2005, UE completed the transfer of its Illinois based electric and natural gas service territory to CIPS, at a net book value of $133 million. UE transferred 50% of the assets directly to CIPS in consideration for a CIPS subordinated promissory note in the principal amount 50 Table of Contents of $67 million and 50% of the assets by means of a dividend in kind to Ameren, followed by a capital contribution by Ameren to CIPS. The remaining principal balance of $61 million under the note was repaid in full by CIPS in June 2006. Capital Expenditures The following table presents the capital expenditures by the Ameren Companies for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005: Capital Expenditures 2007 2006 2005 Ameren(a) $ 1,381 $ 1,284 $ 935 (b) UE 625 782 775 CIPS 79 82 64 Genco 191 85 76 CILCORP 254 119 107 CILCO (Illinois Regulated) 64 53 55 CILCO (AERG) 190 66 52 IP 178 179 132 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries. (b) Includes intercompany eliminations. Amerens 2007 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE spent $101 million toward a scrubber at one of its power plants, and incurred storm damage expenditures of $56 million. IP incurred storm damage related expenditures of $24 million. At Genco and AERG there were cash outlays of $102 million and $76 million, respectively, for scrubber projects. The scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental regulations. AERG also made expenditures for a boiler upgrade of $45 million. Other capital expenditures were principally to maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP as well as various plant upgrades. Amerens 2006 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE purchased three CTs totaling $292 million. In addition, UE spent $40 million toward a scrubber at one of its power plants, and incurred storm damage expenditures of $47 million. CIPS and IP incurred storm damage related expenditures of $16 million and $27 million, respectively. At Genco and AERG there was a cash outlay of $24 million and $11 million, respectively, for scrubber projects. Genco also made expenditures for a boiler upgrade of $16 million. Other capital expenditures were principally to maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP. Amerens 2005 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UEs capital expenditures for 2005 principally consisted of $221 million for steam generators, low pressure rotor replacements, and other upgrades during the 2005 refueling and maintenance outage at its Callaway nuclear plant. UE also incurred expenditures of $65 million for three CTs at its Venice plant, $60 million for numerous projects at its generating plants, and $45 million for various upgrades to its transmission and distribution system. In addition, UE incurred expenditures of $237 million for CTs purchased from Genco, as discussed above. CILCORPs and CILCOs capital expenditures included $29 million for ongoing generation plant projects to improve flexibility in future fuel supply for power generation. In addition, CILCO, CIPS, and IP incurred expenditures to maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of their electric and gas transmission and distribution systems. The following table estimates the capital expenditures that will be incurred by the Ameren Companies from 2008 through 2012, including construction expenditures, capitalized interest and allowance for funds used during construction (except for Genco, which has no allowance for funds used during construction), and estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental standards: 2008 2009 2012 Total UE $ 1,030 $ 2,920 $ 3,880 $ 3,950 $ 4,910 CIPS 105 300 400 405 505 Genco 405 1,300 1,670 1,705 2,075 CILCO (Illinois Regulated) 95 250 330 345 425 CILCO (AERG) 265 460 605 725 870 IP 200 675 890 875 1,090 EEI 65 365 490 430 555 Other 70 130 135 200 205 Ameren(a) $ 2,235 $ 6,400 $ 8,400 $ 8,635 $ 10,635 (a) Includes amounts for nonregistrant Ameren subsidiaries. UEs estimated capital expenditures include transmission, distribution and generation related activities, as well as expenditures for compliance with new environmental regulations discussed below. CIPS, CILCOs, and IPs estimated capital expenditures are primarily for electric and gas transmission and distribution related activities. Gencos estimated capital expenditures are primarily for compliance with environmental regulations and upgrades to existing coal and gas fired generating facilities. CILCO (AERG)s estimate includes capital expenditures primarily for compliance with environmental regulations at AERGs generating facilities, as well as generation related activities. We continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs. As a result, we could modify our plan for generation capacity, which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and whether capacity or power may be purchased, among other things. Any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material. Environmental Capital Expenditures Ameren, UE, Genco, AERG and EEI will incur significant costs in future years to comply with EPA and state regulations regarding SO2 and NOx emissions (the Clean Air 51 Table of Contents Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions (the Clean Air Mercury Rule) from coal fired power plants. In May 2005, the EPA issued final regulations with respect to SO2 and NOx emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions (the Clean Air Mercury Rule) from coal fired power plants. The rules require significant reductions in these emissions from UE, Genco, AERG and EEI power plants in phases, beginning in 2009. States have finalized rules to implement the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule. Illinois has finalized rules to implement the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule program that will reduce the number of NOx allowances automatically allocated to Gencos, AERGs and EEIs plants. As a result of the Illinois rules, Genco, AERG and EEI will need to procure allowances and install pollution control equipment. Current plans include the installation of scrubbers for SO2 reduction and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems for NOx reduction at certain coal fired plants in Illinois. Missouri rules, which substantially follow the federal regulations, became effective in April 2007. As a result of the Missouri rules, UE will manage allowances and install pollution control equipment. Current plans include the installation of scrubbers for SO2 reduction and co benefit reduction of mercury and pollution control equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions at certain coal fired plants in Missouri. Illinois has adopted rules for mercury emissions that are significantly stricter than the federal regulations. In 2006, Genco, CILCO, EEI, and the Illinois EPA entered into an agreement that was incorporated into Illinois mercury emission regulations. Under the regulations, Illinois generators may defer until 2015 the requirement to reduce mercury emissions by 90% in exchange for accelerated installation of NOx and SO2 controls. In 2009, Genco, AERG and EEI will begin putting into service equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions. In February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a decision that effectively vacated the federal Clean Air Mercury rule. The court ruled that the EPA erred in the method used to remove electric generating units from the list of sources subject to the maximum available control technology requirements under the Clean Air Act. The Courts decision is subject to appeal and it is uncertain how the EPA will respond. At this time, we are unable to determine the impact that this action would have on our estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental rules, our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. The table below presents estimated capital costs based on current technology to comply with both the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule through 2017 and related state implementation plans. The estimates described below could change, depending upon additional federal or state requirements, new technology, variations in costs of material or labor, or alternative compliance strategies, among other reasons. The timing of estimated capital costs may also be influenced by whether emission allowances are used to comply with the proposed rules, thereby deferring capital investment. 2008 2009 2012 2013 2017 Total UE(a) $ 255 $ 215 $ 295 $ 1,300 $ 1,700 $ 1,770 $ 2,250 Genco 300 955 1,210 45 70 1,300 1,580 AERG 170 380 500 70 90 620 760 EEI 30 260 350 20 30 310 410 Ameren $ 755 $ 1,810 $ 2,355 $ 1,435 $ 1,890 $ 4,000 $ 5,000 (a) UEs expenditures are expected to be recoverable in rates over time. Illinois and Missouri must also develop attainment plans to meet the federal eight hour ozone ambient standard, the federal fine particulate ambient standard, and the Clean Air Visibility rule. Both states have filed ozone attainment plans for the St. Louis area. The state attainment plans for fine particulate matter must be submitted to the EPA by April 2008. The plans for the Clean Air Visibility rule were submitted in December 2007. The costs in the table above assume that emission controls required for the Clean Air Interstate Rule regulations will be sufficient to meet these new standards in the St. Louis region. Should Missouri develop an alternative plan to comply with these standards, the cost impact could be material to UE, but we expect these costs to be recoverable from ratepayers. Illinois is planning to impose additional requirements beyond the Clean Air Interstate Rule as part of the attainment plans for ozone and fine particulate matter. At this time, we are unable to determine the impact that state actions would have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. The impact that future initiatives related to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming may have on us is unknown and therefore not included in the estimated environmental expenditures. Although compliance costs are unlikely in the near future, our costs of complying with any mandated federal or state greenhouse gas program could have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of environmental matters. Cash Flows from Financing Activities 2007 versus 2006 Ameren had an increase of $556 million in its net cash from financing activities in 2007, compared to 2006. Positive effects on cash included a net increase of $441 million in net short term debt proceeds in 2007 over 2006, and a 52 Table of Contents $442 million increase in the issuance of long term debt. These increased proceeds were used to fund a $324 million increase in redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long term debt and to fund the working capital needs of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. UE had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2007, compared with a net use of cash in 2006. The primary reasons for the change include a $380 million capital contribution from Ameren and the issuance of $424 million of long term debt in 2007. The proceeds were used to repay short term debt and to fund working capital and capital expenditures. Other net uses of cash in 2007 included the repayment of a note Ameren issued in 2006 and an $18 million increase in dividend payments. CIPS had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2007, compared with a net use of cash in 2006. This was primarily the result of an increase of $55 million in net short term debt proceeds in 2007 over 2006, and a $10 million decrease in dividend payments. Cash was also positively affected in 2007 by a $20 million decrease in redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long term debt and the absence in 2007 of the 2006 payments of $67 million on an intercompany note with UE. Cash flows in 2006 benefited from $61 million in proceeds from long term debt issuances that did not recur in 2007. Genco had a net increase in cash used in financing activities for 2007 over 2006, principally because of a $125 million decrease in capital contributions received from Ameren. Cash benefited in 2007 by a $100 million increase in net proceeds from short term debt. CILCORP had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2007, compared with a net use of cash in 2006. CILCOs cash provided by financing activities increased in 2007, compared with 2006. Net money pool repayments decreased $154 million at CILCORP and $161 million at CILCO. A net increase in short term debt of $90 million at CILCORP and $15 million at CILCO in 2007 resulted in a positive effect on cash. In 2007, CILCORP and CILCO did not issue any dividends on common stock; in 2006 CILCORP issued $50 million and CILCO $65 million. As a result, cash flows from financing activities benefited in 2007 as compared to 2006. Additionally, in 2006 a note payable to Ameren was repaid, which resulted in a net use of cash of $113 million at CILCORP. Note payable repayments were only $71 million in 2007. These positive effects on cash were reduced by the lack of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in 2007 compared with $96 million at both CILCORP and CILCO in 2006. IP had an increase in its net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 compared with 2006. This was primarily the result of an increase in proceeds from short term debt and a $175 million increase from the issuance of long term debt. The proceeds from the 2007 long term debt issuance were used to repay borrowings under the Ameren utility money pool and under the 2007 credit facility. Other net uses of cash included $61 million of common stock dividends in 2007. 2006 versus 2005 Ameren had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2006, compared with a net use of cash in 2005. Positive effects on cash included a net increase of $419 million in net short term debt proceeds in 2006, compared with net repayments of $224 million of short term debt in 2005, and a $454 million decrease in long term debt redemptions, repurchases and maturities. Negative effects on cash included a $411 million reduction in long term debt proceeds from the year ago period, and a $358 million reduction in proceeds from the issuance of common stock. The reduction in common stock proceeds was due to the issuance of 7.4 million shares in the 2005 period related to the settlement of a stock purchase obligation in Amerens adjustable conversion rate equity security units. UE had a net use of cash for financing activities in 2006, compared with a net source of cash in 2005. The absence of long term debt issuances in 2006, compared with $643 million of long term debt issuances in 2005, was the primary reason for the change. This negative effect on cash flow was reduced by net changes in short term debt that resulted in a $154 million positive effect on cash in 2006, compared with a $295 million negative effect on cash in 2005. In addition, dividend payments decreased $31 million in the 2006 period from 2005, and net money pool borrowings increased $79 million. Cash from financing activities in 2006 was used principally to fund CT acquisitions. CIPS cash used in financing activities decreased in 2006, compared with 2005, principally because of the issuance of $61 million of long term debt that was used with other available corporate funds to repay CIPS outstanding balance on the intercompany note payable to UE. That note was originally issued as 50% of the consideration for UEs Illinois service territory, which was transferred to CIPS in 2005. Cash was also positively affected by a $64 million net decrease in money pool repayments and borrowings of $35 million under the 2006 $500 million credit facility in 2006. A $15 million increase in dividends to Ameren negatively affected CIPS cash from financing activities in 2006. Genco had a net decrease in cash used in financing activities for 2006, compared with 2005, principally because of $200 million of capital contributions received in 2006 from Ameren. These capital contributions were made to reduce Gencos money pool borrowings. In 2005, Genco used the $241 million from the sale of CTs to UE along with other funds to retire $225 million of maturing debt and to make principal payments on intercompany notes with CIPS and Ameren. Reducing these positive effects on cash was a $25 million increase in dividend payments in 2006. CILCORP had a net use of cash in 2006, compared with a net source of cash in 2005. CILCOs cash provided by financing activities decreased in 2006. Net money pool repayments increased $142 million at CILCORP and $145 million at CILCO. CILCORPs net repayments of $113 million on its note payable to Ameren reduced its 53 Table of Contents financing cash flow by $227 million, because 2005 included net borrowings on this note that provided CILCORP with cash. Positive effects on cash flow included long term debt issuances that generated $96 million in 2006, compared with no long term debt issuances in 2005. The proceeds from this debt were used to redeem $21 million of long term debt and to reduce money pool borrowings. In addition, CILCORP borrowed $215 million and CILCO (and CILCOs subsidiary AERG) borrowed $165 million under the 2006 $500 million credit facility, net of repayments. In 2006, CILCORP used cash of $33 million for redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt, compared with $101 million in the 2005 period. CILCOs cash used for redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt was comparable in the two years. These positive effects on cash in 2006 were partially offset by the absence in 2006 of a $102 million capital contribution received in 2005 from Ameren, which was made to reduce CILCOs short term debt. Also contributing to CILCORPs and CILCOs increase in cash used in financing activities for 2006 were increased common stock dividends of $20 million at CILCORP and $45 million at CILCO. IP had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2006, compared with a net use of cash in 2005. This was partly because of lower redemptions and repurchases of long term debt of $70 million in 2006. More debt was repaid in 2005 to improve IPs credit profile. Other positive effects on cash from financing activities included the absence in 2006 of $76 million of common stock dividend payments made in 2005, net borrowings of $75 million on the 2006 $500 million credit facility, and the issuance of $75 million of long term debt in 2006 compared with no long term debt proceeds in 2005. The $75 million was used to reduce money pool borrowings. Short term Borrowings and Liquidity Short term borrowings typically consist of drawings under committed bank credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. See Note 4 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on credit facilities, short term borrowing activity, relevant interest rates, and borrowings under Amerens utility and non state regulated subsidiary money pool arrangements. The following table presents the various committed bank credit facilities of the Ameren Companies and AERG, and their availability as of December 31, 2007: Credit Facility Expiration Amount Committed Amount Available Ameren, UE and Genco: Multiyear revolving(a)(b) July 2010 $ 1,150 $ 409 CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG: 2006 Multiyear revolving(c) January 2010 500 120 2007 Multiyear revolving(d) January 2010 500 60 (a) Ameren Companies may access this credit facility through intercompany borrowing arrangements. (b) See Note 4 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for discussion of the amendment of this facility. (c) The maximum amount available to each borrower at December 31, 2007, including for issuance of letters of credit, was limited as follows: CIPS $135 million, CILCORP $50 million, CILCO $75 million, IP $150 million and AERG $200 million. In July 2007, CILCO shifted $75 million of its capacity under this facility to the 2007 $500 million credit facility. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2007, CILCO had a sublimit of $75 million under this facility and a $75 million sublimit under the 2007 credit facility. See Note 4 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of this credit facility. (d) The maximum amount available to each borrower at December 31, 2007, including for the issuance of letters of credit, was limited as follows: CILCORP $125 million, CILCO $75 million, IP $200 million and AERG $100 million. CIPS and CILCO have the option of permanently reducing their ability to borrow under the 2006 $500 million credit facility and shifting such capacity, up to the same limits, to the 2007 $500 million credit facility. In July 2007, CILCO shifted $75 million of its sublimit under the 2006 $500 million credit facility to this facility. Ameren can directly borrow under the $1.15 billion facility, as amended, up to the entire amount of the facility. UE can directly borrow under this facility up to $500 million on a 364 day basis. Genco can directly borrow under this facility up to $150 million on a 364 day basis. The amended facility will terminate on July 14, 2010, with respect to Ameren. The termination date for UE and Genco is July 10, 2008, subject to the annual 364 day renewal provisions of the facility. This facility was also available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short term borrowing authorizations, by EEI or other Ameren non state regulated subsidiaries through direct short term borrowings from Ameren and by most of Amerens non rate regulated subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Ameren Services, Resources Company, Genco, AERG, Marketing Company and AFS, through a non state regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to coordinate and to provide for certain short term cash and working capital requirements. Separate money pools are maintained for utility and non state regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services enables IP to make short term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money pool agreement, together with any outstanding external short 54 Table of Contents term borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500 million, pursuant to authorization from the ICC. IP is not currently borrowing under the unilateral borrowing agreement. Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the money pool agreements. See Note 4 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement. In addition to committed credit facilities, a further source of liquidity for the Ameren Companies from time to time is available cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2007, Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP had $355 million, $185 million, $26 million, $2 million, $6 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. The issuance of short term debt securities by Amerens utility subsidiaries is subject to approval by FERC under the Federal Power Act. In March 2006, FERC issued an order authorizing these utility subsidiaries to issue short term debt securities subject to the following limits on outstanding balances: UE $1 billion, CIPS $250 million, and CILCO $250 million. The authorization was effective as of April 1, 2006, and terminates on March 31, 2008. An application for renewal of this authorization through March 31, 2010, is pending with FERC. IP has unlimited short term debt authorization from FERC. Genco is authorized by a March 2006 FERC order to have up to $300 million of short term debt outstanding at any time. In the application to FERC for renewal authorization referred to above, Genco has requested to increase its short term debt authorization to $500 million. AERG and EEI have unlimited short term debt authorization from FERC. The issuance of short term unsecured debt securities by Ameren and CILCORP is not subject to approval by any regulatory body. The Ameren Companies continually evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of their credit arrangements given changing business conditions. When business conditions warrant, changes may be made to existing credit agreements or other short term borrowing arrangements. Long term Debt and Equity The following table presents the issuances of common stock and the issuances, redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt and preferred stock (net of any issuance discounts and including any redemption premiums) for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005 for the Ameren Companies and EEI.

Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at Amerens option, newly issued shares, treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Ameren is also currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under its 401(k) plan pursuant to an effective SEC Form S 8 registration statement. Under DRPlus and its 401(k) plan (including subsidiary plans that are now merged into the Ameren 401(k) plan), Ameren issued 1.7 million, ($91 million) shares of common stock in 2007, 1.9 million ($96 million) in 2006, and 2.1 million ($109 million) in 2005. Ameren, UE and CIPS may sell all or a portion of the remaining securities registered under their effective registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant such a sale. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus that meets the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants See Note 4 Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the covenants and provisions contained in our bank credit facilities and applicable cross default provisions. Also see Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions 56 Table of Contents contained in certain of the Ameren Companies indenture agreements and articles of incorporation. At December 31, 2007, the Ameren Companies were in compliance with their credit facility, indenture, and articles of incorporation provisions and covenants. We consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows. Inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses. After assessing our current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets or make access to the capital markets uncertain or limited. Such events would increase our cost of capital or adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. Dividends Ameren paid to its shareholders common stock dividends totaling $527 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2007, $522 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2006, and $511 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2005. This resulted in a payout rate based on net income of 85% in 2007, 95% in 2006, and 84% in 2005. Dividends paid to common shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the same periods were 48% in 2007, 41% in 2006 and 41% in 2005. The amount and timing of dividends payable on Amerens common stock are within the sole discretion of Amerens board of directors. The board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends. However, the board considers various issues, including Amerens historical earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, projected cash flow and potential cash flow requirements, dividend payout rates at other utilities, return on investments with similar risk characteristics, impacts of regulatory orders or legislation and overall business considerations. On February 8, 2008, Amerens board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 63.5 cents per share payable on March 31, 2008, to shareholders of record on March 5, 2008. Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the Ameren Companies payment of dividends. UE would be restricted as to dividend payments on its common and preferred stock if it were to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures. CIPS articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Gencos indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making any dividend payments on common stock if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold. CILCORP has common and preferred stock dividend payment restrictions if leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met, or if CILCORPs senior long term debt does not have the ratings described in its indenture. CILCO has restrictions in its articles of incorporation on dividend payments on common stock relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock and amounts to be set aside for any sinking fund retirement of its 5.85% Series preferred stock. At December 31, 2007, except as described below with respect to the 2007 $500 million credit facility and the 2006 $500 million credit facility, none of these conditions existed at the Ameren Companies, and as a result, they were allowed to pay dividends. The ICC requires IP to have a dividend policy comparable to that of Amerens other Illinois utilities and consistent with achieving and maintaining a common equity to total capitalization ratio between 50% and 60%. The 2007 $500 million credit facility and the 2006 $500 million credit facility limit CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP to common and preferred stock dividend payments of $10 million per year each if CIPS, CILCOs or IPs senior secured long term debt securities or first mortgage bonds, or CILCORPs senior unsecured long term debt securities, have received a below investment grade credit rating from either Moodys or SP. With respect to AERG, which currently is not rated by Moodys or SP, the common and preferred stock dividend restriction will not apply if its ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated operating cash flow, pursuant to a calculation defined in the facilities, is less than or equal to 3.0 to 1. On July 26, 2006, Moodys downgraded CILCORPs senior unsecured credit rating to below investment grade, causing it to be subject to this dividend payment limitation. As of December 31, 2007, AERG was in compliance with the debt to operating cash flow ratio test in the 2007 and 2006 $500 million credit facilities and therefore able to pay dividends. The other borrowers thereunder are not currently limited in their dividend payments by this provision of the 2007 or 2006 $500 million credit facilities. 57 Table of Contents The following table presents dividends paid by Ameren Corporation and by Amerens subsidiaries to their respective parents. 2007 2006 2005 UE $ 267 $ 249 $ 280 CIPS 40 50 35 Genco 113 113 88 CILCORP(a) 50 30 IP 61 76 Nonregistrants 46 60 2 Dividends paid by Ameren $ 527 $ 522 $ 511 (a) CILCO paid to CILCORP dividends of $ million, $65 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Certain of the Ameren Companies have issued preferred stock on which they are obligated to make preferred dividend payments. Each companys board of directors considers the declaration of the preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which the dividend is payable and the amount to be paid. See Note 8 Stockholder Rights Plan and Preferred Stock to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred stock issuances. Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007.

(e) Amounts related to certain real estate leases and railroad licenses have indefinite payment periods. The $1 million annual obligation for these items is included in the Less than 1 Year, 1 3 Years, and 3 5 Years columns.

The Ameren Companies adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes on January 1, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits under the provisions of FIN 48 were $116 million, $26 million, $ million, $40 million, $19 million, $19 million and $ million for Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP, respectively. It is reasonably possible to expect that the settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit will result in an underpayment or overpayment of tax and related interest. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the timing of cash payments or receipts associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The amount and timing of certain payments is not reliably estimable or determinable at this time. See Note 11 Income Taxes for information regarding the Ameren Companies unrecognized tax benefits and related liabilities for interest expense. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2007, none of the Ameren Companies had any off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of 59 Table of Contents business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future. Credit Ratings The following table presents the principal credit ratings of the Ameren Companies by Moodys, SP and Fitch effective on the date of this report: Moodys SP Fitch Ameren: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa2 BBB BBB+ Senior unsecured debt Baa2 BB+ BBB+ Commercial paper P 2 A 3 F2 UE: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa1 BBB A Secured debt A3 BBB A+ Commercial paper P 2 A 3 F2 CIPS: Issuer/corporate credit rating Ba1 BB BB+ Secured debt Baa3 BBB BBB Genco: Issuer/corporate credit rating BBB BBB+ Senior unsecured debt Baa2 BBB BBB+ CILCORP: Issuer/corporate credit rating BB BB+ Senior unsecured debt Ba2 B+ BB+ CILCO: Issuer/corporate credit rating Ba1 BB BB+ Secured debt Baa2 BBB BBB IP: Issuer/corporate credit rating Ba1 BB BB+ Secured debt Baa3 BBB BBB During March and April of 2007, Moodys, SP, and Fitch downgraded various credit ratings of certain of the Ameren Companies. Depending on the specific credit rating agency action and the specific legal entities affected, the downgrade of these credit ratings was a result of the actions of various Illinois state legislators, including consideration of forms of legislation that would have rolled back and frozen the electric rates of CIPS, CILCO and IP. In the case of UE, this downgrade was prompted by higher costs, lower financial metrics, and a continued challenging regulatory environment in Missouri. On June 8, 2007, Fitch changed the rating outlook at UE to negative due to the combined effect of the receipt of less than expected rate relief and a sizable capital expenditure program. On August 1, 2007, Fitch changed the rating outlook at Ameren to stable. In addition, Fitch revised the rating watch on CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP to positive. The positive watch followed the announcement of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. On August 29, 2007, SP issued a research update in response to the Illinois electric settlement agreement. The outlook on the ratings of Ameren, UE and Genco was changed to stable. The outlook on the ratings of CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP was upgraded to positive. On September 6, 2007, SP upgraded its senior secured debt ratings of UE, CIPS, and CILCO from BBB to BBB as a result of changes in its first mortgage bond rating methodology. On August 29, 2007, Moodys changed the rating outlook at Ameren and Genco to stable. The rating outlook of CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP was upgraded to positive. These actions were prompted by the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Moodys stated that the settlement significantly reduces the likelihood of a rate freeze being enacted in Illinois and provides the foundation for a potentially improving political and regulatory environment for investor owned utilities in the state. On February 12, 2008, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Ameren and Genco but changed their rating outlook to negative from stable. Moodys placed the long term credit ratings of UE under review for possible downgrade and affirmed UEs commercial paper rating. In addition, Moodys affirmed the ratings of CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP and maintained a positive rating outlook on these four companies. According to Moodys, the review of UEs ratings was prompted by declining cash flow coverage metrics, increased operating costs, higher capital expenditures for environmental compliance and transmission and distribution system investment, and significant regulatory lag in the recovery of these costs. Moodys stated that the negative outlook on the credit rating of Genco reflected Gencos position as a predominantly coal generating company that is likely to be seriously affected by more stringent environmental regulations, including a potential cap or tax on carbon emissions. The negative outlook on the ratings of Ameren, according to Moodys, reflects the factors that impacted its subsidiaries, UE and Genco. Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. Such changes may also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel, power and gas supply, among other things, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. Collateral postings and prepayments made as of the end of 2007 were $56 million, $5 million, $8 million, $14 million, $14 million, and $21 million at Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP, respectively, resulting from our reduced issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings. At December 31, 2007, a reduction to sub investment grade issuer or senior unsecured debt ratings (lower than BBB or Baa3), could have resulted in Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO or IP being required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to $176 million, $65 million, $13 million, $43 million, $29 million, $29 million, and $12 million, 60 Table of Contents respectively. In addition, the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can increase or decrease depending upon the credit ratings of the borrower. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. It should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk under Part II, Item 7A, for information on credit rating changes with respect to insured tax exempt auction rate bonds. OUTLOOK Below are some key trends that may affect the Ameren Companies financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in 2008 and beyond. Revenues The earnings of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are largely determined by the regulation of their rates by state agencies. With rising costs, including fuel and related transportation, purchased power, labor, material, depreciation and financing costs coupled with increased capital and operations and maintenance expenditures targeted at enhanced distribution system reliability and environmental compliance, Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP expect to experience regulatory lag until requests to increase rates to recover such costs are granted by state regulators. Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP expect to be entering a period where more frequent rate cases will be necessary. UE expects to file its next electric rate case in Missouri during the second quarter of 2008. The Ameren Illinois Utilities filed delivery service rate cases with the ICC in November 2007 due to inadequate recovery of costs and low returns on equity of less than 5% experienced in 2007 and expected in 2008. CIPS, CILCO and IP requested to increase their annual revenues for electric delivery service by $180 million in the aggregate (CIPS $31 million, CILCO $10 million, and IP $139 million). The electric rate increase requests were based on an 11% return on equity, a capital structure composed of 51% to 53% equity, an aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of $2.1 billion and a test year ended December 31, 2006, with certain prospective updates. In addition, CIPS, CILCO and IP filed requests with the ICC in November 2007 to increase their annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by $67 million in the aggregate (CIPS $15 million increase, CILCO $4 million decrease, and IP $56 million increase). The natural gas rate change requests were based on an 11% return on equity, a capital structure composed of 51% to 53% equity, an aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of $0.9 billion and a test year ended December 31, 2006, with certain prospective updates. The ICC has until the end of September 2008 to render a decision in these rate cases. In current and future rate cases, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP will also seek cost recovery mechanisms from their state regulators to reduce regulatory lag. In their electric and natural gas delivery service rate cases filed in November 2007, the Ameren Illinois Utilities requested ICC approval to implement rate adjustment mechanisms for bad debt expenses, electric infrastructure investments, and the decoupling of natural gas revenues from sales volumes. In July 2005, a law was enacted that enables the MoPSC to put in place fuel and purchased power and environmental cost recovery mechanisms for Missouris utilities. Rules for the fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in September 2006. Rules for the environmental cost recovery mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in February 2008 and will be effective once published in the Missouri Register. UE will not be able to use these cost recovery mechanisms until authorized by the MoPSC as part of a rate case proceeding. The MoPSC denied UE the use of a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism in its 2007 rate order. UE plans to request use of a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism and, potentially an environmental cost recovery mechanism, in its next electric rate case filing. Average residential electric rates for CIPS, CILCO and IP increased significantly following the expiration of a rate freeze at the end of 2006. Electric rates rose because of the increased cost of power purchased on behalf of the Ameren Illinois Utilities customers and an increase in electric delivery service rates. Due to the magnitude of these increases, the Illinois electric settlement agreement reached in 2007 provides approximately $1 billion over a four year period that began in 2007 to fund rate relief for certain electric customers in Illinois, including approximately $488 million to customers of the Ameren Illinois Utilities. Funding for the settlement will come from electric generators in Illinois and certain Illinois electric utilities. Pursuant to the Illinois electric settlement agreement, the Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco and AERG agreed to fund an aggregate of $150 million, of which the following contributions remain to be made as of December 31, 2007: CILCO (Illinois CILCO Ameren CIPS Regulated) IP Genco (AERG) 2008(a) $ 42.9 $ 6.4 $ 3.2 $ 8.4 $ 17.2 $ 7.7 2009(a) 26.5 3.9 1.9 4.9 10.9 4.9 2010(a) 1.7 0.2 0.1 0.4 0.7 0.3 Total $ 71.1 $ 10.5 $ 5.2 $ 13.7 $ 28.8 $ 12.9 (a) Estimated. To fund these contributions, the Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco and AERG will need to increase their respective borrowings. As part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, the reverse auction used for power procurement in Illinois was discontinued. It will be replaced with a new power procurement process to be led by the IPA, beginning in 2009. In 2008, utilities will contract for necessary power and energy requirements primarily through a request for proposal process, subject to ICC review and 61 Table of Contents approval. The ICC approved the proposed 2008 power procurement plans of the Ameren Illinois Utilities in December 2007. Existing supply contracts from the September 2006 reverse auction remain in place. The Ameren Illinois Utilities power procurement costs are passed directly to its customers. The impact of the new procurement process in Illinois is uncertain. Also as part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, the Ameren Illinois Utilities entered into financial contracts with Marketing Company (for the benefit of Genco and AERG), to lock in energy prices for 400 to 1,000 megawatts annually of their around the clock power requirements during the period June 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012, at then relevant market prices. These financial contracts do not include capacity, are not load following products and do not involve the physical delivery of energy. The MoPSC issued an order, as clarified, granting UE a $43 million increase in base rates for electric service with new electric rates effective June 4, 2007. This order included provisions to extend UEs Callaway nuclear plant and fossil generation plant lives and to change the income tax method associated with the cost of property removals. Such provisions are expected to decrease Amerens and UEs expenses by $58 million annually. The MoPSC also approved a stipulation and agreement authorizing an increase in UEs annual natural gas delivery revenues of $6 million, effective April 1, 2007. UE agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate case before March 15, 2010. Volatile power prices in the Midwest affect the amount of revenues Ameren, UE, Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI can generate by marketing power into the wholesale and spot markets and influence the cost of power purchased in the spot markets. The availability and performance of UEs, Gencos, AERGs and EEIs electric generation fleet can materially impact their revenues. Genco and AERG are seeking to raise the equivalent availability and capacity factors of their power plants over the long term through greater investments and a process improvement program. The Non rate regulated Generation segment expects to generate 33 million megawatthours of power in 2008 (Genco 18 million, AERG 7 million, EEI 8 million), 31 million megawatthours in 2009 (Genco 15 million, AERG 8 million, EEI 8 million) and 33 million megawatthours in 2010 (Genco 18 million, AERG 7 million, EEI 8 million). All but 5 million megawatthours of Genco and AERGs pre 2006 wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements expired during 2006. In 2007, 1 million megawatthours of these agreements, which had an average embedded selling price of $35 per megawatthour, expired. Another 2 million contracted megawatthours will expire in late 2008, which have an average embedded selling price of $33 per megawatthour. These agreements are being replaced with market based sales. The marketing strategy for Non rate regulated Generation is to optimize generation output in a low risk manner to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility, while capitalizing on its low cost generation fleet to provide solid, sustainable returns. Through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts, including contracts resulting from the Illinois 2006 power procurement auction and the Illinois electric settlement agreement, Marketing Company sold as of December 31, 2007, approximately 86% of Non rate regulated Generations expected 2008 generation at an average price of $50 per megawatthour (fiscal year 2009 60%, at an average price of $52 per megawatthour; fiscal year 2010 45%, at an average price of $54 per megawatthour). The future development of ancillary services and capacity markets in MISO could increase the electric margins of UE, Genco, AERG and EEI. Ancillary services are services necessary to support the transmission of energy from generation resources to loads while maintaining reliable operation of the transmission providers system. In February 2008, FERC conditionally accepted the ancillary services market tariff proposed by MISO. We expect Non rate regulated Generations ancillary services market revenues to increase to $15 million in 2008 from $5 million realized in 2007. Ancillary services market revenues are allocated to Genco and AERG based on their generation in accordance with their power supply agreements with Marketing Company. We expect MISO will begin development of a capacity market once its ancillary services market is in place. A capacity market allows participants to purchase or sell capacity products that meet reliability requirements. MISO is currently in the process of developing a centralized regional wholesale ancillary services market, which is expected to begin during 2008. We expect capacity and energy prices to strengthen from current levels because of improving market liquidity and decreasing reserve margins in MISO. Non rate regulated Generations capacity revenues are expected to increase to approximately $40 million in 2008 from $25 million in 2007. EEI receives payment for 100% of its capacity sales under its power supply agreement with Marketing Company. Capacity revenues are allocated to Genco and AERG based on their generation in accordance with their power supply agreements with Marketing Company. We expect continued economic growth in our service territory and market area to benefit energy demand in 2008 and beyond, but higher energy prices could result in reduced demand from customers, especially in Illinois. Future energy efficiency programs developed by UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP and others could also result in reduced demand for our electric generation and our electric and gas transmission and distribution services. Fuel and Purchased Power In 2007, 84% of Amerens electric generation (UE 76%, Genco 96%, AERG 99%, EEI 100%) was supplied by coal fired power plants. About 94% of the coal used by these plants (UE 97%, Genco 88%, 62 Table of Contents AERG 92%, EEI 100%) was delivered by railroads from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. In the past, deliveries from the Powder River Basin have been restricted because of rail maintenance, weather, and derailments. As of December 31, 2007, coal inventories for UE, Genco, AERG and EEI were adequate, and in excess of historical levels, but below targeted levels. Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause UE, Genco, AERG and EEI to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low margin periods, buying higher cost fuels to generate required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources. Amerens fuel costs (including transportation) are expected to increase in 2008 and beyond. Fuel costs for both Missouri Regulated and Non rate regulated Generation are expected to increase approximately 35% from 2007 to 2010. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 94%, 86% and 54% of Missouri Regulateds estimated fuel costs for 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, were priced hedged. Approximately 98%, 72% and 16% of Non rate regulated Generations estimated fuel costs for 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, were price hedged. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this report for additional information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for 2008 through 2012. Other Costs In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility. This resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which damaged a state park. In January 2008, the Circuit Court of Reynolds County, Missouri, approved UEs November 2007 settlement agreement with the state of Missouri resolving the states lawsuit and claims for damages and other relief related to the breach. In addition, pursuant to the settlement agreement, UE is required to replace the breached upper reservoir with a new reservoir, subject to FERC authorization. UE received approval from FERC to rebuild the upper reservoir in August 2007 and hired a contractor in November 2007. The estimated cost to rebuild the upper reservoir is in the range of $450 million. UE expects the Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility to be out of service through at least the fall of 2009, if not longer. UE believes that substantially all of the damages and liabilities caused by the breach, including costs related to the settlement agreement with the state of Missouri, the cost of rebuilding the plant, and the cost of replacement power, up to $8 million annually, will be covered by insurance. Insurance will not cover lost electric margins and penalties paid to FERC. Under UEs insurance policies, all claims by or against UE are subject to review by its insurance carriers. As a result of this breach, UE is engaged in litigation initiated by certain private parties. We are unable to predict the timing, or outcomes of this litigation, or its possible effect on UEs results of operation, financial position or liquidity. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of Taum Sauk matters. UEs Callaway nuclear plants next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in the fall of 2008 is expected to last 25 to 30 days. During a scheduled outage, which occurs every 18 months, maintenance and purchased power costs increase, and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases, versus non outage years. Over the next few years, we expect rising employee benefit costs as well as higher insurance and security costs associated with additional measures we have taken, or may need to take, at UEs Callaway nuclear plant and at our other facilities. Insurance premiums may also increase as a result of the Taum Sauk incident, among other things. Bad debts may increase due to rising electric and gas rates. As we refinance our short term and variable rate debt into fixed rate debt, financing costs may increase. We are currently undertaking cost reduction and control initiatives associated with the strategic sourcing of purchases and streamlining of all aspects of our business. Capital Expenditures The EPA has issued more stringent emission limits on all coal fired power plants. Between 2008 and 2017, Ameren expects that certain Ameren Companies will be required to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion to retrofit their power plants with pollution control equipment. Costs for these types of projects continue to escalate. These investments will also result in decreased plant availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately 45% of this investment will be in Amerens regulated UE operations, and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts expended in non rate regulated operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions reflecting increased environmental costs for generators. Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force Ameren and other similarly situated electric power generators to close some coal fired facilities. In December 2007, Ameren issued a report on how it is responding to the rising regulatory, competitive, and public pressure to significantly reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions from current and proposed power plant operations. The report included Amerens climate change strategy and activities, current greenhouse gas emissions, and analysis with respect to plausible future greenhouse gas scenarios; it is available on Amerens 63 Table of Contents Web site. Investments to control carbon emissions at Amerens coal fired plants would significantly increase future capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses. UE continues to evaluate its longer term needs for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity. At this time, UE does not expect to require new baseload generation capacity until 2018 to 2020. However, due to the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload power plant, UE is actively studying future plant alternatives, including those that would use coal or nuclear fuel. In 2007, UE signed an agreement with UniStar Nuclear to assist UE in the preparation of a combined construction and operating license application (COLA) for filing with the NRC. A COLA describes how a nuclear plant would be designed, constructed and operated. In addition, UE has also signed contracts for certain long lead time equipment. Preparing that COLA and entering into these contracts does not mean a decision has been made to build a nuclear plant. These are only the first steps in the regulatory licensing and procurement process. UE and UniStar Nuclear must submit the COLA to the NRC in 2008 to be eligible for incentives available under provisions of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. We cannot predict whether or when the NRC will approve the COLA. UE intends to submit a license extension application with the NRC to extend its Callaway nuclear plants operating license by twenty years so that the operating license will expire in 2044. UE cannot predict whether or when the NRC will approve the license extension. Over the next few years, we expect to make significant investments in our electric and gas infrastructure and to incur increased operations and maintenance expenses to improve overall system reliability. We are projecting higher labor and material costs for these capital expenditures. UE announced in July 2007 plans to spend $300 million over three years for underground cabling and reliability improvement, $135 million ($45 million per year) for tree trimming, and $84 million over three years (approximately $28 million per year) for circuit and device inspection and repair. We would expect these costs or investments to be ultimately recovered in rates. Increased investments for environmental compliance, reliability improvement, and new baseload capacity will result in higher depreciation and financing costs. The Ameren Companies will incur significant capital expenditures over the next five years for compliance with environmental regulations and to make significant investments in their electric and gas utility infrastructure to improve overall system reliability. Expenditures are expected to be funded primarily with debt. Other As required by the MoPSC, UE filed a study in November 2007 with the MoPSC evaluating the costs and benefits of UEs participation in MISO. This case is currently pending. UEs filing noted that there were a number of uncertainties associated with the cost benefit study, including issues associated with the UE MISO service agreement. If some of these uncertainties are ultimately resolved in a manner adverse to UE, it could call into question whether it is cost effective for UE to remain in MISO. UE has advised MISO of its intent to withdraw from MISO as of December 31, 2008, in order to preserve the option to withdraw based on the outcome of the pending MoPSC proceeding. It is uncertain when or how the MoPSC will rule on UEs MISO cost benefit study or, if UE were to withdraw from MISO, what the effect of such a withdrawal would be on UE. The above items could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase Amerens shareholder value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed. The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. REGULATORY MATTERS See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. ACCOUNTING MATTERS Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. Our application of these policies involves judgments regarding many factors which in and of themselves could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. We have outlined below the critical accounting policies that we believe are most difficult, subjective or complex. Any change in 64 Table of Contents the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results. Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery All of the Ameren Companies, except Genco, defer costs as regulatory assets in accordance with SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and make investments that they assume will be collected in future rates. Regulatory environment and external regulatory decisions and requirements Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact Impact of deregulation, rate freezes, and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs Basis for Judgment We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. If facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is probably no longer recoverable, we record a charge to earnings, which could be material. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for quantification of these assets by registrant. Environmental Costs We accrue for all known environmental contamination where remediation can be reasonably estimated, but some of our operations have existed for over 100 years and previous contamination may be unknown to us. Extent of contamination Responsible party determination Approved methods for cleanup Present and future legislation and governmental regulations and standards Results of ongoing research and development regarding environmental impacts Basis for Judgment We determine the proper amounts to accrue for known environmental contamination by using estimates of cleanup costs in the context of current remediation standards and available technology. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for disclosure on quantified environmental costs, to the extent possible. Unbilled Revenue At the end of each period, we project expected usage, and we estimate the amount of revenue to record for services that have been billed. Projecting customer energy usage Estimating impacts of weather and other usage affecting factors provided to customers but not yet for the unbilled period Estimating loss of energy during transmission and delivery Basis for Judgment We base our estimate of unbilled revenue each period on the volume of energy delivered, as valued by a model of billing cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class for our service area. This figure is then adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and weather variations based on historical results. See balance sheets under Part II, Item 8, of this report for unbilled revenue amounts for each registrant. Valuation of Goodwill, Long Lived Assets, and Asset Retirement Obligations We assess the carrying value of our goodwill and long lived assets to determine whether they are impaired. We also review for the existence of asset retirement obligations. If an asset retirement obligation is identified, we determine its fair value and subsequently reassess and adjust the obligation, as necessary. Managements identification of impairment indicators Changes in business, industry, laws, technology, or economic and market conditions. Valuation assumptions and conclusions Estimated useful lives of our significant long lived assets Actions or assessments by our regulators Identification of an asset retirement obligation 65 Table of Contents Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Basis for Judgment Annually, or whenever events indicate a valuation may have changed, we use various valuation methodologies to determine valuations, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples, and discounted, undiscounted, and probabilistic discounted cash flow models with multiple scenarios. The identification of asset retirement obligations is conducted through the review of legal documents and interviews. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for quantification of our goodwill assets. Benefit Plan Accounting Based on actuarial calculations, we accrue costs of providing future employee benefits in accordance with SFAS Nos. 87, 106, 112 and 158, which provide guidance on benefit plan accounting. See Note 9 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations Health care cost trend rates Timing of employee retirements and mortality assumptions Ability to recover certain benefit plan costs from our rate payers Basis for Judgment Our ultimate selection of the discount rate, health care trend rate, and expected rate of return on pension assets is based on our review of available historical, current, and projected rates, as applicable. See Note 9 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for sensitivity of Amerens benefit plans to potential changes in these assumptions. Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Nonretail electric rates are regulated by FERC. Adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that reviews a historical period. As a result, revenue increases will lag behind changing prices. Inflation affects our operations, earnings, stockholders equity, and financial performance. The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers. As a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years. Our Non rate regulated Generation businesses do not have regulated recovery mechanisms. In UEs Missouri electric utility jurisdiction, there is currently no tariff for adjusting rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of purchased power. However, in July 2005, a law was enacted that enables the MoPSC to put in place cost recovery mechanisms for fuel and purchased power and for environmental costs at Missouris utilities. Rules for the fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in September 2006. Rules for the environmental cost recovery mechanism were approved by the MoPSC in February 2008 and will be effective once published in the Missouri Register. UE will not be able to use these cost recovery mechanisms until so authorized by the MoPSC as part of a rate case proceeding. In its rate case filed in July 2006, UE was denied use of a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism. UE plans to request use of a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism, and potentially an environmental cost recovery mechanism, in its next electric rate case filing. Effective January 2, 2007, ICC approved tariffs in Illinois allow CIPS, CILCO and IP to recover power supply costs by adjusting rates to accommodate changes in power prices. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on the Illinois electric rate settlement agreement that addressed legislative and other efforts to limit full recovery of power costs in Illinois. In our Missouri and Illinois retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in 66 Table of Contents billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. As part of a stipulation and agreement, effective April 1, 2007, UE has agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate case before March 15, 2010. This agreement did not prevent UE from filing to recover gas infrastructure replacement costs through an ISRS during this three year rate moratorium. In February 2008, the MoPSC approved UEs petition requesting the establishment of an ISRS, to recover annual revenues of $1 million effective March 29, 2008. UE, Genco, CILCORP and AERG are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent that they must purchase natural gas to run CTs. These companies have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins, and to minimize the impact to their financial statements. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, below for further information. Also see Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information on the cost recovery mechanisms discussed above, as well as rate related recovery mechanisms being sought by the Ameren Illinois Utilities in their pending rate cases with the ICC. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument, derivative or nonderivative, caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates, commodity prices, and equity security prices. A derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value of some underlying asset. The following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. We handle market risks in accordance with established policies, which may include entering into various derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks, principally business, legal and operational risks, are not part of the following discussion. Our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets and to pursue market opportunities within prudent risk parameters. Our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee, which is composed of senior level Ameren officers. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with: long term and short term variable rate debt; fixed rate debt; commercial paper; and auction rate long term debt. We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we have within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. The following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by 1% on variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2007: Interest Expense Net Income(a) Ameren $ 23 $ (14 ) UE 5 (3 ) CIPS 2 (1 ) Genco 1 (b ) CILCORP 5 (3 ) CILCO 4 (2 ) IP 5 (3 ) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Less than $1 million. The estimated changes above do not consider potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would probably act to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. Insured Tax exempt Auction Rate Bonds Our tax exempt environmental improvement and pollution control revenue auction rate bonds issued for the benefit of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP through governmental authorities are insured by monoline bond insurers. See Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a description and details of the tax exempt environmental improvement and pollution control revenue bonds issued for the benefit of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. Monoline bond insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when an issuer defaults; as a result, such securities typically receive the highest investment grade ratings from the credit rating agencies, which reflect the credit ratings of the monoline bond insurers. UE has an aggregate of $437 million principal amount of insured tax exempt auction rate bonds ($229 million insured by XL Capital Ltd., $208 million insured by MBIA Inc.). CIPS has $35 million principal amount of insured tax exempt auction 67 Table of Contents rate bonds insured by XL Capital Ltd. CILCO has $19 million principal amount of insured tax exempt auction rate bonds insured by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. IP has an aggregate of $337 million principal amount of insured tax exempt auction rate bonds ($150 million insured by MBIA Inc., $187 million insured by Ambac Financial Group, Inc.). Our insured tax exempt auction rate bonds bear interest at rates determined pursuant to auctions conducted every seven or 35 days, depending on the particular series of securities. As a result of developments in the capital markets with respect to residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, the credit rating agencies have placed some of the monoline bond insurers on review for a possible downgrade or have actually downgraded their credit ratings due to their insuring of such securities. As a result, since December 2007, the insured tax exempt bonds that are guaranteed by the monoline bond insurers have similarly been placed on review for possible downgrade or have been downgraded. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. It should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. As a result of these actions by the credit rating agencies with respect to monoline bond insurers and a lack of liquidity in the auction rate market, we believe the interest rates on certain of our insured tax exempt auction rate bonds are higher than they would have been in the absence of such actions. It is possible that the credit rating agencies may continue to take steps to further downgrade the credit ratings of the monoline bond insurers as well as our tax exempt bonds insured by such insurers and any such further negative actions could result in higher interest rates on our insured tax exempt auction rate bonds. Downgrades of the monoline bond insurers also increase the possibility of a failed auction, where there are not sufficient clearing bids in an auction to set the interest rate. A failed auction would result in the interest rates resetting to maximum interest rates ranging up to 18%, depending upon the series of bonds, until the next scheduled auction date at which time another attempt at a successful auction will be made. Between February 12 and 20, we experienced failed auctions with respect to a portion of our tax exempt auction rate bonds. According to press reports, many other series of tax exempt auction rate securities similarly experienced failed auctions. We are evaluating various options available to us, including refinancing with other instruments, to mitigate the effects of the ratings downgrades on the monoline insurers and the effects of these on the interest rates of our securities. Certain of these options would require approvals from state regulators and could result in higher expense. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted. NYMEX traded futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the NYMEX and have nominal credit risk. In all other transactions, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction. Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and executory contracts with market risk exposures. The risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base. At December 31, 2007, no nonaffiliated customer represented more than 10%, in the aggregate, of our accounts receivable. Our revenues are primarily derived from sales of electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and Illinois. UE, CIPS, Genco, AERG, IP, AFS, and Marketing Company may have credit exposure associated with interchange or wholesale purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2007, UEs, CIPS, Gencos, CILCOs, IPs, AFS, and Marketing Companys combined credit exposure to nonaffiliated non investment grade trading counterparties related to interchange or wholesale purchases and sales was less than $1 million, net of collateral (2006 less than $1 million). We establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program that involves daily exposure reporting to senior management, master trading and netting agreements, and credit support, such as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze each counterpartys financial condition before we enter into sales, forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts, and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged leases. We estimate our credit exposure to MISO associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market to be $63 million at December 31, 2007 (2006 $35 million). The Ameren Illinois Utilities will be exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the parties contributing to the Illinois comprehensive rate relief and assistance programs under the Illinois electric settlement agreement, which will provide $488 million in rate relief over a four year period to certain electric customers of the Ameren Illinois Utilities. Under funding agreements among the parties contributing to the rate relief and assistance programs, at the end of each month, the Ameren Illinois Utilities bill the participating generators for their proportionate share of that months rate relief and assistance, which is due in 30 days, or drawn from the funds provided by the generators escrow. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information. Equity Price Risk Our costs of providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, including the rate of return on plan assets. Ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in ERISA. Amerens goal is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment management to specialists in each asset class. 68 Table of Contents Where appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after an analysis of historical experience, future expectations, and the volatility of the various asset classes. After considering the target asset allocation for each asset class, we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared with benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets. In future years, the costs of such plans reflected in net income or OCI and cash contributions to the plans could increase materially, without pension asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 8.25%. UE also maintains a trust fund, as required by the NRC and Missouri law, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning. As of December 31, 2007, this fund was invested primarily in domestic equity securities (63%) and debt securities (36%) and totaled $307 million (in 2006 $285 million). By maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk. However, the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. The fixed rate, fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options. UEs exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated, because UE is currently allowed to recover through electric rates its decommissioning costs, which would include unfavorable investment results. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, and natural gas. UEs, Gencos, AERGs and EEIs risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements. Genco, AERG and EEI also seek to sell power forward to wholesale, municipal and industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices. We also attempt to mitigate financial risks through structured risk management programs and policies, which include structured forward hedging programs, and the use of derivative financial instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts, and financial swap contracts). However, a portion of the generation capacity of UE, Genco, AERG and EEI is not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices. The following table shows how our earnings might decrease if power prices were to decrease by 1% on unhedged economic generation for 2008 through 2012: Net Income(a) Ameren $ (22 ) UE (9 ) Genco (8 ) CILCO (AERG) (3 ) EEI (6 ) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. Ameren also uses its portfolio management and trading capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy risk capital to generate additional returns. Due to our physical presence in the market, we are able to identify and pursue opportunities which can generate additional returns through portfolio management and trading activities. All of this activity is performed within a controlled risk management process. We establish value at risk (VaR) and stop loss limits that are intended to prevent any negative material financial impact. Similar techniques are used to manage risks associated with changing prices of fuel for generation. Most UE, Genco and AERG fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts. UE, Genco and AERG do not have a provision similar to the PGA clause for electric operations, so UE, Genco and AERG have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal and nuclear fuel to manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility. Price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures, whereby the amount of coal purchased is determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year. We generally purchase coal up to five years in advance, but we may purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable deals or market conditions. The strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions. Transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs. We typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility. Natural gas transportation expenses for Amerens gas distribution utility companies and the gas fired generation units of UE, Genco, AERG and EEI are regulated by FERC through approved tariffs governing the rates, terms and conditions of transportation and storage services. Certain firm transportation and storage capacity agreements held by Ameren Companies include rights to extend the contracts prior to the termination of the primary term. Depending on our competitive position, we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariff rates for our requirements. 69 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired power plants, nuclear fuel for UEs Callaway nuclear plant, natural gas for our CTs and retail distribution, as appropriate, and purchased power needs of CIPS, CILCO and IP, which own no generation, that are price hedged over the five year period 2008 through 2012, as of December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2012 Ameren: Coal 100 % 92 % 34 % Coal transportation 100 82 17 Nuclear fuel 100 100 87 Natural gas for generation 44 1 Natural gas for distribution(a) 76 18 10 Purchased power for Illinois Regulated(b) 91 76 51 UE: Coal 100 % 86 % 37 % Coal transportation 100 96 31 Nuclear fuel 100 100 87 Natural gas for generation 25 Natural gas for distribution(a) 92 22 10 CIPS: Natural gas for distribution(a) 84 % 19 % 11 % Purchased power(b) 91 76 51 Genco: Coal 100 % 100 % 25 % Coal transportation 100 99 Natural gas for generation 90 CILCORP/CILCO: Coal (AERG) 92 % 85 % 26 % Coal transportation (AERG) 100 69 Natural gas for distribution(a) 71 17 9 Purchased power(b) 91 76 51 IP: Natural gas for distribution(a) 72 % 18 % 10 % Purchased power(b) 91 76 51 EEI: Coal 100 % 87 % 38 % Coal transportation 100 (a) Represents the percentage of natural gas price hedged for peak winter season of November through March. The year 2008 represents January 2008 through March 2008. The year 2009 represents November 2008 through March 2009. This continues each successive year through March 2012. (b) Represents the percentage of purchased power price hedged for fixed price residential and small commercial customers with less than 1 megawatt of demand as part of the Illinois power procurement auction held in early September 2006. Excluded from the percent hedged amount is purchased power for fixed price large commercial and industrial customers with 1 megawatt of demand or higher. Nearly all of these customers chose a third party supplier. Also excluded from the percent hedged amount is purchased power to serve large service real time pricing customers, which is purchased as needed. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of this matter and the new power procurement process pursuant to the Illinois electric settlement agreement. 70 Table of Contents The following table shows how our total fuel expense might increase and how our net income might decrease if coal and coal transportation costs were to increase by 1% on any requirements not currently covered by fixed price contracts for the five year period 2008 through 2012. In addition, coal and coal transportation costs are sensitive to the price of diesel fuel as a result of rail freight fuel surcharges. If diesel fuel costs were to increase by $0.25/gallon, Amerens fuel expense could increase by $13 million annually (UE $7 million, Genco $3 million, AERG $1 million and EEI $2 million). As of December 31, 2007, Ameren has price hedged approximately 75% of expected fuel surcharges in 2008.

(b) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries. In the event of a significant change in coal prices, UE, Genco and CILCO would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources. With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel, UE has fixed priced and base price with escalation agreements, or it uses inventories that provide some price hedge to fulfill its Callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services through 2008. There is no fuel reloading scheduled for 2009. UE has price hedges for 87% of the 2010 to 2012 nuclear fuel requirements. The nuclear fuel markets have undergone significant change. What was once a buyers market has become a sellers market; with increased potential for supply disruptions. UE has increased its desired inventories of nuclear fuel (with inherent price hedge) and has increased its forward contract coverage. New long term uranium contracts are almost exclusively market price related with an escalating price floor. New long term enrichment contracts usually have some market price related component. Therefore, nuclear fuel price increases are expected, and price hedging becomes less available. UE expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the Callaway nuclear plant, at prices which cannot now be accurately predicted. Unlike the electricity and natural gas markets, nuclear fuel markets have no sophisticated financial instruments available for price hedging, so most hedging is done through inventories and forward contracts, if they are available. With regard to the electric generating operations for UE, Genco and AERG that are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run CTs, the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs. We optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins. Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the advent of the MISO Day Two Energy Market. Marketing Company has acquired FTRs for its participation in the PJM Northern Illinois market. The FTRs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission congestion charges related to our physical electricity business. Depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid, FTRs could result in either charges or credits. We use complex grid modeling tools to determine which FTRs we wish to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is a risk that we may incorrectly model the amount of FTRs we will need, and there is the potential that the FTRs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges. With regard to UEs natural gas distribution business and CIPS, CILCOs and IPs power and natural gas distribution businesses, exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery mechanisms in place. These cost recovery mechanisms allow UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred costs. Our strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations for our regulated customers. We cannot eliminate the effects of price volatility. However, procurement strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier, as well as the management of physical assets. With regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for construction and maintenance activities, Ameren is exposed to changes in market prices for metal commodities and labor availability. See Supply for Electric Power under Part I, Item 1, of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric and oil. Also see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. Fair Value of Contracts Most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales. We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity and emission allowances. Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel, electricity and emission allowances may cause any of these conditions: an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted commitments to purchase or sell when 71 Table of Contents purchase or sales prices under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices; market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power that differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory under contracted commitment; or actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that differ from anticipated cash outlays. The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) changes in the fair value of all derivative contracts marked to market during the year ended December 31, 2007. The sources used to determine the fair value of these contracts were active quotes, other external sources, and other modeling and valuation methods.
