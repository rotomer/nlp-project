ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Ameren Executive Summary Operations In 2008 and early 2009, we were able to successfully execute on key aspects of our long term strategic plan. Our strategic plan calls for generation excellence and improvement of customer service and satisfaction. UEs Callaway nuclear plant completed its first ever breaker to breaker run and completed a plant record 28 day refueling and maintenance outage in the fall of 2008. In addition, the equivalent availability for UEs coal fired generating units was a solid 88% as compared to 89% in 2007. Amerens Non rate regulated Generation business segment set new generation records, producing approximately 31 million total megawatthours, as equivalent availability for its coal fired units was 85% compared to 81% in 2007. Amidst the economic challenges facing us and our nation, we have remained focused on our customers and have made significant investments in our energy infrastructure to improve overall reliability and customer satisfaction. In Missouri, through UEs Power On reliability program, we buried more than 100 miles of electric line, trimmed trees along more than 6,500 miles of overhead line, tested nearly 100,000 wood utility poles, and inspected more than 8,000 miles of electric line. In Illinois, we targeted the worst performing circuits and aggressively trimmed trees in Illinois Regulateds 40,000 square mile territory and continued to automate its transmission system to elevate its reliability. We believe that high quality customer service is essential to earning solid returns in our rate regulated businesses. In Missouri, UE received approval of an electric rate increase in January 2009 with new rates effective March 1, 2009. The authorized increase in annual electric revenues is approximately $162 million based on a 10.76% return on equity. The MoPSC rate order authorized a FAC, as well as a vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism. The FAC and tracking mechanisms improve UEs ability to continue to invest in its infrastructure so that UE will be able to meet its customers expectations for safe and reliable service. In Illinois, the ICC authorized in September 2008 new electric and gas rates for the Ameren Illinois Utilities effective October 1, 2008. These new rates provide approximately $161 million in additional annual revenue based on allowed returns on equity of nearly 10.7%. The ICC also approved an increase in the fixed non volumetric monthly charge for natural gas residential and commercial customers such that the Ameren Illinois Utilities now recover 80% of delivery service costs through this charge versus the prior 53%. The remainder is recovered through volume based charges. This will make our gas utility earnings less sensitive to volumetric swings. Earnings Ameren reported net income of $605 million, or $2.88 per share, for 2008 compared with net income of $618 million, or $2.98 per share, in 2007. The decline in earnings in 2008 versus 2007 was principally due to higher fuel and related transportation prices, increased spending on utility distribution system reliability, higher plant operations and maintenance costs, milder weather, and net unrealized mark to market losses on nonqualifying hedges, among other things. Those items more than offset the positive items. The positive items included improved generating plant output and higher realized margins from Non rate regulated Generation operations, the absence of costs in 2008 that were incurred in January 2007 associated with electric outages caused by severe ice storms and the amount of these costs that UE will recover as a result of an accounting order issued by the MoPSC, the reduced impact in 2008 of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, the absence in 2008 of the March 2007 FERC order that resettled costs among MISO market participants retroactive to 2005 that was recorded in 2007 and subsequent recovery of a portion of these costs in 2008 through a MoPSC order, net increases in electric and natural gas rates, and a 2008 lump sum settlement payment from a coal supplier for expected higher fuel costs in 2009 as a result of a premature mine closure and contract termination, among other things. Liquidity Cash flows from operations of $1.5 billion in 2008 at Ameren, along with other funds, were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of $534 million and to partially fund capital expenditures of $1.9 billion. The remaining capital expenditures were primarily funded with debt. We have taken actions to build on our financial strength and enhance our financial flexibility in light of the current difficult economic and capital and credit market conditions. These actions included the February 2009 decision of Amerens board of directors to reduce its common dividend and accessing the capital markets to increase our available liquidity, as well as making significant reductions in our 2008 and projected 2009 spending plans while still meeting our reliability, environmental, and safety objectives. Outlook The global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in 2008, and we expect those conditions to continue throughout 2009. We believe that the disruption in the capital and credit markets will further weaken global economic conditions. These weak economic conditions will likely result in volatility in the power and commodity markets, greater risk of defaults by our counterparties, weaker customer sales growth, particularly with respect to industrial sales, higher bad debt expense and possible impairment of goodwill and long lived assets, among other things. 29 Table of Contents Over the next few years, we continue to expect to make significant investments in our electric and natural gas infrastructure to improve reliability of our distribution systems and to comply with environmental requirements. From 2009 through 2011, we expect our rate regulated rate base to grow approximately 9% per year. Earnings growth in our rate regulated businesses is expected to come from updating existing customer rates to reflect these investments and the current levels of costs UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities are experiencing. We consider the 2008 and 2009 Illinois and Missouri rate orders to be constructive. However, the returns that UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities expect to earn in 2009 are below levels allowed by the respective state utility commissions in their last rate orders. The new rates were based on historic test year data and 2009 costs are expected to be higher than the levels recovered in rates. This is especially true of financing costs in Illinois, where sharply higher debt financing costs, which were incurred after our rate cases were filed, are not being recovered in rates. UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities will file more frequent rate cases requesting moderate rate increases, as well as continue to seek appropriate cost recovery and tracker mechanisms to mitigate regulatory lag. In addition, we will continue to optimize Amerens Non rate regulated Generations assets, focusing on improving the output of these plants and related energy marketing. We believe Non rate regulated Generations plants will be well positioned for earnings growth in the future should energy prices improve. We will incur significant costs in future years to comply with existing federal EPA and state regulations regarding SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants. Between 2009 and 2018, Ameren expects that certain Ameren Companies will be required to invest between $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion to retrofit their coal fired power plants with pollution control equipment. Any pollution control investments will result in decreased plant availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately 50% of this investment is expected to be in our Missouri Regulated operations, and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers. Future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global warming are subject to active consideration in the U.S. Congress. President Obama supports an economy wide cap and trade greenhouse gas reduction program that would reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. President Obama has also indicated support for auctioning 100% of the emission allowances to be distributed under the legislation. Although we cannot predict the date of enactment or the requirements of any global warming legislation or regulations, it is likely that some form of federal greenhouse gas legislation or regulations will become law during President Obamas administration. Potential impacts from proposed legislation could vary depending upon proposed CO2 emission limits, the timing of implementation of those limits, the method of allocating allowances, and provisions for cost containment measures. Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, which, in turn, could lead to increased liquidity needs and higher financing costs. Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force UE, Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI and other similarly situated electric power generators to close some coal fired facilities and could lead to possible impairment of assets. As a result, mandatory limits could have a material adverse impact on Amerens, UEs, Gencos, CILCOs (through AERG) and EEIs results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. General Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company under PUHCA administered by FERC. Amerens primary assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries. Amerens subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets and liabilities. These subsidiaries operate rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses, rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution businesses, and non rate regulated electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois, as discussed below. Dividends on Amerens common stock and the payment of other expenses by the Ameren and CILCORP holding companies are dependent on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed description of our principal subsidiaries. UE operates a rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution business, and a rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution business in Missouri. CIPS operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. Genco operates a non rate regulated electric generation business in Illinois and Missouri. CILCO, a subsidiary of CILCORP (a holding company), operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business and a non rate regulated electric generation business (through its subsidiary, AERG) in Illinois. IP operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are expressed in millions, unless otherwise indicated. In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, we present certain information in cents per share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect Amerens earnings. We believe this per share information helps readers to understand the impact of these factors on Amerens earnings per share. All references in this report to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares outstanding during the applicable year. 30 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Summary Our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations: winter heating and summer cooling demands. The vast majority of Amerens revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. This regulation has a material impact on the price we charge for our services. Non rate regulated Generation sales are also subject to market conditions for power. We principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil for fuel in our operations. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the global economic and political environment, weather, supply and demand, and many other factors. We do have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois and Missouri gas delivery businesses and purchased power cost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois electric delivery businesses. As part of the electric rate order issued by the MoPSC on January 27, 2009, UE was granted permission to put in place a FAC, which was effective March 1, 2009. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, for a discussion of the January 27, 2009, MoPSC order in UEs electric rate proceeding. Fluctuations in interest rates and conditions in the capital and credit markets affect our cost of borrowing and our pension and postretirement benefits costs. We employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risk and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of our power plants and transmission and distribution systems, the level of purchased power costs, operating and administrative costs, and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Amerens net income was $605 million ($2.88 per share) for 2008, $618 million ($2.98 per share) for 2007, and $547 million ($2.66 per share) for 2006. Amerens net income decreased $13 million and earnings per share decreased 10 cents in 2008 compared with 2007. Net income increased in the Non rate regulated Generation segment by $71 million in 2008 compared to 2007, while net income in the Missouri Regulated and Illinois Regulated segments decreased by $47 million and $15 million, respectively. Other net income decreased $22 million in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of net unrealized mark to market losses on nonqualifying hedges mainly related to fuel related transactions and reduced interest and dividend income. Compared with 2007 earnings, 2008 earnings were negatively affected by: higher fuel and related transportation prices, excluding net mark to market losses on fuel related transactions (27 cents per share); increased distribution system reliability expenditures (16 cents per share); higher plant operations and maintenance expenses (16 cents per share); unfavorable weather conditions (estimated at 16 cents per share); net unrealized mark to market losses on nonqualifying hedges (11 cents per share); higher financing costs (10 cents per share); asset impairment charges recorded during 2008 to adjust the carrying value of CILCOs (through AERG) Indian Trails and Sterling Avenue generation facilities to their estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008 (6 cents per share); increased depreciation and amortization expense (6 cents per share); the absence in 2008 of the reversal, recorded in 2007, of the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan accrual (5 cents per share); higher labor and employee benefit costs (5 cents per share); and higher bad debt expenses (3 cents per share). Compared with 2007 earnings, 2008 earnings were favorably affected by: higher realized electric margins in the Non rate regulated Generation segment; the absence of costs in 2008 that were incurred in January 2007 associated with electric outages caused by severe ice storms and the amount of these costs that UE will recover as a result of an accounting order issued by the MoPSC, which was recorded as a regulatory asset in 2008 (16 cents per share); the reduced impact in 2008 of the electric rate relief and customer assistance programs provided to certain Ameren Illinois Utilities electric customers under the Illinois electric settlement agreement (13 cents per share); the absence in 2008 of a March 2007 FERC order that resettled costs among MISO market participants retroactive to 2005 that was recorded in 2007 and the subsequent recovery of a portion of these costs in 2008, through a MoPSC order (10 cents per share); higher electric and natural gas delivery service rates in the Illinois Regulated segment pursuant to the ICC consolidated rate order for CIPS, CILCO, and IP issued in September 2008 (9 cents per share); a settlement agreement with a coal mine owner reached in June 2008 that reimbursed Genco, in the form of a lump sum payment, for increased costs for coal and transportation that it expects to incur in 2009 due to the premature closure of an Illinois mine at the end of 2007 (8 cents per share); higher electric rates, lower depreciation expense and decreased income tax expense in the Missouri Regulated segment pursuant to the MoPSC electric rate order for UE issued in May 2007 (8 cents per share); and the reduced impact of the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2008, as 31 Table of Contents compared with the prior year refueling and maintenance outage (4 cents per share). The cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2007. Amerens net income increased $71 million and earnings per share increased 32 cents in 2007 compared with 2006. Compared with 2006 earnings, 2007 earnings were favorably affected by: higher margins in the Non rate regulated Generation segment due to the replacement of below market power sales contracts, which expired in 2006, with higher priced contracts; higher electric rates, lower depreciation expense, decreased income tax expense and $5 million in SO2 emission allowance sales in the Missouri Regulated segment pursuant to the MoPSC electric rate order for UE issued in May 2007 (21 cents per share); decreased costs associated with outages caused by severe storms (17 cents per share); the absence of costs in 2007 that were incurred in 2006 related to the reservoir breach at UEs Taum Sauk plant (15 cents per share); and favorable weather conditions (estimated at 14 cents per share). Compared with 2006 earnings, 2007 earnings were negatively affected by: the combined effect of the elimination of the Ameren Illinois Utilities bundled electric tariffs, implementation of new delivery service tariffs effective January 2, 2007, and the expiration of below market power supply contracts; higher fuel and related transportation prices (31 cents per share); electric rate relief and customer assistance programs provided to certain Ameren Illinois Utilities electric customers under the Illinois electric settlement agreement (21 cents per share); higher labor and employee benefit costs (18 cents per share); higher financing costs (17 cents per share); lower emission allowance sales (16 cents per share); increases in distribution system reliability expenditures (15 cents per share); reduced gains on the sale of noncore properties, including leveraged leases (15 cents per share); increased depreciation and amortization expense (13 cents per share); a planned refueling and maintenance outage at UEs Callaway nuclear plant net of an unplanned outage at Callaway in 2006 (9 cents per share); and higher bad debt expenses (8 cents per share). The cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2006. Because it is a holding company, Amerens net income and cash flows are primarily generated by its principal subsidiaries: UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP and IP. The following table presents the contribution by Amerens principal subsidiaries to Amerens consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: 2008 2007 2006 Net income: UE(a) $ 245 $ 336 $ 343 CIPS 12 14 35 Genco 175 125 49 CILCORP 42 47 19 IP 3 24 55 Other(b) 128 72 46 Ameren net income $ 605 $ 618 $ 547 (a) Includes earnings from a non rate regulated 40% interest in EEI through February 29, 2008.

Electric margins are defined as electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. Gas margins are defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale. The table covers the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. We consider electric, interchange and gas margins useful measures to analyze the change in profitability of our electric and gas operations between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information we provide in accordance with GAAP. However, these margins may not be a presentation defined under GAAP, and they may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we provide elsewhere in this report. 2008 versus 2007 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO IP Electric revenue change: Effect of weather (estimate) $ (59 ) $ (36 ) $ (6 ) $ $ (4 ) $ (4 ) $ (13 ) Electric rate increases and market price changes 149 16 5 45 18 18 22 Interchange revenues, excluding estimated weather impact of $53 million (42 ) (47 ) Illinois settlement agreement, net of reimbursement 35 6 13 9 9 7 FERC ordered MISO resettlements (17 ) (12 ) (4 ) (4 ) Net mark to market gains on energy contracts 81 8 Illinois pass through power costs (72 ) (49 ) 22 22 (45 ) Generation output and other 9 29 (8 ) (14 ) 49 49 (4 ) Total electric revenue change $ 84 $ (30 ) $ (52 ) $ 32 $ 90 $ 90 $ (33 ) Fuel and purchased power change: Fuel: Generation and other $ 25 $ 31 $ $ 26 $ (32 ) $ (32 ) $ Emission allowance costs 8 5 1 Net mark to market losses on fuel contracts (75 ) (39 ) (18 ) (3 ) (3 ) Price (93 ) (56 ) (13 ) (15 ) (15 ) Coal contract settlement for 2009 27 27 Purchased power 58 9 9 23 8 7 3 Illinois pass through power costs 72 49 (22 ) (22 ) 45 FERC ordered MISO resettlements 47 23 8 4 4 12 Total fuel and purchased power change $ 69 $ (32 ) $ 66 $ 50 $ (59 ) $ (61 ) $ 60 Net change in electric margins $ 153 $ (62 ) $ 14 $ 82 $ 31 $ 29 $ 27 Net change in gas margins $ 36 $ 8 $ 7 $ $ (1 ) $ (1 ) $ 18 2007 versus 2006 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO IP Electric revenue change: Effect of weather (estimate) $ 73 $ 31 $ 16 $ $ 9 $ 9 $ 17 UE electric rate increase 29 29 Storm related outages (estimate) 10 9 3 (3 ) 1 JDA terminated December 31, 2006 (196 ) (97 ) Elimination of CILCO/AERG power supply agreement 108 108 108 Interchange revenues, excluding estimated weather impact of ($47) million 252 252 Illinois electric settlement agreement, net of reimbursement (73 ) (11 ) (30 ) (20 ) (20 ) (14 ) FERC ordered MISO resettlement March 2007 17 12 4 4 Mark to market losses on energy contracts (21 ) (13 ) Illinois rate redesign, generation repricing, growth and other (estimate) 288 11 36 2 167 167 (49 ) Total electric revenue change $ 683 $ 123 $ 44 $ (116 ) $ 268 $ 268 $ (45 ) 34 Table of Contents 2007 versus 2006 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCORP CILCO IP Fuel and purchased power change: Fuel: Generation and other $ (35 ) $ (10 ) $ $ (50 ) $ 15 $ 14 $ Emission allowances sales (costs) (38 ) (29 ) 14 11 Mark to market gains (losses) on fuel contracts 23 9 6 1 1 Price (98 ) (84 ) (5 ) (5 ) (5 ) JDA terminated December 31, 2006 97 196 Purchased power (82 ) (5 ) (48 ) 103 (113 ) (112 ) 35 Entergy Arkansas, Inc. power purchase agreement (12 ) (12 ) Elimination of CILCO/AERG power supply agreement (108 ) (108 ) (108 ) FERC ordered MISO resettlement March 2007 (35 ) (11 ) (8 ) (4 ) (4 ) (12 ) Storm related energy costs (estimate) (1 ) (2 ) 1 1 Total fuel and purchased power change $ (386 ) $ (47 ) $ (56 ) $ 251 $ (200 ) $ (203 ) $ 24 Net change in electric margins $ 297 $ 76 $ (12 ) $ 135 $ 68 $ 65 $ (21 ) Net change in gas margins $ 15 $ 10 $ 2 $ $ 5 $ 5 $ 1 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Amerens electric margin increased by $153 million, or 4%, in 2008 compared with 2007. The following items had a favorable impact on Amerens electric margin: Net mark to market gains on energy transactions of $81 million, primarily related to nonqualifying hedges of changes in market prices for electricity. Improved Non rate regulated Generation plant availability due to the lack of an extended plant outage in 2008. Non rate regulated Generations baseload coal fired generating plants average capacity and equivalent availability factors were approximately 76% and 85%, respectively, in 2008 compared with 74% and 81%, respectively, in 2007. The effect of rate increases. The Ameren Illinois Utilities net electric rate increase, effective October 1, 2008, increased electric margin by $27 million. UEs electric rate increase, effective June 4, 2007, increased electric margin by $16 million. The reduced impact of the Illinois electric settlement agreement increased electric margin by $35 million. The absence in 2008 of a March 2007 FERC order that resettled costs among MISO participants retroactive to 2005 that was recorded in 2007 and the subsequent recovery of a portion of these costs in 2008 through a MoPSC order. The net benefit to electric margin in 2008 of these items was $30 million. A settlement agreement with a coal mine owner reached in June 2008, which reimbursed Genco, in the form of a lump sum payment, for increased costs for coal and transportation that it expects to incur in 2009 due to the premature closure of an Illinois mine at the end of 2007, increased electric margin by $27 million. Other MISO net purchased power costs decreased by $23 million. Lower Non rate regulated Generation emission allowance costs of $8 million. Increased Non rate regulated Generation capacity sales of $6 million. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Amerens electric margin for 2008 as compared with 2007: Net mark to market losses on fuel related transactions of $75 million, primarily related to financial instruments that were acquired to mitigate the risk of rising diesel fuel price adjustments embedded in coal transportation contracts for the period 2008 through 2012. Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 30% reduction in cooling degree days, which decreased electric margin by an estimated $65 million. Compared to normal weather, cooling degree days in 2008 were 5% lower. Fuel prices increased by 6%. Lower interchange margin due to reduced UE plant availability, partially offset by an 8% increase in realized prices and a 10% increase in hydroelectric generation. Nuclear plant availability was unfavorably affected by unplanned plant outages, which offset the shorter planned refueling and maintenance outage. UEs coal fired generating plants average capacity and equivalent availability factors were approximately 78% and 88%, respectively, in 2008 compared with 80% and 89%, respectively, in 2007. Amerens gas margin increased by $36 million, or 9%, in 2008 compared with 2007. The following items had a favorable impact on Amerens gas margin: Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 13% increase in heating degree days, which increased gas margin by an estimated $12 million. Compared to normal weather, heating degree days in 2008 were 7% higher. The effect of rate increases. The Ameren Illinois Utilities net gas rate increase, effective October 1, 2008, increased gas margin by $4 million. The UE gas rate increase, effective April 2007, increased gas margin by $3 million. 35 Table of Contents A September 2008 ICC rate order that concluded that a portion of previously expensed nonrecoverable purchased gas costs should be capitalized, which increased gas margin by $9 million. A 2% increase in weather normalized sales volumes and favorable customer sales mix, which increased gas margin by $5 million. Increased transportation revenues of $4 million. Missouri Regulated UE UEs electric margin decreased $62 million, or 3%, in 2008 compared with 2007. The following items had an unfavorable impact on UEs electric margin: Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 29% reduction in cooling degree days, which decreased electric margin by an estimated $42 million. Net mark to market losses on fuel related transactions of $39 million, primarily related to financial instruments that were acquired to mitigate the risk of rising diesel fuel price adjustments embedded in coal transportation contracts for the period 2008 through 2012. Fuel prices increased by 5%. Lower replacement power insurance recoveries of $12 million due to the lack of an extended plant outage and an increase in insurance recovery deductible limits. Lower interchange margin due to reduced plant availability, partially offset by an 8% increase in realized prices and a 10% increase in hydroelectric generation. Nuclear plant availability was unfavorably affected by unplanned plant outages, which offset the shorter planned refueling and maintenance outage. UEs coal fired generating plants average capacity and equivalent availability factors were approximately 78% and 88%, respectively, in 2008, compared with 80% and 89%, respectively in 2007. The following items that had a favorable impact on electric margin in 2008 as compared with 2007: The absence in 2008 of a March 2007 FERC order that resettled costs among MISO participants retroactive to 2005 that was recorded in 2007 and the subsequent recovery of a portion of these costs in 2008 through a MoPSC order.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $170 million in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of higher distribution system reliability expenditures of $30 million, increased plant maintenance expenditures at coal fired plants of $43 million due to outages, higher labor costs of $52 million, increased information technology costs of $10 million, and unrealized net mark to market adjustments of $22 million resulting from the lower market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans. Bad debt expense also increased $10 million, primarily because of the continued transition to higher market based rates at the Ameren Illinois Utilities. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2007, a $15 million accrual established in 2006 for contributions to assist customers through the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan was reversed because the plan was terminated, with no similar item in 2008. In addition, other operations and maintenance expenses increased in 2008 by $14 million because of asset impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 to adjust the carrying value of CILCOs (through AERG) Indian Trails and Sterling Avenue generation facilities to their estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008. CILCO recorded an asset impairment charge of $12 million related to the Indian Trails cogeneration facility as a result of the suspension of operations by the facilitys only customer. CILCORP recorded a $2 million impairment charge related to the Sterling Avenue CT based on the expected net proceeds to be generated from the sale of the facility in 2009. Because most of the Sterling Avenue asset carrying value is recorded at CILCORP, as a result of adjustments made during purchase accounting, the write down of the carrying value of the Sterling Avenue CT did not result in an impairment loss at CILCO (AERG). Reducing the unfavorable effect of these items were lower employee benefit costs of $10 million due to changes 41 Table of Contents in actuarial estimates and reduced storm expenditures of $18 million, primarily in UEs service territory, in 2008 compared with 2007. Additionally, costs associated with the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2008 were $5 million lower than those for the refueling in 2007. Other operations and maintenance expenses were further reduced in the current year by a MoPSC accounting order received in the second quarter of 2008, which resulted in UE recording a regulatory asset for $25 million of costs related to 2007 storms that had previously been expensed. Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses in Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE UEs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $22 million in 2008, as compared with 2007, primarily because of increased distribution system reliability expenditures of $16 million, higher labor costs of $37 million, increased plant maintenance expenditures at coal fired plants of $29 million, and unrealized net mark to market adjustments resulting from the lower market value of investments used to support deferred compensation plans. Reducing the impact of these items was the effect of the MoPSC accounting order discussed above, a decrease in injuries and damages expenses between years, and the reduced impact of the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage in 2008 compared with the refueling in 2007. Storm repair expenditures also decreased by $31 million in 2008 compared with 2007, further reducing other operations and maintenance expenses. Illinois Regulated Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $77 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2008, compared with 2007. CIPS Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $24 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The increase was primarily because of higher distribution system reliability expenditures of $11 million, including storm costs, along with increased labor costs and bad debt expense. Additionally, the reversal in the first quarter of 2007 of an accrual of $4 million, established in 2006, for contributions to assist customers through the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan, with no similar item in 2008, resulted in higher other operations and maintenance expenses in 2008 compared with 2007. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $8 million in 2008, as compared with 2007, primarily because of increased storm costs of $5 million in 2008. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2007, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) reversed a $3 million accrual established in 2006 for the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan contributions, with no similar item in 2008. Lower employee benefit costs reduced the effect of these unfavorable items. IP Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $47 million in 2008, as compared with 2007, primarily because of higher distribution system reliability expenditures of $17 million, including storm costs. Labor costs and bad debt expense increased by $6 million each, and unrealized net mark to market adjustments resulting from the lower market value of investments used to support deferred compensation plans also increased other operations and maintenance expenses between years. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2007, IP reversed an $8 million accrual established in 2006 for the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan contributions, with no similar item in 2008. Reducing the unfavorable effect of these items was a reduction in employee benefit costs.

CILCO (AERG) Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $25 million at CILCO (AERG) in 2008, as compared with 2007, primarily because of a $12 million impairment charge recorded in 2008 related to the Indian Trails cogeneration plant as discussed above, higher plant maintenance costs of $7 million due to scheduled outages, and increased labor costs of $3 million. CILCO (AERG) paid $1.5 million to the IPA in 2007 as part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, with no similar item in 2008, reducing other operations and maintenance expenses between 2008 and 2007. CILCORP (parent company only) Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $3 million in 2008, as compared with 2007, primarily because of an asset impairment charge recorded in 2008 related to the Sterling Avenue CT discussed above. 42 Table of Contents EEI Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable in 2008 and 2007. 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $131 million in 2007 compared with 2006. Maintenance and labor costs associated with the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in the second quarter of 2007 added $35 million. Distribution system reliability expenditures increased $49 million and employee benefits and non Callaway labor costs were higher by $55 million in 2007 compared with 2006. Bad debt expenses increased $25 million in 2007, primarily as a result of the transition to higher electric rates in Illinois. Increases in maintenance at coal fired power plants and injuries and damages reserves also contributed to higher other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007. We recognized reduced gains on sales of noncore property in 2007 of $4 million, compared with gains of $16 million in 2006. Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 included a payment of $4.5 million made to the IPA as part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Reducing the effect of these items was the reversal in 2007 of an accrual of $15 million established in 2006 for contributions to assist customers through the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan. In 2006, we also recognized costs of $25 million related to the December 2005 Taum Sauk plant reservoir breach. Costs associated with storms in the spring and summer of 2006 and a major ice storm in the fourth quarter of 2006 exceeded the costs associated with an ice storm in January 2007 by $42 million, thereby reducing other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 compared with 2006. Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Other operations and maintenance expenses increased in 2007 compared with 2006. Maintenance and labor costs associated with the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2007 added $35 million to other operations and maintenance expenses compared with 2006. Higher distribution system reliability expenditures of $34 million, increased non Callaway related labor costs of $22 million, and insurance premiums of $19 million for replacement power coverage paid to a risk insurance affiliate also increased other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 compared with 2006. Reducing the effect of these items was the absence in 2007 of costs recorded in 2006 related to the Taum Sauk plant reservoir breach discussed above. Costs associated with storms in the spring and summer of 2006 and a major ice storm in the fourth quarter of 2006 exceeded the costs associated with an ice storm in January 2007 by $13 million, thereby reducing other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007 compared with 2006. Illinois Regulated Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $15 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2007 compared with 2006. CIPS Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $11 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of increased bad debt expenses, higher distribution system reliability expenditures, and increased injuries and damages reserves. The reversal in 2007 of the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan accrual of $4 million established in 2006 reduced the effect of these increases. Costs associated with storms in the spring and summer of 2006 and a major ice storm in the fourth quarter of 2006 were comparable with the costs associated with an ice storm in January 2007. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006, as an increase in bad debt expenses was offset by the reversal of the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan accrual of $3 million established in 2006. Costs associated with storms had a minimal impact on CILCO (Illinois Regulated) other operations and maintenance expenses each year. IP IPs other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006. Higher employee benefit costs increased other operations and maintenance expenses in 2007. Bad debt expenses increased $10 million in 2007, primarily as a result of the transition to higher electric rates in Illinois. Offsetting the effect of these items was the reversal in 2007 of the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan accrual of $8 million established in 2006 and a reduction of $24 million in storm repair costs between years. Non rate regulated Generation Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $30 million in the Non rate regulated Generation segment in 2007 compared with 2006. Genco Gencos other operations and maintenance expenses increased $10 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of higher labor costs, the IPA payment of $3 million, and insurance premiums for replacement power coverage paid to a risk insurance affiliate. 43 Table of Contents CILCORP (parent company only) Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006. Increased employee benefit costs in 2007 were offset by the absence in 2007 of a write off in 2006, of an intangible asset established in conjunction with Amerens acquisition of CILCORP. CILCO (AERG) Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $11 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of higher power plant maintenance costs due to plant outages and the IPA payment of $1.5 million. EEI Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of higher power plant maintenance costs. Depreciation and Amortization 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between periods. Increases in depreciation expense resulting from capital additions during the past year were mitigated by a reduction in expense because of changes in the useful lives of plant assets resulting from rate orders in 2007 in Missouri and 2008 in Illinois, as discussed below. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses in Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $4 million in 2008, compared with 2007, primarily because of the extension of UEs nuclear and coal fired plants useful lives for purposes of calculating depreciation expense in conjunction with a MoPSC electric rate order effective June 2007. Reducing the benefit of this item was an increase in capital additions over the past year. Illinois Regulated Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in 2008 and 2007 in the Illinois Regulated segment. As part of the consolidated electric and natural gas rate order issued by the ICC in September 2008, the ICC changed plant asset useful lives, effective October 1, 2008, which resulted in an increase in depreciation expense at IP and reductions in depreciation expense at CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated). The effects of these changes in useful lives were partially offset by capital additions at CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated). IPs depreciation and amortization expenses increased due to the effect of the rate order and capital additions. Non rate regulated Generation Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $4 million in the Non rate regulated Generation segment in 2008 compared with 2007. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $8 million at CILCO (AERG) because of capital additions over the past year. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $4 million at Genco, primarily as a result of a depreciation study completed in September 2007, which was mitigated by capital additions. 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased $20 million in 2007 over 2006. The increases were primarily because of amortization of a regulatory asset in 2007 at IP, as discussed below, and capital additions in 2006 and 2007. A decrease in depreciation expense as a result of the MoPSC electric rate order effective in June 2007, discussed above, somewhat mitigated that effect. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2007 were comparable with 2006. Increased expenses associated with capital additions in 2006 and 2007 were offset by a reduction in depreciation as a result of the MoPSC electric rate order, effective June 2007, discussed above. Illinois Regulated Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $25 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2007 compared with 2006. CIPS & CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006. IP Depreciation and amortization expenses, including amortization of regulatory assets on IPs statement of income, increased $19 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of the start of amortization in 2007 of a regulatory asset associated with acquisition integration costs, as required by an ICC order, and capital additions. Non rate regulated Generation Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment and for Genco, CILCORP (parent company only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI. 44 Table of Contents Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Amerens taxes other than income taxes increased $12 million in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of higher property taxes and higher gross receipts taxes. Increases in property taxes were reduced by invested capital electricity distribution tax credits in the Illinois Regulated segment. These credits were related to payments made in a previous year. Variations in taxes other than income taxes in Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE UEs taxes other than income taxes increased $6 million in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of higher property taxes. Illinois Regulated Taxes other than income taxes increased $5 million in 2008 compared with 2007 in the Illinois Regulated segment, primarily because of higher excise taxes at CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and IP. Property taxes were comparable between years as increases in 2008 were mitigated by the favorable impact of the invested capital electricity distribution tax credits discussed above. Non rate regulated Generation Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between 2008 and 2007 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment and for Genco, CILCORP (parent company only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI. 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Amerens taxes other than income taxes decreased $10 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of lower gross receipts and property taxes. Variations in taxes other than income taxes for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Taxes other than income taxes increased $4 million in 2007 over 2006, primarily because of increased gross receipts taxes. Illinois Regulated Taxes other than income taxes decreased $16 million in 2007 compared with 2006 in the Illinois Regulated segment. Taxes other than income taxes decreased $7 million at CIPS, $2 million at CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and $7 million at IP in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily as a result of reduced property taxes and excise taxes. Non rate regulated Generation Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between 2007 and 2006 for the Non rate regulated Generation segment and for Genco, CILCORP (parent company only), CILCO (AERG), and EEI. Other Income and Expenses 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Miscellaneous income increased $5 million in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of an increase at UE in allowance for funds used during construction, reduced by lower interest income. Miscellaneous expense increased $6 million in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of increased expenses associated with contributions to social programs. Variations in other income and expenses in Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Miscellaneous income increased $24 million in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of an increase in allowance for funds used during construction. The increase in allowance for funds used during construction resulted from higher rates and increased construction in progress balances. Miscellaneous expenses were comparable in 2008 and 2007. Illinois Regulated Other income and expenses decreased $9 million in 2008 in the Illinois Regulated segment and at CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP, compared with 2007, primarily because of lower interest income. Non rate regulated Generation Other income and expenses in the Non rate regulated Generation segment and at Genco, CILCORP (parent company only), CILCO (AERG) and EEI were comparable between 2008 and 2007. 45 Table of Contents 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Miscellaneous income increased $25 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of increased interest and investment income. Cash balances were higher because of uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of legislative and regulatory issues in Illinois. Miscellaneous expense increased $6 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because we made contributions to our charitable trust and because Illinois Regulated made contributions of $5 million for energy efficiency and customer assistance programs as part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Variations in other income and expenses for the Ameren, CILCORP and CILCO business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Other income and expenses were comparable in 2007 and 2006. Illinois Regulated Other income and expenses increased $7 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of increased interest income at IP. Other income and expenses were comparable between years at CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated). Non rate regulated Generation Other income and expenses were comparable between 2007 and 2006 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment and for Genco, CILCORP (parent company only), CILCO (AERG), and EEI. Interest 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Interest expense increased $17 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Long term debt issuances, net of maturities and redemptions, and the cost of refinancing auction rate environmental improvement and pollution control revenue refunding bonds resulted in increased interest expense in 2008. See Insured Auction Rate Tax exempt Bonds under Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report for additional information. These increases were reduced as a result of income tax settlements in 2008. Variations in interest expense in Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Interest expense was comparable in 2008 and 2007. Interest expense associated with the issuance of senior secured notes of $450 million, $250 million, and $425 million in June 2008, April 2008 and June 2007, respectively, was mitigated by a reduction in short term borrowings due to the long term debt financings. Senior secured notes were issued to refinance auction rate environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds, to fund the maturity of $148 million of first mortgage bonds, and to reduce short term borrowings. Additionally, interest expense was reduced by $8 million resulting from the income tax settlements noted above. Illinois Regulated Interest expense increased $12 million in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2008 compared with 2007. CIPS Interest expense decreased $7 million in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of reduced short term borrowings. Additionally, interest expense was reduced by $3 million as a result of an income tax settlement. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Interest expense was comparable in 2008 and 2007. IP Interest expense increased $22 million in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of the issuance of $400 million, $337 million, and $250 million of senior secured notes at IP in October 2008, April 2008, and November 2007, respectively. The $337 million senior secured notes were issued to refinance auction rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds, while the other debt issuances were used to reduce short term borrowings. Non rate regulated Generation Interest expense decreased $8 million in the Non rate regulated Generation segment in 2008 compared with 2007. Genco Interest expense was comparable in 2008 and 2007. Increased interest expense resulting from the issuance of $300 million of senior unsecured notes in April 2008 was mitigated by a resulting reduction in short term borrowings. Additionally, interest expense was reduced by $3 million as a result of an income tax settlement. 46 Table of Contents CILCORP (parent company only) and CILCO (AERG) Interest expense decreased $3 million at CILCORP (parent company only) and $4 million at CILCO (AERG), in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of reduced short term borrowings. EEI Interest expense was comparable in 2008 and 2007. 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Interest expense increased $73 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of increased short term borrowings, higher interest rates due to reduced credit ratings, and other items noted below. With the adoption of FIN 48 in 2007, we also began to record interest associated with uncertain tax positions as interest expense rather than income tax expense. These interest charges were $10 million for 2007. Reducing the effect of the above unfavorable items were maturities of $350 million of long term debt in the first half of 2007 at Ameren and redemptions/maturities at the Ameren Companies as noted below. Variations in interest expense for Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE Interest expense increased $23 million in 2007 over 2006, primarily because of increased short term borrowings, higher interest rates due to reduced credit ratings, and the issuance of $425 million of senior secured notes in June 2007. Interest expense recorded in conjunction with uncertain tax positions was $3 million in 2007. Illinois Regulated Interest expense increased $37 million in the Illinois Regulated segment and increased at CIPS and IP in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of increased short term borrowings and higher interest rates due to reduced credit ratings and the issuance of senior secured notes in 2007 and 2006. IP issued $250 million and $75 million of senior secured notes in November 2007 and June 2006, respectively. CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated) issued $61 million and $96 million of senior secured notes, respectively, in June 2006. Reducing the effect of the above items was the maturity of $50 million of first mortgage bonds at CILCO (Illinois Regulated) in January 2007 and payments made on IPs note payable to IP SPT in 2007 and 2006. Non rate regulated Generation Interest expense increased $4 million in the Non rate regulated Generation segment in 2007 compared with 2006. CILCORP (parent company only) and CILCO (AERG) Interest expense increased $3 million at CILCORP (parent company only) and $5 million at CILCO (AERG) in 2007 over 2006, primarily because of increased short term borrowings and higher interest rates due to reduced credit ratings. Genco Interest expense decreased $5 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of reduced intercompany borrowings. Reducing this benefit was increased interest expense of $3 million recorded in conjunction with uncertain tax positions in 2007. EEI Interest expense was comparable in 2007 and 2006. Income Taxes 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Amerens effective tax rate was comparable in 2008 and 2007. Favorable impacts of state audit settlements and changes in state apportionment were offset by unfavorable permanent items related to company owned life insurance as well as other variations discussed below at the Ameren Companies. Variations in effective tax rates for Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE The effective tax rate increased in 2008 from 2007, primarily because of lower favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities, along with decreased Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions in 2008. Illinois Regulated The effective tax rate decreased in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2008 compared with 2007, because of the items detailed below. CIPS The effective tax rate decreased in 2008 from 2007, primarily because of the impact of net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities and permanent items on lower pretax income in 2008. 47 Table of Contents CILCO (Illinois Regulated) The effective tax rate for 2008 was higher than the effective tax rate for 2007, primarily because of lower tax credits, lower favorable net amortization of property related regulatory asset and liabilities, and lower favorable permanent benefits related to company owned life insurance. IP The effective tax rate for 2008 was higher than the effective tax rate for 2007, primarily because of lower favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities, lower tax credits, and the impact of other permanent items as well as increased reserves for uncertain tax positions on lower pretax book income in 2008. Non rate regulated Generation The effective tax rate decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 in the Non rate regulated Generation segment, because of the items detailed below. Genco The effective tax rate decreased in 2008 from 2007, primarily because of the increased impact of Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions and research tax credits. CILCO (AERG) The effective tax rate increased in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of the impact of Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions. CILCORP (parent company only) The effective tax rate increased in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of the effect of state audit settlements. EEI The effective tax rate was comparable in 2008 and 2007. 2007 versus 2006 Ameren Amerens effective tax rate increased between 2007 and 2006. Variations in effective tax rates for Amerens, CILCORPs and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Missouri Regulated UE The effective tax rate decreased in 2007 from 2006, primarily because of the implementation of changes ordered by the MoPSC in UEs 2007 electric rate order. These changes decreased the unfavorable effect of the net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to 2006, decreased reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2007 compared to increases in 2006, and increased Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions in 2007 compared with 2006. Illinois Regulated The effective tax rate decreased in the Illinois Regulated segment in 2007 compared with 2006, because of the items detailed below. CIPS The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of higher reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2007 compared to 2006, the unfavorable effect of the net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2006, lower permanent benefit for SFAS No. 106 2, as it relates to Medicare Part D provisions, and other miscellaneous items, offset by the increased impact of the amortization of investment tax credit, and other items on lower pretax book income. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of an increase in the permanent benefit for SFAS No. 106 2, as it relates to Medicare Part D provisions, along with an increase in the favorable effect of the net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities, and increased impact of the amortization of investment tax credit on lower pretax book income. IP The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of the favorable effect of the net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to unfavorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2006. Non rate regulated Generation The effective tax rate increased in the Non rate regulated Generation segment in 2007 compared with 2006, because of the items detailed below. Genco The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of lower decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 48 Table of Contents 2007 compared to 2006, and decreased Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions in 2007 compared to 2006. CILCO (AERG) The effective tax rate increased in 2007, primarily because of higher reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2007 compared to 2006 and decreased impact of amortization of investment tax credit on higher pretax book income, offset by increased Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions in 2007 compared to 2006, and differences between the book and tax treatment of the sales of noncore properties in 2006. CILCORP (parent company only) The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of a change in the permanent benefit for SFAS No. 106 2, as it relates to Medicare Part D provisions. EEI The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of increased Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The tariff based gross margins of Amerens rate regulated utility operating companies (UE, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP) continue to be a principal source of cash from operating activities for Ameren and its rate regulated subsidiaries. A diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate regulated residential, commercial and industrial classes and a commodity mix of gas and electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows for Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP. For operating cash flows, Genco and AERG rely on power sales to Marketing Company, which sold power through the September 2006 Illinois power procurement auction, financial contracts that were part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, and the 2008 Illinois RFP process for energy and capacity that was used pursuant to the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Marketing Company is also selling power through other primarily market based contracts with wholesale and retail customers. In addition to cash flows from operating activities, the Ameren Companies use available cash, credit facilities, money pool or other short term borrowings from affiliates to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements. The use of operating cash flows and short term borrowings to fund capital expenditures and other investments may periodically result in a working capital deficit as was the case at December 31, 2008, for Ameren, UE, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP. The Ameren Companies may reduce their short term borrowings with cash from operations or discretionarily with long term borrowings, or in the case of Ameren subsidiaries, with equity infusions from Ameren. The Ameren Companies expect to incur significant capital expenditures over the next five years as they comply with environmental regulations and make significant investments in their electric and gas utility infrastructure to improve overall system reliability. Ameren intends to finance those capital expenditures and investments with a blend of equity and debt so that it maintains a capital structure in its rate regulated businesses, containing approximately 50% to 55% equity. Consequently, we expect to make equity issuances in the future consistent with this objective, as well as to address any unanticipated events, should the need arise. We plan to implement our long term financing plans for debt, equity or equity linked securities in order to appropriately finance our operations, meet scheduled debt maturities and maintain financial strength and flexibility. The global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in 2008, and continue to experience volatility and disruption in 2009. See Outlook for a discussion of the implications of this volatility and disruption for the Ameren Companies and our plans to address these issues. The following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities Net Cash (Used In) Investing Activities Net Cash Provided By (Used In)Financing Activities 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Ameren(a) $ 1,533 $ 1,102 $ 1,279 $ (2,097 ) $ (1,468 ) $ (1,266 ) $ 301 $ 584 $ 28 UE 545 588 734 (1,033 ) (700 ) (732 ) 303 296 (21 ) CIPS 103 14 118 (57 ) (42 ) (66 ) (72 ) 48 (46 ) Genco 244 255 138 (328 ) (210 ) (110 ) 84 (44 ) (27 ) CILCORP 184 32 133 (318 ) (213 ) (90 ) 128 183 (42 ) CILCO 209 74 153 (317 ) (212 ) (161 ) 102 141 9 IP 180 28 172 (233 ) (180 ) (180 ) 97 158 8 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. 49 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities 2008 versus 2007 Amerens cash from operating activities increased in 2008, compared to 2007, primarily because of higher electric and gas margins as discussed above, a $177 million decrease in income tax payments (net of refunds), and improved collections of receivables in 2008. The reduction in income tax payments was largely attributable to higher depreciation allowed for tax purposes. In 2007, receivables from the Ameren Illinois Utilities had increased due to the January 2, 2007, electric rate increases, related uncertainty surrounding a potential electric settlement agreement, and deterioration of collections. However, collections improved in 2008. Additionally, Ameren experienced an $87 million benefit to cash flows for 2008 as compared to 2007 because of the timing of cash receipts for MISO receivables. The Illinois electric settlement agreement also had a positive effect on cash from operations in 2008 compared with 2007. Cash outflows in accordance with the settlement, net of reimbursements from generators, were $84 million less in 2008 than in 2007. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. In addition, Amerens cash flows from operations increased in 2008 compared with 2007 because of a $40 million reduction in storm restoration costs, over recovery under the PGAs, and a $27 million payment received by Genco in 2008 as part of a coal contract settlement for increased costs for coal and transportation that Genco expects to incur in 2009 due to the premature closure of an Illinois mine at the end of 2007. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, for information on the coal contract settlement. Factors that offset, in part, the favorable variance in cash flows from operations in 2008 were a $93 million increase in cash payments related to the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident, net of insurance companies, an increase in gas inventories resulting from price increases, higher interest payments, and higher levels of collateral posted with suppliers. At UE, cash from operating activities decreased in 2008, compared to 2007. The decrease is primarily due to a $24 million increase in net income tax payments in 2008, lower electric margins, increased system reliability expenditures as discussed in Results of Operations, and higher levels of net collateral posted with suppliers. Also contributing to the unfavorable variance in 2008 was a $93 million increase in cash payments related to the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident, net of insurance recoveries, and a $146 million net decrease in affiliate payables. Factors increasing cash from operations included a $34 million decrease in payments for storm restorations, a decrease in other operations and maintenance expenditures related to the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2008 as compared with the 2007 refueling and maintenance outage, reduction in interest payments, and the collection in 2008 of an $85 million affiliate receivable. In addition, cash flows from operations increased in 2008 compared with 2007 because of the timing of cash receipts for MISO receivables. At CIPS, cash from operating activities increased in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to net income tax refunds of $21 million in 2008, compared with net income tax payments of $44 million in 2007, an increase in gas cost over recovery from customers under the PGA, a $7 million increase in customer advances for construction, and favorable fluctuations in receivables and payables. In 2007, receivables increased due to the January 2, 2007, electric rate increases, related uncertainty surrounding a potential settlement agreement, and deterioration of collections. However, collections improved in 2008. The Illinois electric settlement agreement also had a positive effect on cash from operations in 2008 compared to 2007. CIPS cash outflows from the settlement, net of reimbursements from generators, were $26 million less in 2008 than in 2007. CIPS experienced favorable fluctuations in intercompany receivable and payable balances resulting from changes in its year end 2008 income tax position and a receivable related to the Illinois electric settlement agreement compared with 2007. Partially offsetting the favorable variance in cash flow from operations was a larger increase in gas inventories during 2008 compared with 2007, a decrease in electric costs over recovered from customers, and higher net levels of collateral posted with suppliers. Gencos cash from operating activities decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in fuel inventory and an increase in net income tax payments of $13 million. Reducing the unfavorable variance in cash flow from operations were higher electric margins, a payment from an Illinois coal mine owner for the premature closure of an Illinois mine, as discussed above, and a $6 million reduction in funding required by the Illinois electric settlement agreement in 2008 compared with 2007. Cash from operating activities increased for CILCORP and CILCO in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to net income tax refunds of $33 million and $15 million in 2008 compared with net income tax payments of $16 million and $35 million in 2007 at CILCORP and CILCO, respectively, higher electric margins, a reduction of coal inventory at AERG, an increase in gas cost recovered from customers under a PGA, an increase in electric cost over recovered from customers, and favorable fluctuations in receivables and payables. In 2007, receivables increased due to the January 2, 2007 electric rate increases, related uncertainty surrounding a potential settlement agreement, and deterioration of collections. However, collections improved in 2008. The Illinois electric settlement agreement also had a positive effect on cash from operations in 2008 compared with 2007. The cash outflows from the settlement, including AERGs obligation, were $16 million lower in 2008 than in 2007. CILCORP experienced favorable fluctuations in intercompany receivable and payable balances resulting from changes in its year end 2008 income tax position and a receivable related to the Illinois electric settlement agreement 50 Table of Contents compared with 2007. Partially offsetting these increases in cash from operations were a larger increase in gas inventories during 2008 compared with 2007, as both price and volumes increased, and higher levels of collateral, net, posted with suppliers. Additionally, CILCORPs operating cash flows in 2008 were reduced by $22 million compared with 2007 due to higher interest payments. IPs cash from operating activities increased in 2008, compared with 2007. The increase was primarily due to net income tax refunds of $43 million in 2008, compared with net income tax payments of $18 million in 2007, increased electric and gas margins, an increase in gas cost recovered from customers under a PGA, an increase in electric power costs over recovered from customers, a $7 million increase in customer advances for construction, and favorable fluctuations in receivables and payables. In 2007, receivables increased due to the January 2, 2007, electric rate increases, related uncertainty surrounding a potential settlement agreement, and deterioration of collections. However, collections improved in 2008. The Illinois electric settlement agreement also had a positive effect on cash from operations in 2008 compared to 2007. IP cash outflows from the settlement, net of reimbursements from generators, were $35 million lower in 2008 than in 2007. IP experienced favorable fluctuations in intercompany receivable and payable balances resulting from changes in its year end 2008 income tax position and a receivable related to the Illinois electric settlement agreement compared with 2007. In addition, operating cash required for major repairs in response to 2008 storms was $8 million less than major storm repairs in 2007. Partially offsetting these increases to operating cash flows was a $10 million increase in interest payments and higher net levels of collateral posted with suppliers in 2008. 2007 versus 2006 Amerens cash from operating activities decreased in 2007, as compared with 2006. This was primarily because of an increase in working capital investment as the collection of higher electric rates from Illinois electric customers lagged payments for power purchases, and past due accounts increased because of the higher rates. The Illinois electric settlement agreement resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of $88 million: $211 million of customer refunds, credits, and program funding, minus related reimbursements from nonaffiliated Illinois generators of $123 million. An additional payment of $4.5 million was made to fund the IPA. As of the end of 2007, $34 million was due from nonaffiliated generators. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Other factors also reduced cash flow: increased interest payments as a result of lower credit ratings and increased debt. In addition, cash spent for fuel inventory increased because UE increased its inventory, and AERG experienced increased inventory as a result of an extended plant outage. Also reducing operating cash flows was a $25 million increase in pension and postretirement benefit contributions. In 2007, a $120 million decrease in income taxes paid (net of refunds) benefited cash flows from operations in 2007. Increases in electric and gas margins of $296 million and $15 million, respectively, also benefited operating cash flows, but were reduced by higher operations and maintenance expenses, as discussed in Results of Operations. At UE, cash from operating activities decreased in 2007, compared with 2006, primarily because of an increase in accounts receivable caused by higher prices for interchange power sales, colder weather in December 2007 than in December 2006, and increased electric rates. Further reducing cash flows in 2007, was an increase in interest payments and other operations and maintenance expenditures, including $35 million for the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage. In addition, UE increased its fuel inventory. Compared with 2006, cash flows from operations in 2007 benefited from an increase in margin, as discussed in Results of Operations, a decrease in cash paid for Taum Sauk incident related costs (net of insurance recoveries) of $6 million, and a decrease in income tax payments (net of refunds) of $79 million. At CIPS, cash from operating activities decreased in 2007, compared with 2006. The Illinois electric settlement agreement resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of $19 million, including $74 million of customer refunds, credits, and program funding, and related reimbursements from nonaffiliated Illinois generators of $55 million. As of the end of 2007, $13 million was due from nonaffiliated generators. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a complete discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Cash from operations was further reduced by a decrease in electric margins and higher expenses, as discussed in Results of Operations. In addition, there was an increase in working capital investment, as the collection of higher electric rates from customers lagged payments for power purchases, and past due customer accounts increased because of higher rates. Income tax payments (net of refunds) decreased $18 million, benefiting cash flows from operations. Gencos cash from operating activities increased in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because electric margins increased, as discussed in Results of Operations, and because cash spent for fuel inventory decreased. In 2006, large cash outlays were made to replenish coal inventory after delivery disruptions caused by train derailments. Reducing these increases in cash from operating activities was an increase in income tax payments (net of refunds) of $41 million. Cash from operating activities decreased for CILCORP and CILCO in 2007, compared with 2006. The Illinois electric settlement agreement resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of $12 million: $41 million of customer refunds, credits, and program funding, minus related reimbursements from nonaffiliated Illinois generators of $29 million. As of the end of 2007, $7 million was due from nonaffiliated generators. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of  51 Table of Contents this report for a complete discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Working capital investment increased because the collection of higher electric rates from customers lagged payments for power purchases, past due customer accounts increased due to higher rates, and inventory levels increased at AERG due to an extended plant outage. In addition, income tax payments (net of refunds) increased $20 million for CILCORP and $18 million for CILCO. Increased electric and gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, benefited cash flows from operating activities. IPs cash from operating activities decreased in 2007, compared with 2006. The Illinois electric settlement agreement resulted in a 2007 net cash outflow of $24 million: $96 million of customer refunds, credits, and program funding, minus related reimbursements from nonaffiliated Illinois generators of $72 million. As of the end of 2007, $14 million was due from nonaffiliated generators. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a complete discussion of the Illinois electric settlement agreement. Further reducing cash from operating activities compared to the prior year was a reduction in electric margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, and a $13 million increase in pension and postretirement benefit contributions. Working capital investment increased because the collection of higher electric rates from customers lagged payments for power purchases, and past due customer accounts increased because of higher rates. Income tax payments (net of refunds) increased by $27 million, further reducing cash flows from operations. Pension Funding Amerens pension plans are funded in compliance with income tax regulations and to achieve federal funding or regulatory requirements. As a result, Ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the greater of the pension expense or the legally required minimum contribution. Based on Amerens assumptions at December 31, 2008, and investment performance in 2008, and reflecting this pension funding policy, Ameren expects to make annual contributions of $90 million to $200 million in each of the next five years. We expect UEs, CIPS, Gencos, CILCOs, and IPs portion of the future funding requirements to be 61%, 6%, 10%, 9% and 14%, respectively. These amounts are estimates; the numbers may change with actual asset performance, changes in interest rates, any pertinent changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions. In 2008, Ameren contributed $66 million to its pension plans. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report and Outlook for additional information. Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2008 versus 2007 Ameren used more cash for investing activities during 2008, compared with 2007. Net cash used for capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of power plant scrubber projects, upgrades at various power plants, and reliability improvements of the transmission and distribution system. Additionally, increased purchases and higher prices resulted in a $105 million increase in nuclear fuel expenditures. UEs cash used in investing activities increased during 2008, compared with 2007. Nuclear fuel expenditures increased $105 million resulting from increased purchases for future refueling outages at its Callaway nuclear plant and higher prices. In addition, capital expenditures increased $249 million. This increase was a result of increased spending related to a power plant scrubber project, reliability improvements of the transmission and distribution system, and various plant upgrades. This increase was partially offset by UEs receipt of $36 million in proceeds from intercompany note receivables with Ameren, and one of its subsidiaries. CIPS cash used in investing activities during 2008 increased compared with 2007. Capital expenditures increased $17 million in 2008 from 2007 primarily because of reliability improvements of the transmission and distribution system. During both years, this was offset by cash received from payments on an intercompany note receivable. Gencos cash used in investing activities increased in 2008 compared with the same period in 2007. Capital expenditures increased $126 million, principally due to a power plant scrubber project. This increase was offset, in part, by a $7 million decrease in emission allowance purchases. CILCORPs and CILCOs cash used in investing activities increased in 2008, compared with 2007. Cash used in investing activities increased as a result of a $65 million increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to a power plant scrubber project and plant upgrades at AERG. The receipt of net repayments of money pool advances in 2007 compared to 2008 also increased cash flows used in investing activities in 2008. IPs cash used in investing activities increased in 2008 compared with 2007. Capital expenditures increased by $8 million in 2008 from 2007 primarily because of reliability improvements of the transmission and distribution system. Net money pool advances increased by $44 million in 2008 compared with 2007. 2007 versus 2006 Ameren used more cash for investing activities in 2007 than in 2006. Net cash used for capital expenditures increased in 2007 as a result of power plant scrubber installation projects, other upgrades at various power plants, and reliability improvements of the transmission and 52 Table of Contents distribution systems, but this increase was reduced by the absence in 2007 of CT acquisitions that occurred in 2006. The $43 million decrease in 2007 of proceeds from sales of noncore properties also increased net cash used in investing activities. An $18 million decrease in emission allowance purchases benefited cash flows from investing activities, while cash received in 2007 for emission allowance sales was $66 million less than in the prior year, because remaining allowances are expected to be retained for environmental compliance needs. UEs cash used in investing activities decreased in 2007, compared with 2006, principally because of the $292 million expended for CT purchases in 2006 that was not spent in 2007. Otherwise, capital expenditures increased $135 million because of storm repair costs, a power plant scrubber installation project, and other upgrades at various power plants. Other impacts on cash used in investing activities were the absence of sales of noncore properties in 2007 compared with a $13 million sale in 2006, and the 2006 receipt of $67 million in proceeds from an intercompany note related to the transfer of UEs Illinois territory to CIPS. Additionally, nuclear fuel expenditures increased $29 million in 2007 over 2006 because of a refueling outage, and sales of emission allowances decreased $35 million because remaining allowances are being retained for environmental compliance needs. CIPS cash used in investing activities decreased in 2007, compared with 2006. CIPS investing cash flow was positively affected by a $3 million increase in proceeds from CIPS note receivable from Genco in 2007 compared with 2006 and the lack of a 2006 $17 million expenditure to repurchase its own outstanding bond. Capital expenditures were $3 million lower in 2007 than in 2006. Genco had an increase in net cash used in investing activities for 2007, compared with 2006. This increase was due primarily to a $106 million increase in capital expenditures related to a scrubber project at one of its power plants and various other plant upgrades. Emission allowance purchases decreased by $6 million. CILCORPs and CILCOs cash used in investing activities increased in 2007, compared with 2006. Cash flow used in investing activities increased as a result of a $135 million increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to a power plant scrubber project and other plant upgrades at AERG. The absence in 2007 of $11 million of proceeds received in 2006 from the sale of leveraged leases, and (for CILCORP only) the absence in 2007 of a 2006 note receivable payment from Ameren Energy Resources Company in the amount of $71 million related to the 2005 transfer of leveraged leases from CILCORP to Ameren Energy Resources Company, contributed to the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007. The net year over year reduction of $83 million and $84 million in money pool advances for CILCORP and CILCO, respectively, and a $12 million reduction of emission allowance purchases benefited cash flows from investing activities in 2007. IPs net use of cash in investing activities for 2007 was comparable with 2006. See Environmental Capital Expenditures below and Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of future environmental capital investment estimates. Capital Expenditures The following table presents the capital expenditures by the Ameren Companies for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006: Capital Expenditures 2008 2007 2006 Ameren(a) $ 1,896 $ 1,381 $ 1,284 UE 874 625 782 CIPS 96 79 82 Genco 317 191 85 CILCORP 319 254 119 CILCO (Illinois Regulated) 61 64 53 CILCO (AERG) 258 190 66 IP 186 178 179 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries. Amerens 2008 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE spent $149 million toward a scrubber at one of its power plants, and incurred storm damage related expenditures of $12 million. CIPS and IP incurred storm damage related expenditures of $7 million and $8 million, respectively. At Genco and AERG, there were cash outlays of $205 million and $137 million, respectively, for power plant scrubber projects. The scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental regulations. Other capital expenditures were principally to maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP as well as various plant upgrades. Amerens 2007 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE spent $101 million toward a scrubber at one of its power plants, and incurred storm damage related expenditures of $56 million. IP incurred storm damage related expenditures of $24 million. At Genco and AERG, there were cash outlays of $102 million and $76 million, respectively, for power plant scrubber projects. In conjunction with the scrubber project, AERG also made expenditures for a power plant boiler upgrade of $45 million. Other capital expenditures were principally to maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP as well as various plant upgrades. Amerens 2006 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE purchased three CTs totaling $292 million. In addition, UE spent $40 million toward a scrubber at one of its power plants, and incurred storm damage related expenditures of 53 Table of Contents $47 million. CIPS and IP incurred storm damage related expenditures of $16 million and $27 million, respectively. At Genco and AERG, there were cash outlays of $24 million and $11 million, respectively, for scrubber projects. Genco also made expenditures for a power plant boiler upgrade of $16 million. Other capital expenditures were principally to maintain, upgrade and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP. The following table estimates the capital expenditures that will be incurred by the Ameren Companies from 2009 through 2013, including construction expenditures, capitalized interest and allowance for funds used during construction (except for Genco and AERG, which have no allowance for funds used during construction), and estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental standards: 2009 2010 2013 Total UE $ 835 $ 3,335 $ 4,435 $ 4,170 $ 5,270 CIPS 90 350 475 440 565 Genco 270 1,180 1,500 1,450 1,770 CILCO (Illinois Regulated) 75 250 340 325 415 CILCO (AERG) 85 440 555 525 640 IP 220 715 960 935 1,180 EEI 50 255 335 305 385 Other 60 75 100 135 160 Ameren(a) $ 1,685 $ 6,600 $ 8,700 $ 8,285 $ 10,385 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries. UEs estimated capital expenditures include transmission, distribution and generation related activities, as well as expenditures for compliance with new environmental regulations discussed below. CIPS, CILCOs (Illinois Regulated), and IPs estimated capital expenditures are primarily for electric and gas transmission and distribution related activities. Gencos estimated capital expenditures are primarily for compliance with environmental regulations and upgrades to existing coal and gas fired generating facilities. CILCO (AERG)s estimate includes capital expenditures primarily for compliance with environmental regulations at AERGs generating facilities, as well as generation related activities. We continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs. As a result, we could modify our plan for generation capacity, which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and whether capacity or power may be purchased, among other things. In addition, Ameren and Genco are currently considering divestiture of some of Gencos smaller non rate regulated generating units. Any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material. As a result of the disruption and uncertainties in the capital and credit markets, we are actively evaluating opportunities to defer or reduce our planned capital spending. This included reducing our 2009 expenditures from previously expected levels. See Outlook in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 of this report for further discussion. Environmental Capital Expenditures Ameren, UE, Genco, AERG and EEI will incur significant costs in future years to comply with existing federal EPA and state regulations regarding SO2, NOx and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants. In May 2005, the EPA issued regulations with respect to SO2 and NOx emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions (the Clean Air Mercury Rule). The federal Clean Air Interstate Rule requires generating facilities in 28 eastern states, including Missouri and Illinois where our generating facilities are located, and the District of Columbia to participate in cap and trade programs to reduce annual SO2 emissions, annual NOx emissions, and ozone season NOx emissions. The cap and trade program for both annual and ozone season NOx emissions went into effect on January 1, 2009. The SO2 emissions cap and trade program is scheduled to take effect in 2010. In February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a decision that vacated the federal Clean Air Mercury Rule. The court ruled that the EPA erred in the method used to remove electric generating units from the list of sources subject to the maximum available control technology requirements under the Clean Air Act. The EPA and a group representing the electric utility industry filed petitions for rehearing; however, the court denied those petitions in May 2008. A group representing the electric utility industry and the EPA filed petitions for review of the U.S. Court of Appeals decision with the U.S. Supreme Court in September 2008 and October 2008, respectively. In February 2009, the EPA withdrew its petition to the U.S. Supreme Court. In February 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for review filed by a group representing the electric utility industry. The impact of this decision is that the EPA will move forward with a MACT standard for mercury emissions. The standard is expected to be available in draft form by mid to late 2009, and compliance is expected to be required in the 2013 to 2015 timeframe. We are currently evaluating the impact that the court decision will have on our environmental compliance strategy. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of this legal proceeding, the actions the EPA or U.S. Congress may take in response to the court decision and the timing of such actions. We also cannot predict at this time the ultimate impact the court decision and resulting regulatory actions will have on our estimated capital costs for compliance with environmental rules. In July 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a decision that vacated the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule. The court ruled that the regulation contained several fatal flaws, including a regional cap and trade 54 Table of Contents program that cannot be used to facilitate the attainment of ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter. In September 2008, the EPA as well as several environmental groups, a group representing the electric utility industry and the National Mining Association filed petitions for rehearing with the U.S. Court of Appeals. In December 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals essentially reversed their July 2008 decision to vacate the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule. The U.S. Court of Appeals granted the EPA petition for reconsideration and decided to remand the rule to the EPA for further action to remedy the rules flaws in accordance with the U.S. Court of Appeals July 2008 opinion in the case. The impact of the decision is that the existing Illinois and Missouri rules to implement the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule will remain in effect until the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule is revised by the EPA at which point the Illinois and Missouri rules may be subject to change. The state of Missouri adopted state rules to implement the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule for regulating SO2 and NOx emissions from electric generating units in Missouri. The rules are a significant part of Missouris plan to attain existing ambient standards for ozone and fine particulates, as well as meeting the requirements of the federal Clean Air Visibility Rule. As a result of the Missouri rules, UE will manage emission allowances and install pollution control equipment. Missouri also adopted state rules to implement the federal Clean Air Mercury Rule; however, the state rules are not enforceable as a result of the U.S. Court of Appeals decision to vacate the federal Clean Air Mercury Rule. We do not believe the court decision that vacated the federal Clean Air Mercury Rule will significantly affect pollution control obligations in Illinois. Under the MPS, Illinois generators may defer until 2015 the requirement to reduce mercury emissions by 90% in exchange for accelerated installation of NOx and SO2 controls. To comply with the rule, Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI have begun putting into service equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions. As a result of the Illinois rules, Genco, AERG and EEI will need to procure allowances and install pollution control equipment. Current plans include the installation of scrubbers for SO2 reduction and optimizing operations of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems for NOx reduction at certain coal fired plants in Illinois. In October 2008, Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI submitted a request for a variance from the MPS to the Illinois Pollution Control Board. In preparing this request, Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI worked with the Illinois EPA and agreed to the installation of more stringent SO2 and NOx controls at various stages between 2010 and 2020 in order to make the variance proposal environmentally neutral. In January 2009, the Illinois Pollution Control Board denied the variance request on procedural grounds. Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI filed a motion for reconsideration in February 2009 and, with the Illinois EPAs concurrence, seek to amend the MPS within a pending rulemaking pertaining to technical amendments of the underlying mercury regulations. Revisions to the MPS within that rulemaking will require Illinois Pollution Control Board approval. If approved, this variance or rule amendment could allow Genco to defer approximately $375 million of environmental capital expenditures from the 2009 2012 timeframe to the 2013 2015 timeframe. This amount is reduced from the $500 million disclosed in Gencos Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the period ended September 30, 2008, because of revisions to the size and timing of projected environmental capital expenditures if no variance is granted. A decision is expected in 2009. The EPA finalized regulations in March 2008 that will lower the ambient standard for ozone. States must submit their nonattainment plans in March 2009. A final action by the EPA to designate areas as nonattainment is expected in March 2010, and state implementation plans will need to be submitted in 2013 unless Illinois and Missouri seek extensions of various requirement dates. Additional emission reductions may be required as a result of future state implementation plans. At this time, we are unable to determine the impact such state actions would have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.  55 Table of Contents The table below presents estimated capital costs that are based on current technology to comply with the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule and related state implementation plans through 2018 as well as federal ambient air quality standards including ozone and fine particulates, and the federal Clean Air Visibility rule. The estimates described below could change depending upon additional federal or state requirements, the implementation of any revisions to the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule, the requirements under a mercury MACT standard, whether the variance or rule amendment request with respect to the Illinois MPS discussed above is granted, new technology, variations in costs of material or labor, or alternative compliance strategies, among other reasons. The timing of estimated capital costs may also be influenced by whether emission allowances are used to comply with any future rules, thereby deferring capital investment. 2009 2010 2013 2014 2018 Total UE(a) $ 100 $ 525 $ 655 $ 1,530 $ 1,885 $ 2,155 $ 2,640 Genco 230 875 1,085 95 125 1,200 1,440 AERG 55 365 455 60 80 480 590 EEI 15 120 155 530 660 665 830 Ameren $ 400 $ 1,885 $ 2,350 $ 2,215 $ 2,750 $ 4,500 $ 5,500 (a) UEs expenditures are expected to be recoverable in rates over time. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of environmental matters. Cash Flows from Financing Activities 2008 versus 2007 During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Ameren Companies issued $1.9 billion of senior debt. The proceeds were used to repurchase, redeem and fund maturities of $842 million of long term debt, to reduce short term borrowings, and to fund capital expenditures and other working capital needs at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO, and IP. During the year ended December 31, 2007, net short term debt borrowings of $860 million and long term borrowings of $674 million were used to fund $488 million of maturities of long term debt, to fund working capital needs at Ameren subsidiaries and to build liquidity during a period of legislative uncertainty in Illinois. Additionally, CILCO redeemed the remaining shares of its 5.85% Class A preferred stock to complete the mandatory sinking fund redemption requirement resulting in a $16 million use of cash during 2008 compared with 2007. Benefiting 2008, compared with 2007, was a $63 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of Ameren common stock, which resulted from increased sales through Amerens 401(k) plan and DRPlus. UEs net cash from financing activities increased in the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. During 2008, UE used $699 million in proceeds from the issuance of senior secured notes to redeem outstanding auction rate environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds that had adjusted to higher rates as a result of the collapse of the auction rate securities market, and to fund the current maturity of UEs 6.75% first mortgage bonds. Additionally, net short term borrowings increased $321 million. These borrowings were primarily used to fund working capital needs and capital expenditures. In 2007, UE issued $424 million in senior secured notes and received a $380 million capital contribution from Ameren to fund working capital requirements and to reduce net short term debt borrowings. CIPS had a net use of cash from financing activities in 2008, compared with a net source of cash in 2007. This change was because CIPS used net money pool borrowings and existing cash to fund a net reduction in short term debt, to redeem $35 million of auction rate environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds that had adjusted to higher rates as a result of the collapse of the auction rate securities market, and to fund the maturity of $15 million of its 5.375% senior secured notes during 2008. In 2007, CIPS used net short term debt borrowings of $90 million to fund working capital needs and build liquidity and to fund $40 million of common stock dividends. Genco issued $300 million of 7.00% senior unsecured notes during 2008, which resulted in a net source of cash from financing activities compared with a net use of cash in 2007. The proceeds from the issuance were used to fund capital expenditures and other working capital requirements, including a net reduction of $200 million of short term borrowings during 2008 compared with 2007. CILCORPs and CILCOs cash provided by financing activities decreased in 2008 compared with 2007. This decrease was primarily the result of CILCORPs and CILCOs net repayments of short term borrowings during 2008 compared with 2007. These repayments were funded by a net increase in money pool borrowings of $98 million, primarily at AERG, and CILCOs issuance of $150 million of its 8.875% senior secured notes. Partially offsetting the decrease were reduced redemptions and maturities of long term debt in 2008. During 2008, $19 million of auction rate environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds that had adjusted to higher rates as a result of the collapse of the auction rate securities market were redeemed at CILCO. In 2007, $50 million of CILCOs 7.50% bonds matured. Also benefiting cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008, were net borrowings of a $150 million direct loan from Ameren at CILCORP compared with $71 million net repayments during 2007. 56 Table of Contents IPs cash from financing activities decreased in 2008, compared with 2007. During 2008, IP issued $730 million of senior secured notes and used the proceeds to redeem all of IPs outstanding auction rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds that had adjusted to higher rates as a result of the collapse of the auction rate securities market and repay short term debt. Additionally, during 2008, IP funded $60 million of common stock dividends to Ameren and had net short term debt repayments of $175 million. Comparatively, during 2007, IP issued $250 million of senior secured notes, paid $61 million of common stock dividends and had $100 million of net borrowings under the 2007 credit facility. These borrowings were used to fund $87 million of long term debt maturities and $43 million of net money pool repayments to build liquidity in 2007. 2007 versus 2006 Ameren had an increase of $556 million in its net cash from financing activities in 2007, compared to 2006. Positive effects on cash included a net increase of $441 million in net short term debt proceeds in 2007 over 2006, and a $442 million increase in the issuance of long term debt. These increased proceeds were used to fund a $324 million increase in redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long term debt and to fund the working capital needs of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP. UE had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2007, compared with a net use of cash in 2006. The primary reasons for the change include a $380 million capital contribution from Ameren and the issuance of $424 million of senior secured notes in 2007. The proceeds were used to repay short term debt and to fund working capital and capital expenditures. Other net uses of cash in 2007 included the repayment of a note Ameren issued in 2006 and an $18 million increase in common stock dividend payments. CIPS had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2007, compared with a net use of cash in 2006. This was primarily the result of an increase of $55 million in net short term debt proceeds in 2007 over 2006, and a $10 million decrease in dividend payments. Cash was also positively affected in 2007 by a $20 million decrease in redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long term debt and the absence in 2007 of the 2006 payments of $67 million on an intercompany note with UE. Cash flows in 2006 benefited from $61 million in proceeds from long term debt issuances that did not recur in 2007. Genco had a net increase in cash used in financing activities for 2007 over 2006, principally because of a $125 million decrease in capital contributions received from Ameren. Cash benefited in 2007 by a $100 million increase in net proceeds from short term debt. CILCORP had a net source of cash from financing activities in 2007, compared with a net use of cash in 2006. CILCOs cash provided by financing activities increased in 2007, compared with 2006. Net money pool repayments decreased $154 million at CILCORP and $161 million at CILCO. A net increase in short term debt of $90 million at CILCORP and $15 million at CILCO in 2007 resulted in a positive effect on cash. In 2007, CILCORP and CILCO did not issue any dividends on common stock; in 2006 CILCORP issued $50 million and CILCO $65 million. As a result, cash flows from financing activities benefited in 2007 as compared to 2006. Additionally, in 2006 a note payable to Ameren was repaid, which resulted in a net use of cash of $113 million at CILCORP. Note payable repayments were only $71 million in 2007. These positive effects on cash were reduced by the lack of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in 2007 compared with $96 million at both CILCORP and CILCO in 2006. IP had an increase in its net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 compared with 2006. This was primarily the result of an increase in proceeds from short term debt and a $175 million increase from the issuance of long term debt. The proceeds from the 2007 long term debt issuance were used to repay borrowings under the Ameren utility money pool and under the 2007 credit facility. Other net uses of cash included $61 million of common stock dividends in 2007. Short term Borrowings and Liquidity External short term borrowings typically consist of drawings under committed bank credit facilities. See Note 4 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on credit facilities, short term borrowing activity, relevant interest rates, and borrowings under Amerens utility and non state regulated subsidiary money pool arrangements. The following table presents the various committed bank credit facilities of the Ameren Companies and AERG, and their availability as of December 31, 2008: Credit Facility Expiration Amount Committed Amount Available(a) Ameren, UE and Genco: Multiyear revolving(b) July 2010 $ 1,150 $ 540 (f) CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG: 2007 Multiyear revolving(c)(d) January 2010 500 415 2006 Multiyear revolving(c)(e) January 2010 500 220 (a) After excluding $75 million and $17 million of unfunded Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB participations as of December 31, 2008, under the $1.15 billion credit facility and 2006 $500 million credit facility, respectively. 57 Table of Contents (b) Ameren Companies may access this credit facility through intercompany borrowing arrangements. (c) See Note 4 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for discussion of the amendments to these facilities. (d) The maximum amount available to each borrower under this facility at December 31, 2008, including for the issuance of letters of credit, was limited as follows: CILCORP $125 million, CILCO $75 million, IP $200 million and AERG $100 million. CIPS and CILCO have the option of permanently reducing their ability to borrow under the 2006 $500 million credit facility and shifting such capacity, up to the same limits, to the 2007 $500 million credit facility. In July 2007, CILCO shifted $75 million of its sublimit under the 2006 $500 million credit facility to this facility. (e) The maximum amount available to each borrower under this facility at December 31, 2008, including for the issuance of letters of credit, was limited as follows: CIPS $135 million, CILCORP $50 million, CILCO $75 million, IP $150 million and AERG $200 million. In July 2007, CILCO shifted $75 million of its capacity under this facility to the 2007 $500 million credit facility. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2008, CILCO had a sublimit of $75 million under this facility and a $75 million sublimit under the 2007 credit facility. (f) In addition to amounts drawn on this facility, the amount available is further reduced by standby letters of credit issued under the facility. The amount of such letters of credit at December 31, 2008, was $9 million. Ameren can directly borrow under the $1.15 billion facility, as amended, up to the entire amount of the facility. UE can directly borrow under this facility up to $500 million on a 364 day basis. Genco can directly borrow under this facility up to $150 million on a 364 day basis. The amended facility will terminate on July 14, 2010, with respect to all borrowers thereunder. The termination date for UE and Genco is July 9, 2009, subject to the annual 364 day renewal provisions for their individual sublimits under the facility. This facility was also available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short term borrowing authorizations, by EEI or other Ameren non state regulated subsidiaries through direct short term borrowings from Ameren and by most of Amerens non rate regulated subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Ameren Services, Resources Company, Genco, AERG, Marketing Company and AFS, through a non state regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to coordinate and to provide for certain short term cash and working capital requirements. Separate money pools are maintained for utility and non state regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services enables IP to make short term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money pool agreement, together with any outstanding external short term borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500 million, pursuant to authorization from the ICC. IP is not currently borrowing under the unilateral borrowing agreement. On September 15, 2008, Lehman filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. As of December 31, 2008, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, a subsidiary of Lehman, had lending commitments of $100 million and $21 million under the $1.15 billion credit facility and the 2006 $500 million credit facility, respectively. At this time, we do not know if Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB will seek to assign to other parties any of its commitments under our credit facilities. Assuming Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB does not fund its pro rata share of funding requests under these two facilities, and such participations are not assigned or otherwise transferred to other lenders, total amounts accessible by the Ameren Companies and AERG will be limited to amounts not less than $1.05 billion under the $1.15 billion credit facility and $479 million under the 2006 $500 million credit facility. The Ameren Companies and AERG do not believe that the potential reduction in available capacity under the credit facilities if Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB does not fund its commitments will have a material impact on their liquidity. On June 25, 2008, Ameren entered into a $300 million term loan agreement due June 24, 2009, which was fully drawn on June 26, 2008. See Note 4 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. On January 21, 2009, Ameren entered into a $20 million term loan agreement due January 20, 2010, which was fully drawn on January 21, 2009. See Note 4 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the money pool agreements. See Note 4 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement. In addition to committed credit facilities, a further source of liquidity for the Ameren Companies from time to time is available cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2008, Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP had $92 million, less than $1 million, less than $1 million, $2 million, less than $1 million, less than $1 million and $50 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. The issuance of short term debt securities by Amerens utility subsidiaries is subject to approval by FERC under the Federal Power Act. In March 2008, FERC issued an order authorizing these utility subsidiaries to issue short term debt securities subject to the following limits on outstanding balances: UE $1 billion, CIPS $250 million, and CILCO $250 million. The authorization was effective as of April 1, 2008, and terminates on March 31, 2010. IP has unlimited short term debt authorization from FERC. 58 Table of Contents Genco was authorized by FERC in its March 2008 order to have up to $500 million of short term debt outstanding at any time. AERG and EEI have unlimited short term debt authorization from FERC. The issuance of short term debt securities by Ameren and CILCORP (parent) is not subject to approval by any regulatory body. The Ameren Companies continually evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of their credit arrangements given changing business conditions. When business conditions warrant, changes may be made to existing credit agreements or other short term borrowing arrangements. Long term Debt and Equity The following table presents the issuances of common stock and the issuances, redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt and preferred stock (net of any issuance discounts and including any redemption premiums) for the years 2008, 2007 and 2006 for the Ameren Companies and EEI. For additional information related to the terms and uses of these issuances and the sources of funds and terms for the redemptions, see Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

(b) In June 2008, UE, as a well known seasoned issuer, filed a Form S 3 shelf registration statement registering the issuance of an indeterminate amount of certain types of securities, which expires in June 2011. In July 2008, Ameren filed a Form S 3 registration statement with the SEC authorizing the offering of six million additional shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at Amerens option, newly issued shares, treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Ameren is also currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under its 401(k) plan pursuant to an effective SEC Form S 8 registration statement. Under DRPlus and its 401(k) plan (including a subsidiary plan that is now merged into the Ameren 401(k) plan), Ameren issued 4.0 million, ($154 million) shares of common stock in 2008, 1.7 million ($91 million) in 2007, and 1.9 million ($96 million) in 2006. Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP may sell all or a portion of the remaining securities registered under their effective registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant such a sale. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus that meets the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants See Note 4 Short term Borrowings and Liquidity and Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions (and applicable cross default provisions) contained in our bank credit and term loan facilities and in certain of the Ameren Companies indenture agreements and articles of incorporation. At December 31, 2008, the Ameren Companies were in compliance with their credit facility, term loan agreement, indenture, and articles of incorporation provisions and covenants. We consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows. Inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses. After assessing our current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets or make access to the capital markets uncertain or limited. Such events could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. 60 Table of Contents Dividends Ameren paid to its shareholders common stock dividends totaling $534 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2008, $527 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2007, and $522 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2006. This resulted in a payout rate based on net income of 88% in 2008, 85% in 2007, and 95% in 2006. Dividends paid to common shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the same periods were 35% in 2008, 48% in 2007 and 41% in 2006. On February 13, 2009, the board of directors of Ameren declared a quarterly dividend on Amerens common stock of 38.5 cents per share, payable on March 31, 2009, to shareholders of record on March 11, 2009. The boards action was consistent with an annualized dividend of $1.54 per share, or a 39% reduction from the previous annual dividend level of $2.54 per share. The new annualized dividend rate of $1.54 per share would represent a payout rate of 53% based on 2008 net income. The amount and timing of dividends payable on Amerens common stock are within the sole discretion of Amerens board of directors. The board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends. However, as it has done in the past, the board of directors is expected to consider various issues, including Amerens overall payout ratio, payout ratios of our peers, projected cash flow and potential future cash flow requirements, historical earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, return on investments with similar risk characteristics, impacts of regulatory orders or legislation, and other key business considerations. Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the Ameren Companies payment of dividends in certain circumstances. At December 31, 2008, except as discussed below with respect to the 2007 $500 million credit facility and the 2006 $500 million credit facility, none of these circumstances existed at the Ameren Companies and, as a result, they were allowed to pay dividends. UE would be restricted as to dividend payments on its common and preferred stock if it were to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures. CIPS articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Gencos indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making any dividend payments on common stock if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold. CILCORP has common and preferred stock dividend payment restrictions if leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met, or if CILCORPs senior long term debt does not have the ratings described in its indenture. CILCO has restrictions in its articles of incorporation on dividend payments on common stock relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock. The 2007 $500 million credit facility and the 2006 $500 million credit facility limit CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP to common and preferred stock dividend payments of $10 million per year each if CIPS, CILCOs or IPs senior secured long term debt securities or first mortgage bonds, or CILCORPs senior unsecured long term debt securities, have received a below investment grade credit rating from either Moodys or S&P. With respect to AERG, which currently is not rated by Moodys or S&P, the common and preferred stock dividend restriction will not apply if its ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated operating cash flow, pursuant to a calculation defined in the facilities, is less than or equal to 3.0 to 1. CILCORPs senior unsecured credit ratings from Moodys and S&P are below investment grade, causing it to be subject to this dividend payment limitation. As of December 31, 2008, AERG failed to meet the debt to operating cash flow ratio test in the 2007 and 2006 $500 million credit facilities. AERG therefore is currently limited in its ability to pay dividends to a maximum of $10 million per fiscal year. The other borrowers thereunder are not currently limited in their dividend payments by this provision of the 2007 or 2006 $500 million credit facilities. The following table presents common stock dividends paid by Ameren Corporation and by Amerens subsidiaries to their respective parents. 2008 2007 2006 UE $ 264 $ 267 $ 249 CIPS 40 50 Genco 101 113 113 CILCORP(a) 50 IP 60 61 Nonregistrants 109 46 60 Dividends paid by Ameren $ 534 $ 527 $ 522 (a) CILCO paid to CILCORP dividends of $ million, $ million and $65 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 61 Table of Contents Certain of the Ameren Companies have issued preferred stock on which they are obligated to make preferred dividend payments. Each companys board of directors considers the declaration of the preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which the dividend is payable and the amount to be paid. See Note 10 Stockholder Rights Plan and Preferred Stock to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred stock issuances. Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding expected minimum funding levels for our pension plans. These expected pension funding amounts are not included in the table below. In addition, routine short term purchase order commitments are not included.

Amerens $2 million annual obligation for these items is included in the Less than 1 Year, 1 3 Years, and 3 5 Years columns. Amounts for After 5 Years are not included in the total amount because that period is indefinite. (f) See Other Obligations within Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8 of this report, for discussion of items represented herein. (g) Represents parent company only. The Ameren Companies adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes on January 1, 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits under the provisions of FIN 48 were $110 million, $20 million, $ million, $47 million, $25 million, $25 million and $ million for Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP, respectively. It is reasonably possible to expect that the settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit will result in an underpayment or overpayment of tax and related interest. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the timing of cash payments or receipts associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The amount and timing of certain payments is not reliably estimable or determinable at this time. See Note 13 Income Taxes under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding the Ameren Companies unrecognized tax benefits and related liabilities for interest expense. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2008, none of the Ameren Companies had any off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future. Credit Ratings The following table presents the principal credit ratings of the Ameren Companies by Moodys, S&P and Fitch effective on the date of this report: Moodys S&P Fitch Ameren: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa3 BBB BBB+ Senior unsecured debt Baa3 BB+ BBB+ UE: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa2 BBB A Secured debt Baa1 BBB A+ CIPS: Issuer/corporate credit rating Ba1 BBB BBB Secured debt Baa3 BBB+ BBB+ Senior unsecured debt Ba1 BBB BBB Genco: Issuer/corporate credit rating BBB BBB+ Senior unsecured debt Baa3 BBB BBB+ CILCORP: Issuer/corporate credit rating BBB BBB Senior unsecured debt Ba2 BB+ BBB CILCO: Issuer/corporate credit rating Ba1 BBB BBB Secured debt Baa2 BBB+ A IP: Issuer/corporate credit rating Ba1 BBB BBB Secured debt Baa3 BBB BBB+ 63 Table of Contents Moodys Ratings Actions On February 12, 2008, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Ameren and Genco but changed their rating outlook to negative from stable. Moodys placed the long term credit ratings of UE under review for possible downgrade and affirmed UEs commercial paper rating. In addition, Moodys affirmed the ratings of CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP and maintained a positive rating outlook on these four companies. According to Moodys, the review of UEs ratings was prompted by declining cash flow coverage metrics, increased operating costs, higher capital expenditures for environmental compliance and transmission and distribution system investment, and significant regulatory lag in the recovery of these costs. Moodys stated that the negative outlook on the credit rating of Genco reflected Gencos position as a predominantly coal generating company that is likely to be seriously affected by more stringent environmental regulations, including a potential cap or tax on carbon emissions. The negative outlook on the ratings of Ameren, according to Moodys, reflects the factors that impacted its subsidiaries, UE and Genco. On May 21, 2008, Moodys lowered the credit ratings of UE to Baa1 for its senior secured debt and to Baa2 for its issuer rating and changed the rating outlook to stable. In its reasons for these actions, Moodys reiterated the items noted above, attributing the declining cash flow metrics to increased fuel and purchased power costs, growing capital expenditures for environmental compliance and for transmission system reliability, and higher labor costs. They noted that UE was one of the few utilities in the country at the time of their report operating without fuel, purchased power, and environmental cost recovery mechanisms. Moodys also placed UEs commercial paper rating on review for possible downgrade due to its review of Amerens short term rating as noted below. At the same time, the ratings of Ameren and Genco were changed from negative outlook to being on review for possible downgrade. On August 13, 2008, Moodys downgraded both the issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings of Ameren and the senior unsecured debt rating of Genco to Baa3 from Baa2 and changed the outlooks on these ratings to stable. Moodys also downgraded the commercial paper ratings of Ameren and UE to P 3 from P 2. Moodys stated that these downgrades were because of declining consolidated coverage ratios over the last several years and the expectation that ongoing cost pressures and the lack of timely regulatory recovery of some costs will prevent ratios from returning to historical levels in the near term. On January 29, 2009, Moodys affirmed the ratings of CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP and changed their rating outlooks to stable from positive. According to Moodys, the change in the rating outlooks of these four companies was based on the near term expiration of the 2007 and 2006 $500 million credit facilities in January 2010 and related liquidity concerns. Moodys also on January 29, 2009, affirmed the ratings of Ameren and UE with a stable outlook based on the January 2009 MoPSC electric rate order approving a rate increase and a FAC for UE. On February 16, 2009, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP with a stable outlook. The affirmation reflects Moodys view that Amerens announcement to reduce its common dividend by 39% is a conservative, prudent, and credit positive action that will conserve cash and support financial coverage metrics. Moodys stated that the more conservative dividend payout should also help facilitate the renewal of Amerens credit facilities that expire in 2010. They stated the dividend reduction should continue to reduce reliance on the credit facilities going forward and will likely be viewed favorably by lenders considering renewing or entering into new facilities with Ameren and its subsidiaries, which is important considering currently constrained credit market conditions. According to Moodys, the stable outlook on Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP reflects recently constructive rate case outcomes at UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP, including the approval of a FAC at UE; the improving regulatory environments for investor owned utilities in Illinois and Missouri; and Moodys expectation that financial and cash flow coverage metrics should remain adequate to maintain current rating levels. In addition, Moodys notes that the recent dividend reduction is supportive of the stable ratings outlooks and provides Ameren and its subsidiaries additional cushion at current rating levels. S&P Ratings Actions On March 19, 2008, S&P raised its senior unsecured debt ratings for CIPS to BBB from B+ and for CILCORP to BB from B+. On September 11, 2008, S&P upgraded its corporate credit ratings on CILCORP, CILCO, CIPS and IP to BBB from BB. Senior secured debt ratings at CILCO and CIPS were upgraded to BBB+ from BBB and were upgraded at IP to BBB from BBB . CILCORPs senior unsecured debt rating was raised to BB+ from BB. All of Amerens other ratings were affirmed and all outlooks were stable. At the same time, S&P raised the business profiles of CIPS and IP to strong from satisfactory. The business profiles of CILCORP and CILCO remain satisfactory. S&P stated that the ratings upgrades were due to its assessment that the regulatory and political environment in Illinois will be reasonably supportive of investment grade credit quality with regard to the Ameren Illinois Utilities then pending rate cases. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the order issued by the ICC in these rate cases on September 24, 2008. On February 25, 2009, S&P stated that it viewed the reduction in Amerens dividend as credit supportive. S&P did not make any changes in Amerens or its subsidiaries credit ratings or outlooks as a result of this action. S&P raised the business profile of UE to excellent from 64 Table of Contents strong to reflect the recent electric rate order issued by the MoPSC, which S&P viewed as constructive. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the rate order issued by the MoPSC on January 27, 2009. S&P lowered the business profile of CILCO to satisfactory from strong reflecting S&Ps concerns regarding large capital expenditures needed to meet environmental compliance standards, while relying on falling market prices, due to the economic recession, for recovery. Fitch Ratings Actions On October 16, 2008, Fitch upgraded its issuer credit ratings on CILCO to BBB from BB+ and on CILCORP, CIPS and IP to BBB from BB+. The senior secured debt ratings were raised at CIPS and IP to BBB+ from BBB and at CILCO to A from BBB. Senior unsecured debt ratings were raised at CIPS and IP to BBB from BBB , at CILCO to BBB+ from BBB , and at CILCORP to BBB from BB+. The outlook for each of these entities was changed to stable from rating watch positive. Fitch stated that the ratings upgrades were a result of the expected positive financial impact of electric and gas rate case decisions issued by the ICC in September 2008 and the reduction in business risk associated with the Illinois electric settlement agreement in 2007. On February 17, 2009, Fitch stated that the reduction in Amerens common stock dividend and other cost cutting measures will be favorable to bondholders and credit quality. Fitch did not make any changes in Amerens or its subsidiaries ratings or outlooks as a result of this action. Collateral Postings Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. Such changes may also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel, power and gas supply, among other things, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. Collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties at December 31, 2008, were $109 million, $15 million, $26 million, $16 million, $16 million, and $36 million at Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP, respectively. The amount of collateral external counterparties posted with Ameren was $7 million at December 31, 2008. Sub investment grade issuer or senior unsecured debt ratings (lower than BBB or Baa3) at December 31, 2008, could have resulted in Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO or IP being required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to $202 million, $67 million, $24 million, $19 million, $36 million, $36 million, and $51 million, respectively. In addition, changes in commodity prices could trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. The cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can also increase or decrease depending upon the credit ratings of the borrower. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. It should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk under Part II, Item 7A, for information on credit rating changes with respect to insured tax exempt auction rate bonds. OUTLOOK Below are some key trends that may affect the Ameren Companies financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in 2009 and beyond. Economy and Capital and Credit Markets The global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in 2008, and we expect those conditions to continue throughout 2009 and potentially longer. Several factors have driven this situation, including deteriorating global economic conditions and the weakened condition of major financial institutions, as evidenced by the bankruptcy of Lehman. These conditions have led governments around the world to establish policies and programs that are designed to strengthen the global financial system, to enhance liquidity, and to restore investor confidence. We believe that these events have several implications for the capital and credit markets, the economy and our industry as a whole, including Ameren. They include the following: Access to Capital Markets The extreme disruption in the capital markets has limited the ability of many companies, including the Ameren Companies, to freely access the capital and credit markets to support their operations and to refinance debt. We are unable to predict how long these conditions will persist, but we expect the capital markets to remain uncertain throughout 2009 and potentially longer. However, we believe we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, as evidenced by IPs sale of $400 million in senior secured notes in October 2008 and CILCOs sale of $150 million of senior secured notes in December 2008. CILCORP and IP have long term debt maturities of $124 million and $250 million, respectively, in 2009. In addition, Amerens $300 million term loan agreement is due in 2009. We currently expect to issue approximately $650 million of debt at our rate regulated utilities, $250 million at Ameren, and approximately $500 million at the non rate regulated generation subsidiaries in 2009. Credit Facilities At December 31, 2008, the Ameren Companies had in place revolving bank credit facilities aggregating $2.15 billion. In total, 18 financial institutions participated in these credit facilities. In January 2010, $1 billion of these facilities expire, and the revolving $1.15 billion facility expires in July 2010. Due to the Lehman bankruptcy filing, the size of these facilities was effectively reduced by up to $121 million. We cannot predict whether other lenders that are currently participating in our credit facilities will declare 65 Table of Contents bankruptcy or otherwise fail to honor their commitments thereunder, and thus reduce the level of access to credit facilities. We are actively developing plans and strategies to renew these facilities prior to their expiration dates. We are unable to predict the degree of success we will have in renewing or replacing any of these facilities and whether the size and terms of any new credit facilities will be comparable to the existing facilities. Cost of Capital The disruption in the capital and credit markets has led to higher financing costs compared with recent years. We expect this trend to continue while the current level of uncertainty in the financial markets persists. Economic Conditions We believe that the disruption in the capital and credit markets will further weaken global economic conditions. Limited access to capital and credit and higher cost of capital for businesses and consumers will reduce spending and investment, result in job losses, and pressure economic growth for the foreseeable future. These weak economic conditions will likely result in volatility in the power and commodity markets, greater risk of defaults by our counterparties, weaker customer sales growth, particularly with respect to industrial sales, higher bad debt expense, and possible impairment of goodwill and long lived assets, among other things. The estimated fair values of CILCORPs Illinois Regulated reporting unit and Non rate regulated Generation reporting unit exceeded carrying values by a nominal amount as of October 31, 2008, when we conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill. As a result, the failure in the future of either of these reporting units to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows or a decrease in observable market multiples, may reduce their estimated fair value below their carrying value and would likely result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge. We will continue to monitor the actual and forecasted operating results and cash flows of these reporting units for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value and potential goodwill impairment. We would not necessarily expect any future goodwill impairment charge recorded at the CILCORP reporting unit level to also result in a goodwill impairment charge at the consolidated Ameren level because of the aggregation of reporting units. To date, the level of defaults by counterparties, lower sales growth, and bad debt expense resulting from the weak economy have not significantly affected the Ameren Companies. However, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these weak economic conditions on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Investment Returns The disruption in the capital markets, coupled with weak global economic conditions, has adversely affected financial markets. As a result, we experienced lower than assumed investment returns in 2008 in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The market value of plan assets in 2008 declined by 7% and 26% within the pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively, compared with assumed 2008 investment returns of 8.25% for both funds. These lower returns will increase our future pension and postretirement expenses and pension funding levels. Our future expenses and funding levels will also be affected by future discount rate levels. Based on Amerens assumptions at December 31, 2008, and investment performance in 2008, and reflecting Amerens pension funding policy, Ameren expects to make annual contributions of $90 million to $200 million in each of the next five years. Operating and Capital Expenditures The Ameren Companies will continue to make significant levels of investments and incur expenditures for their electric and natural gas utility infrastructure in order to improve overall system reliability, comply with environmental regulations, and improve plant performance. However, due to the significant level of disruption and uncertainties in the capital and credit markets, we are actively evaluating opportunities to defer or reduce planned capital spending and operating expenses to mitigate the risks associated with accessing these uncertain markets. We took action in this regard by reducing 2009 operating and capital expenditures from levels previously expected. Separately, Genco, AERG and EEI are seeking a variance from the Illinois Pollution Control Board to an environmental requirement in Illinois that, while environmentally neutral, would defer approximately $375 million of Gencos environmental capital expenditures scheduled for 2009 through 2012 to subsequent years. Any expenditure control initiatives would be balanced against our continued long term commitment to invest in our electric and natural gas infrastructure to provide safe, reliable electric and natural gas delivery services to our customers; to meet federal and state environmental, reliability, and other regulations; and the need to maintain a solid overall liquidity and credit ratings profile to meet our operating, capital and financing needs under challenging capital and credit market conditions. Liquidity At February 13, 2009, Ameren, on a consolidated basis, had available liquidity, in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under its existing credit facilities, of approximately $1.3 billion, excluding unfunded Lehman bank facility participation commitments, which was $448 million higher than the same time last year. We expect our available liquidity to remain at acceptable levels through the end of 2009 as we strategically access the capital markets and execute the expenditure control initiatives. However, we are unable to predict whether significant changes in economic conditions, further disruption in the capital and credit markets, or other unforeseen events could materially impact our estimate. Although we believe that the uncertainty in the capital and credit markets will persist throughout 2009 and potentially longer, we do believe that actions taken by the U.S. government and governments around the world will 66 Table of Contents ultimately help ease the extreme volatility and disruption of these markets. In addition, we believe we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. As discussed above, additional financings are expected through 2009, subject to market conditions. Also, in February 2009, Amerens board of directors made the decision to reduce the common stock dividend. The dividend was reduced to enhance Amerens financial strength and flexibility as the company executes its long term business strategy through the dramatically weakened state of the economy and the continued uncertainties in the capital, credit, and commodity markets. In addition, Amerens board of directors was mindful of the companys current business mix and need to make reliability and environmental infrastructure investments. Specifically, this dividend reduction would be consistent with an annual dividend level that would allow Ameren to retain approximately $215 million of cash annually, which would provide incremental funds to enhance reliability to meet our customers expectations; satisfy federal and state environmental requirements; reduce our reliance on dilutive equity and high cost debt financings; and enhance our access to the capital and credit markets. We believe that our expected operating cash flows, capital expenditures, and related financing plans (including accessing our existing credit facilities) will provide the necessary liquidity to meet our operating, investing, and financing needs through the end of 2009, at a minimum. However, there can be no assurance that significant changes in economic conditions, further disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or other unforeseen events will not materially impact our ability to execute our expected operating, capital or financing plans, including our plans to renew or replace our existing credit facilities. Current Capital Expenditure Plans Between 2009 and 2018, Ameren expects that certain Ameren Companies will be required to invest between $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion to retrofit their coal fired power plants with pollution control equipment in compliance with emissions related environmental laws and regulations. Any pollution control investments will result in decreased plant availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately 50% of this investment is expected to be in our Missouri Regulated operations, and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers. The recoverability of amounts expended in Non rate regulated Generation operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions reflecting increased environmental costs for generators. Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force Ameren and other similarly situated electric power generators to close some coal fired facilities. Investments to control carbon emissions at Amerens coal fired power plants would significantly increase future capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses. UE continues to evaluate its longer term needs for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity. At this time, UE does not expect to require new baseload generation capacity until 2018 to 2020. However, due to the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload power plant, UE is actively studying future plant alternatives, including those that would use coal or nuclear fuel. In July 2008, UE filed a COLA with the NRC for a potential new nuclear unit at UEs existing Callaway County, Missouri, nuclear plant site. Pursuant to DOEs procedures, in 2008 UE filed with the DOE Part I and Part II of its application for a loan guarantee to support the potential construction and operation of a new nuclear unit. UE has also signed contracts for certain long lead time nuclear unit related equipment (heavy forgings). The filing of the COLA and the DOE loan guarantee application and entering into these contracts does not mean a decision has been made to build a new nuclear unit. These are only the first steps in the regulatory licensing and procurement process. They are necessary actions to preserve the option to develop a new nuclear unit. As of December 31, 2008, UE spent $52 million and $6 million on the COLA and heavy forgings, respectively. If UE elects not to build a new nuclear unit, we believe the COLA and heavy forgings could be sold in the open market during this time of expected growth in the nuclear industry. The Missouri Clean and Renewable Energy Construction Act was introduced in the Missouri Senate and House of Representatives in early 2009. This bill would allow the MoPSC to authorize the use of certain financing tools for constructing clean and renewable electric generation, including a tool that would allow utilities to recover the costs of financing and tax payments associated with a new generating plant while that plant is being constructed. UE has stated that legislation allowing timely recovery of financing costs during construction must be enacted in order for UE to elect to build a new nuclear unit to meet its baseload generation capacity needs. However, passage of such legislation does not commit or guarantee that UE will elect to build a new nuclear unit. UE is unable to predict whether this legislation will be adopted by lawmakers. UE intends to submit a license extension application with the NRC to extend its Callaway nuclear plants operating license by 20 years so that the operating license will expire in 2044. UE cannot predict whether or when the NRC will approve the license extension. Over the next few years, we expect to make significant investments in our electric and natural gas infrastructure and to incur increased operations and maintenance expenses to improve overall system reliability. We are projecting higher labor and material costs for these capital expenditures. We expect these costs or investments at our rate regulated businesses 67 Table of Contents to be ultimately recovered in rates, although regulatory lag could materially impact our cash flows and related financing needs. Increased investments for environmental compliance, reliability improvement, and new baseload capacity will result in higher depreciation and financing costs. Revenues The earnings of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are largely determined by the regulation of their rates by state agencies. Rising costs, including fuel and related transportation, purchased power, labor, material, depreciation and financing costs, coupled with increased capital and operations and maintenance expenditures targeted at enhanced distribution system reliability and environmental compliance, are expected. Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP anticipate regulatory lag until requests to increase rates to continue to recover such costs on a timely basis are granted by state regulators. Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP expect more frequent rate cases will be necessary in the future. UE has agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate case before March 15, 2010. The ICC issued a consolidated order in September 2008 approving a net increase in annual revenues for electric delivery service of $123 million in the aggregate (CIPS $22 million increase, CILCO$3 million decrease and IP $104 million increase) and a net increase in annual revenues for natural gas delivery service of $38 million in the aggregate (CIPS $7 million increase, CILCO $9 million decrease, and IP $40 million increase), based on a 10.65% return on equity with respect to electric delivery service and a 10.68% return on equity with respect to natural gas delivery service. These rate changes were effective on October 1, 2008. Because of the Ameren Illinois Utilities pledge to keep the overall residential electric bill increase resulting from these rate changes during the first year to less than 10% for each utility, IP will not recover approximately $10 million in revenue in the first year the electric delivery service rates are in effect. Thereafter, residential electric delivery service rates will be adjusted to recover the full increase. In addition, the ICC changed the depreciable lives used in calculating depreciation expense for the Ameren Illinois Utilities electric and natural gas rates. As a result, annual depreciation expense for the Ameren Illinois Utilities will be reduced for financial reporting purposes by a net $13 million in the aggregate (CIPS $4 million reduction, CILCO $26 million reduction, and IP $17 million increase). Because of continuing investments in the Ameren Illinois Utilities infrastructure, rising operating costs and costs of capital, the Ameren Illinois Utilities are not expected to earn the return on equity allowed in the ICC September 2008 consolidated order. The Ameren Illinois Utilities return on equity in 2009 is estimated to be approximately 6%. As a result, rate case filings with the ICC are being targeted for late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2009. The MoPSC issued an electric rate order in January 2009 approving an increase in annual electric revenues of approximately $162 million based on a 10.76% return on equity, a capital structure composed of 52% common equity, and a rate base of $5.8 billion. The rate change was effective March 1, 2009. In addition, pursuant to the accounting order issued by the MoPSC in April 2008, the rate order concluded that the $25 million of operations and maintenance expenses incurred as a result of a severe ice storm in January 2007 should be amortized and recovered over a five year period starting March 1, 2009. The MoPSC also allowed recovery of $12 million of costs associated with a March 2007 FERC order that resettled costs among MISO market participants. UE recorded a regulatory asset for these costs at December 31, 2008, which will be amortized and recovered over a two year period beginning March 1, 2009. Because of continuing investments in UEs utility infrastructure, rising operating costs and costs of capital, UE is not expected to earn the return on equity allowed in the MoPSCs January 2009 electric rate order during 2009. UEs return on equity in 2009 is estimated to be approximately 8%. As a result, UE expects to file another electric rate case in Missouri later this year. The exact timing will depend on the timing and magnitude of cost increases and rate base additions, among other things. In current and future rate cases, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP will continue to seek cost recovery and tracking mechanisms from their state regulators to reduce regulatory lag. In the ICC consolidated electric and natural gas rate order issued in September 2008, the ICC rejected the Ameren Illinois Utilities requested rate adjustment mechanisms for electric infrastructure investments. As an alternative to the Ameren Illinois Utilities requested decoupling of natural gas revenues from sales volumes, the ICC order approved an increase in the percentage of costs to be recovered through fixed non volumetric residential and commercial customer charges to 80% from 53%. This increase will impact 2009 quarterly results of operations and cash flows but is not expected to have any impact on annual margins. The ICC also approved an increase in the Supply Cost Adjustment (SCA) factors for the Ameren Illinois Utilities. The SCA is a charge applied only to the bills of customers who take their power supply from the Ameren Illinois Utilities. The change in the SCA factors is expected to result in increased electric revenues of $9.5 million per year in the aggregate (CIPS $2.6 million, CILCO $1.6 million, and IP $5.3 million) covering the increased cost of administering the Ameren Illinois Utilities power supply responsibilities. In the MoPSC electric rate order issued in January 2009, the MoPSC approved UEs implementation of a FAC and a vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism. The FAC allows an adjustment of electric rates three times per year for a pass through to customers of 95% of changes in fuel 68 Table of Contents and purchased power costs, net of off system revenues, including MISO costs and revenues, above or below the amount set in base rates, subject to MoPSC prudency review. The vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism provides for the tracking of expenditures that are greater or less than amounts provided for in UEs annual revenues for electric service in a particular year, subject to a 10% limitation on increases in any one year. The tracked amounts may be reflected in rates set in future rate cases. UE provides power to Norandas smelter plant in New Madrid, Missouri, which has historically used approximately four million megawatthours of power annually, making Noranda UEs single largest customer. As a result of a major winter ice storm in January 2009, Norandas smelter plant experienced a power outage related to non UE lines delivering power to the substation serving the plant. Noranda stated that the outage affected approximately 75% of the smelter plants capacity and that based on preliminary information and managements initial assessment, restoring full plant capacity may take up to 12 months, with partial capacity phased in during the 12 month period. To the extent UEs sales to Noranda are reduced, generation made available could be sold as off system sales. However, the FAC approved in the 2009 MoPSC electric rate order would require UE to flow substantially all of the off system revenues to customers. If this were to occur, and the Noranda smelter plant operates at 25% capacity for 12 months, UE estimates its pretax earnings during such period could be reduced by up to approximately $73 million due to the loss of up to approximately 3.2 million megawatthours of retail sales. In order to adjust the FAC for this unanticipated event, UE sought rehearing by the MoPSC of its January 2009 electric rate order in February 2009, to allow UE to first recover from the off system sales any revenues it would lose as a result of the reduced tariff sales to Noranda with any excess revenues collected being provided to customers through the FAC. Also in February 2009, other parties to the rate case filed for rehearing of certain aspects of the MoPSC order. In February 2009, the MoPSC denied all rate case rehearing requests filed by UE and other parties. UE continues to consider other alternatives to recover any lost revenues resulting from the Noranda power outage. The Illinois electric settlement agreement reached in 2007 provides approximately $1 billion over a four year period that began in 2007 to fund rate relief for certain electric customers in Illinois, including approximately $488 million to customers of the Ameren Illinois Utilities. Funding for the settlement is coming from electric generators in Illinois and certain Illinois electric utilities. The Ameren Illinois Utilities, Genco, and AERG agreed to fund an aggregate of $150 million, of which the following contributions remained to be made at December 31, 2008: Ameren CIPS CILCO (Illinois Regulated) IP Genco CILCO (AERG) 2009(a) $ 26.6 $ 3.9 $ 1.9 $ 5.1 $ 10.8 $ 4.9 2010(a) 1.9 0.3 0.1 0.4 0.8 0.3 Total $ 28.5 $ 4.2 $ 2.0 $ 5.5 $ 11.6 $ 5.2 (a) Estimated. In January 2009, the ICC approved the electric power procurement plan filed by the IPA for both the Ameren Illinois Utilities and Commonwealth Edison Company. The plan outlined the wholesale products (capacity, energy swaps, and renewable energy credits) that the IPA will procure on behalf of the Ameren Illinois Utilities for the period of June 1, 2009, through May 30, 2014. The products will be procured through a RFP process, during the first half of 2009. The Ameren Illinois Utilities will be allowed to pass through to customers the costs of procuring electric power supply with no markup by the utility, plus any reasonable costs that the utility incurs in arranging and providing for the supply of electric power. As part of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, the Ameren Illinois Utilities entered into financial contracts with Marketing Company (for the benefit of Genco and AERG), to lock in energy prices for 400 to 1,000 megawatts annually of their round the clock power requirements during the period June 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012, at then relevant market prices. These financial contracts do not include capacity, are not load following products and do not involve the physical delivery of energy. Under the terms of the Illinois electric settlement agreement, these financial contracts are deemed prudent, and the Ameren Illinois Utilities are permitted full recovery of their costs in rates. In addition, the Illinois electric settlement agreement would allow the Ameren Illinois Utilities to lease or invest in generation facilities, subject to ICC approval. Volatile power prices in the Midwest can affect the amount of revenues Ameren, UE (though to a lesser extent after the implementation of UEs FAC), Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI generate by marketing power into the wholesale and spot markets and can influence the cost of power purchased in the spot markets. Lower prices are expected in 2009 as compared with 2008. The availability and performance of UEs, Gencos, AERGs and EEIs electric generation fleet can materially impact their revenues. Genco and AERG are seeking to raise the equivalent availability and capacity factors of their power plants over the long term through greater investments and a process improvement program. The Non rate regulated Generation segment expects to generate 30 million megawatthours of power in 2009 (Genco 16 million, AERG 7 million, EEI 7 million) based on expected power prices in 2009. Should power 69 Table of Contents prices rise more than expected in 2009, the Non rate regulated Generation segment has the capacity and availability to sell more generation. In 2008, two million contracted megawatthours of Gencos and AERGs legacy power supply agreements, which had an average embedded selling price of $33 per megawatthour, expired. These agreements were replaced with market based sales. The marketing strategy for the Non rate regulated Generation segment is to optimize generation output in a low risk manner to minimize volatility of earnings and cash flow, while seeking to capitalize on its low cost generation fleet to provide solid, sustainable returns. To accomplish this strategy, the Non rate regulated Generation segment has established hedge targets for near term years. Through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts, Marketing Company targets to hedge Non rate regulated Generations expected output by 80% to 90% for the following year, 50% to 70% for two years out, and 30% to 50% for three years out. As of February 13, 2009, Marketing Company had sold approximately 95% of Non rate regulated Generations expected 2009 generation, at an average price of $53 per megawatthour, and had sold approximately 60% of Non rate regulated Generations 2010 generation at an average price of $51 per megawatthour. The development of ancillary services and capacity markets in MISO could increase the electric margins of UE, Genco, AERG and EEI. Ancillary services are services necessary to support the transmission of energy from generation resources to loads while maintaining reliable operation of the transmission providers system. MISOs regional wholesale ancillary services market began in January 2009. We expect MISO will begin development of a capacity market now that its ancillary services market is in place. A capacity requirement obligates a load serving entity to acquire capacity sufficient to meet its obligations. UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities have committed to developing energy efficiency programs for their customers. UE expects it will spend $24 million on electric energy efficiency programs in 2009. That number will increase to $56 million annually by 2015. The Ameren Illinois Utilities expect to spend $14 million, $29 million, and $45 million in the 2008, 2009, and 2010 program years, respectively, in accordance with their electric energy efficiency and demand response plan approved by the ICC in 2007. The Ameren Illinois Utilities also expect to spend $2 million, $4 million, and $6 million in the 2009, 2010, and 2011 program years, respectively, in accordance with their natural gas energy efficiency plan approved by the ICC in 2008. The Illinois program years run from June 1 through May 31. The costs incurred by the Ameren Illinois Utilities are recoverable from customers through rate riders. Future energy efficiency programs developed by UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP and others could also result in reduced demand for our electric generation and our electric and gas transmission and distribution services. Fuel and Purchased Power In 2008, 85% of Amerens electric generation (UE 77%, Genco 99%, AERG 99%, EEI 100%) was supplied by coal fired power plants. About 96% of the coal used by these plants (UE 97%, Genco 98%, AERG 77%, EEI 100%) was delivered by rail from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. In the past, deliveries from the Powder River Basin have been restricted because of rail maintenance, weather, and derailments. As of December 31, 2008, coal inventories for UE, Genco, AERG and EEI were at targeted levels. Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause UE, Genco, AERG and EEI to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low margin periods, buying higher cost fuels to generate required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources. Genco is incurring incremental fuel costs in 2009 to replace coal from an Illinois mine that was prematurely closed by its owner at the end of 2007. A settlement agreement reached with the coal mine owner in June 2008 fully reimbursed Genco, in the form of a lump sum payment of $60 million, for increased costs for coal and transportation that it incurred in 2008 ($33 million) and expects to incur in 2009 ($27 million). The entire settlement was recorded in 2008 earnings, so Amerens and Gencos earnings in 2009 will be lower than they otherwise would have been. The annual NOx trading program under the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule was reinstated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in December 2008. At this time, Genco and AERG may not have sufficient NOx allowances to meet forecasted 2009 obligations under the annual NOx trading program. The costs of these allowances would depend on market prices at the time these allowances are purchased. Genco and AERG currently estimate that they could incur additional fuel expense in 2009 of $11 million and $5 million, respectively, to purchase additional NOx allowances to come into compliance with the program. Amerens fuel costs (including transportation) are expected to increase in 2009 and beyond. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report for additional information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for 2009 through 2013. Other Costs In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility. This resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which damaged a state park. UE has settled with the FERC and the state of Missouri all issues associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident. In addition, UE received approval from FERC to rebuild the upper reservoir at its Taum Sauk plant and is in the process of rebuilding the facility. The estimated cost to rebuild the upper reservoir is in the range of $480 million. UE expects the Taum Sauk plant to be out of service through early 2010. UE believes 70 Table of Contents that substantially all damages and liabilities caused by the breach, including costs related to the settlement agreement with the state of Missouri, the cost of rebuilding the plant, and the cost of replacement power, up to $8 million annually, will be covered by insurance. Insurance will not cover lost electric margins and penalties paid to FERC. Under UEs insurance policies, all claims by or against UE are subject to review by its insurance carriers. As a result of this breach, UE is engaged in litigation initiated by certain private parties and the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers. We are unable to predict the timing or outcomes of this litigation, or its possible effect on UEs results of operation, financial position, or liquidity. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of Taum Sauk matters. UEs Callaway nuclear plant had a 28 day scheduled refueling and maintenance outage during the fourth quarter of 2008. UEs Callaway nuclear plants next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage is in the spring of 2010. During a scheduled outage, which occurs every 18 months, maintenance and purchased power costs increase, and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases, versus non outage years. Over the next few years, we expect rising employee benefit costs, as well as higher insurance premiums as a result of insurance market conditions and loss experience, among other things. Other Under an executory tolling agreement, CILCO purchased steam, chilled water, and electricity from Medina Valley, which CILCO in turn sold to an industrial customer. In January 2009, CILCO transferred both the tolling agreement and the related power supply agreement with the industrial customer to Marketing Company. The transfer of these agreements is expected to benefit CILCOs non rate regulated 2009 pretax operating generation income by $6 million compared with its 2008 operating income. A ballot initiative passed by Missouri voters in November 2008 created a renewable energy portfolio requirement. UE and other Missouri investor owned utilities will be required to purchase or generate electricity from renewable energy sources equaling at least 2% of native load sales by 2011, with that percentage increasing in subsequent years to at least 15% by 2021, subject to a 1% limit on customer rate impacts. At least 2% of each portfolio requirement must be derived from solar energy. Compliance with the renewable energy portfolio requirement can be achieved through the procurement of renewable energy or renewable energy credits. Rules are required to be issued by the MoPSC to implement the law. UE expects that any related costs or investments would ultimately be recovered in rates. The above items could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase Amerens shareholder value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed. The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. REGULATORY MATTERS See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. ACCOUNTING MATTERS Critical Accounting Estimates Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. These estimates involve judgments regarding many factors which in and of themselves could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. We have outlined below the critical accounting estimates that we believe are most difficult, subjective or complex. Any change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results. Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application  Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery All of the Ameren Companies, except Genco, defer costs as regulatory assets in accordance with SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and make investments that they assume will be collected in future rates. Regulatory environment and external regulatory decisions and requirements Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact Impact of deregulation, rate freezes, and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs Basis for Judgment We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. If facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is probably no longer recoverable, we record a charge to earnings, which could be material. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for quantification of these assets by registrant. 71 Table of Contents Accounting Estimate Unbilled Revenue At the end of each period, we project expected usage, and we estimate the amount of revenue to record for services that have been provided to customers but not yet billed. Uncertainties Affecting Application Projecting customer energy usage Estimating impacts of weather and other usage affecting factors for the unbilled period Estimating loss of energy during transmission and delivery Basis for Judgment We base our estimate of unbilled revenue each period on the volume of energy delivered, as valued by a model of billing cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class for our service area. This figure is then adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and weather variations based on historical results. See the balance sheets for each of the Ameren Companies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for unbilled revenue amounts. Derivative Financial Instruments We account for derivative financial instruments under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities, as amended, and related interpretations and measure their fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, and related interpretations. The identification and classification of a derivative and the fair value of such derivative must be determined. See Commodity Price Risk and Fair Value of Contracts in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 8 Fair Value Measurements to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Amerens ability to consume or produce notional values of derivative contracts Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility and liquidity Valuation assumptions on longer term contracts due to lack of observable inputs Effectiveness of our derivatives that have been designated as hedges Counterparty default risk Basis for Judgment We determine whether to exclude the fair value of certain derivatives from valuation under the normal purchase and normal sales provisions of SFAS No. 133 based upon our intent and ability to physically deliver commodities purchased and sold. Further, our forecasted purchases and sales also support our designation of some fair valued derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. Fair value of our derivatives is measured in accordance with SFAS No. 157, which provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Without observable inputs, we use certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation. Our valuations also reflect our own assessment of counterparty default risk using the best internal and external information available. If we were required to discontinue our use of the normal purchase and normal sales exception or cash flow hedge treatment for some of our contracts, the impact of changes in fair value for the applicable contracts could be material to our earnings. Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long Lived Assets, and Asset Retirement Obligations We assess the carrying value of our goodwill, intangible assets, and long lived assets to determine whether they are impaired. We also review for the existence of asset retirement obligations. If an asset retirement obligation is identified, we determine its fair value and subsequently reassess and adjust the obligation, as necessary. Managements identification of impairment indicators Changes in business, industry, laws, technology, or economic and market conditions Valuation assumptions and conclusions Estimated useful lives of our significant long lived assets Actions or assessments by our regulators Identification of an asset retirement obligation and assumptions about the timing of asset removals Basis for Judgment Annually, or whenever events indicate a valuation may have changed, we use various valuation methodologies to determine valuations, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples, and discounted, undiscounted, and probabilistic discounted cash flow models with multiple scenarios. The identification of asset retirement obligations is conducted through the review of legal documents and interviews. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for quantification of our goodwill and intangible assets. 72 Table of Contents Accounting Estimate Benefit Plan Accounting Based on actuarial calculations, we accrue costs of providing future employee benefits in accordance with SFAS Nos. 87, 106, 112 and 158, which provide guidance on benefit plan accounting. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Uncertainties Affecting Application Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations Health care cost trend rates Timing of employee retirements and mortality assumptions Ability to recover certain benefit plan costs from our ratepayers Changing market conditions impacting investment and interest rate environments Basis for Judgment Our ultimate selection of the discount rate, health care trend rate, and expected rate of return on pension and other plan assets is based on our consistent application of assumption setting methodologies and our review of available historical, current, and projected rates, as applicable. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for sensitivity of Amerens benefit plans to potential changes in these assumptions. Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Nonretail electric rates are regulated by FERC. Adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that reviews a historical period. As a result, revenue increases will lag behind changing prices. Inflation affects our operations, earnings, stockholders equity, and financial performance. The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers. As a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years. Our Non rate regulated Generation businesses do not have regulated recovery mechanisms. Historically, in UEs Missouri electric utility jurisdiction, there was no tariff for adjusting rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of purchased power. As a part of the electric rate order issued by the MoPSC on January 27, 2009, UE was granted permission to put in place, effective March 1, 2009, a FAC. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on UEs electric rate order. In July 2005, a law was enacted that enables the MoPSC to also put in place mechanisms for Missouris utilities to recover environmental costs directly from customers outside of a rate case proceeding. The MoPSC initiated a proceeding in December 2008 to develop revised rules for the environmental cost recovery mechanisms. Rules for the environmental cost recovery mechanism are expected to be approved by the MoPSC during the second quarter of 2009 and will be effective once published in the Missouri Register. UE will not be able to implement an environmental cost recovery mechanism until so authorized by the MoPSC as part of a rate case proceeding. Effective January 2, 2007, ICC approved tariffs in Illinois allow CIPS, CILCO and IP to recover power supply costs from electric customers by adjusting rates to accommodate changes in power prices. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on the Illinois electric rate settlement agreement that addressed legislative and other efforts to limit full recovery of power costs in Illinois. In our Missouri and Illinois retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. During 2008, the MoPSC approved two UE requests to recover gas infrastructure replacement costs through the establishment of an ISRS. UE commenced recovering annual revenues of $2 million in the aggregate, effective in March and November 2008 through the ISRS. UE, Genco, CILCORP and AERG are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent that they must purchase natural gas to run CTs. These companies have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins, and to minimize the impact to their financial statements. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, below for further information. Also see Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information on the cost recovery mechanisms discussed above. 73 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument, derivative or nonderivative, caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates, commodity prices, and equity security prices. A derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value of some underlying asset. The following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. We handle market risks in accordance with established policies, which may include entering into various derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks, principally business, legal and operational risks, are not part of the following discussion. Our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets and to pursue market opportunities within prudent risk parameters. Our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee, which is composed of senior level Ameren officers. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with: long term and short term variable rate debt; fixed rate debt; commercial paper; and auction rate long term debt. We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we have within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. The following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by 1% on variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2008: Interest Expense Net Income(a) Ameren(b) $ 14 $ (9 ) UE 6 (3 ) CIPS 1 (1 ) Genco 1 (c ) CILCORP 5 (3 ) CILCO 3 (2 ) IP (c ) (c ) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Includes intercompany eliminations. (c) Less than $1 million. The estimated changes above do not consider potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would probably act to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. Insured Tax exempt Auction Rate Bonds Certain auction rate tax exempt environmental improvement and pollution control revenue bonds previously issued for the benefit of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP through governmental authorities were insured by monoline bond insurers. See Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a description and details of this indebtedness. As a result of developments in the capital markets with respect to residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, the credit rating agencies have downgraded the credit ratings of the monoline bond insurers that insured such securities. As a result, our insured auction rate bonds were similarly downgraded. In 2008, we experienced higher interest expense and or failed auctions, in which there were not sufficient clearing bids in an auction to set the interest rate for a portion of our auction rate bonds. According to press reports, many other series of auction rate securities similarly experienced failed auctions. To mitigate the effect of these credit ratings downgrades and the resulting impact on the interest rates of our auction rate tax exempt environmental improvement and pollution control revenue bonds, we redeemed all of UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs outstanding auction rate bonds, except for UEs 1992 Series and 1998 Series A, B and C bonds, which had an aggregate balance of $207 million at December 31, 2008, and interest rates ranging from 1.313% to 9.975% during the year ended December 31, 2008. In April 2008, UE and IP issued senior secured notes in the principal amount of $250 million and $337 million, respectively, to refinance their auction rate indebtedness. See Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a description of these redemptions and refinancings. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted. NYMEX traded futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the NYMEX and have nominal credit risk. In all other transactions, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction. Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and executory contracts with market risk exposures. The risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base. 74 Table of Contents The 2007 increase in electric rates in Illinois, and a related increase in extended payment plan arrangements, resulted in an increase in the Ameren Illinois Utilities past due accounts receivable balances during 2007 and the first quarter of 2008. Such past due balances have improved during the last nine months of 2008, primarily as a result of enhanced collection efforts and an increase in the volume of write offs of past due balances deemed uncollectible. The Ameren Illinois Utilities will continue to monitor the impact of increased electric rates on customer collections and to make adjustments to their allowances for doubtful accounts, as deemed necessary, to ensure that such allowances are adequate to cover estimated uncollectible customer account balances. At December 31, 2008, no single nonaffiliated customer represented more than 10%, in the aggregate, of our accounts receivable. Our revenues are primarily derived from sales of electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and Illinois. UE, CIPS, Genco, AERG, IP, AFS, and Marketing Company may have credit exposure associated with interchange or wholesale purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2008, UEs, CIPS, Gencos, CILCOs, IPs, AFS, and Marketing Companys combined credit exposure to nonaffiliated non investment grade trading counterparties related to interchange or wholesale purchases and sales was less than $1 million, net of collateral (2007 less than $1 million). We establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program. It involves daily exposure reporting to senior management, master trading and netting agreements, and credit support, such as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze each counterpartys financial condition before we enter into sales, forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts, and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged lease. We estimate our credit exposure to MISO associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market to be $46 million at December 31, 2008 (2007 $63 million). The Ameren Illinois Utilities will be exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the parties contributing to the Illinois comprehensive rate relief and assistance programs under the Illinois electric settlement agreement. The agreement provides to certain electric customers of the Ameren Illinois Utilities $488 million in rate relief over a four year period that commenced in 2007. Under funding agreements among the parties contributing to the rate relief and assistance programs, at the end of each month, the Ameren Illinois Utilities bill the participating generators for their proportionate share of that months rate relief and assistance, which is due in 30 days, or drawn from the funds provided by the generators escrow. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, of this report for additional information. Equity Price Risk Our costs for providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, including the rate of return on plan assets. Ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in ERISA. Amerens goal is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment management to specialists in each asset class. Where appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after an analysis of historical experience, future expectations, and the volatility of the various asset classes. After considering the target asset allocation for each asset class, we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared with benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets. In future years, the costs of such plans reflected in net income, OCI, or regulatory assets, and cash contributions to the plans could increase materially, without pension asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 8%. See Outlook in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 of this report for discussion of the impact of 2008 investment returns. UE also maintains a trust fund, as required by the NRC and Missouri law, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning. As of December 31, 2008, this fund was invested primarily in domestic equity securities (55%) and debt securities (45%). It totaled $239 million (in 2007 $307 million). By maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk. However, the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. The fixed rate, fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options. UEs exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated, because UE is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs, which would include unfavorable investment results, through electric rates. 75 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk Ameren and UE are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk from UEs procurement agreement related to construction of a potential new nuclear unit. This agreement provides a fixed price for heavy forgings as well as consulting services to aid with design certification. The agreement requires UE to pay for goods and services in euros. UE uses foreign currency forward contracts for the purchase of euros to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which could affect the amount of U.S. dollars required to satisfy the obligation denominated in euros. To the extent the value of the U.S. dollar versus the euro declines, the effect would be reflected in construction work in process within property and plant, net, and would be subject to routine depreciation and impairment considerations. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity, fuel, and natural gas. UEs, Gencos, AERGs and EEIs risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements. Genco, AERG and EEI also seek to sell power forward to wholesale, municipal and industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices. We also attempt to mitigate financial risks through risk management programs and policies, which include forward hedging programs, and the use of derivative financial instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts, and financial swap contracts). However, a portion of the generation capacity of UE, Genco, AERG and EEI is not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices. The following table shows how our earnings might decrease if power prices were to decrease by 1% on unhedged economic generation for 2009 through 2012: Net Income(a) Ameren(b) $ (27) UE (10) Genco (9) CILCO (AERG) (3) EEI (7) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. Ameren also uses its portfolio management and trading capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy risk capital to generate additional returns. Due to our physical presence in the market, we are able to identify and pursue opportunities, which can generate additional returns through portfolio management and trading activities. All of this activity is performed within a controlled risk management process. We establish value at risk (VaR) and stop loss limits that are intended to prevent any negative material financial impact. On September 15, 2008, Lehman filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. At that time, UE, CIPS, Genco, IP, Marketing Company and AFS were counterparties with Lehman Brothers Commodity Services Inc. (Lehman Commodity Services), a subsidiary of Lehman, in energy commodity transactions that support their utility and generation businesses. The obligations of Lehman Commodity Services were guaranteed by Lehman, and the Lehman bankruptcy filing gives UE, CIPS, Genco, IP, Marketing Company and AFS the right to terminate any open transactions. On October 21, 2008, Ameren sent notice to Lehman Commodity Services terminating all transactions between UE, Genco, and Marketing Company and Lehman Commodity Services. As of December 31, 2008, Amerens and its subsidiaries direct exposure to Lehman Commodity Services, based on existing transactions and current market prices, was estimated to be less than $1 million before taxes, collectively. We manage risks associated with changing prices of fuel for generation using similar techniques as those used to manage risks associated with changing market prices for electricity. Most UE, Genco and AERG fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts. Genco, AERG and EEI do not have the ability to pass through higher fuel costs to their customers for electric operations. Prior to March 2009, UE did not have this ability either except through a general rate proceeding. As a part of the January 2009 MoPSC electric rate order, UE was granted permission to put a FAC in place which was effective March 1, 2009. The FAC allows UE to recover directly from its electric customers 95% of changes in fuel and purchased power costs, net of off system revenues, including MISO costs and revenues, above or below the amount set in base rates, subject to MoPSC prudency review. Thus, UE remains exposed to 5% of changes in its fuel and purchased power costs, net of off system revenues. UE, Genco, AERG and EEI have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal to manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility. Price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures, whereby the amount of coal purchased is determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year. UE, Genco, AERG and EEI generally purchase coal up to five years in advance, but we may purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable deals or market conditions. The strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions. Transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs. UE, Genco, AERG and EEI typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility. Natural gas transportation expenses for Amerens gas distribution utility companies and the gas fired generation units of UE, Genco, AERG and EEI are regulated by FERC through approved tariffs governing the rates, 76 Table of Contents terms and conditions of transportation and storage services. Certain firm transportation and storage capacity agreements held by the Ameren Companies include rights to extend the contracts prior to the termination of the primary term. Depending on our competitive position, we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariff rates for our requirements. The following table presents the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired power plants, nuclear fuel for UEs Callaway nuclear plant, natural gas for our CTs and retail distribution, as appropriate, and purchased power needs of CIPS, CILCO and IP, which own no generation, that are price hedged over the five year period 2009 through 2013, as of December 31, 2008. The projected required supply of these commodities could be significantly affected by changes in our assumptions for such matters as customer demand of our electric generation and our electric and natural gas distribution services, generation output, and inventory levels, among other matters. 2009 2010 2011 2013 Ameren: Coal 95 % 86 % 22 % Coal transportation 100 76 37 Nuclear fuel 100 100 81 Natural gas for generation 31 3 Natural gas for distribution(a) 84 36 13 Purchased power for Illinois Regulated(b) 80 57 32 UE: Coal 96 % 90 % 23 % Coal transportation 100 63 25 Nuclear fuel 100 100 81 Natural gas for generation 22 5 Natural gas for distribution(a) 85 45 13 CIPS: Natural gas for distribution(a) 87 % 40 % 16 % Purchased power(b) 80 57 32 Genco: Coal 94 % 87 % 16 % Coal transportation 100 67 45 Natural gas for generation 30 CILCORP/CILCO: Coal (AERG) 89 % 67 % 31 % Coal transportation (AERG) 100 67 46 Natural gas for distribution(a) 87 37 10 Purchased power(b) 80 57 32 IP: Natural gas for distribution(a) 80 % 31 % 13 % Purchased power(b) 80 57 32 EEI: Coal 96 % 89 % 24 % Coal transportation 100 100 67 (a) Represents the percentage of natural gas price hedged for peak winter season of November through March.

Coal Transportation Fuel Expense Net Income(a) Fuel Expense Net Income(a) Ameren(b) $ 37 $ (23) $ 17 $ (11) UE 15 (10) 13 (8) Genco 14 (8) 2 (1) CILCORP 5 (3) 1 (1) CILCO 5 (3) 1 (1) EEI 3 (2) 1 (1) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries. In addition, coal and coal transportation costs are sensitive to the price of diesel fuel as a result of rail freight fuel surcharges. If diesel fuel costs were to increase or decrease by $0.25/gallon, Amerens fuel expense could increase or decrease by $13 million annually (UE $7 million, Genco $3 million, AERG $1 million and EEI $2 million). As of December 31, 2008, Ameren had price hedged approximately 100% of expected fuel surcharges in 2009. In the event of a significant change in coal prices, UE, Genco, AERG and EEI would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources. With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel, UE has fixed priced and base price with escalation agreements, or it uses inventories that provide some price hedge to fulfill its Callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services. There is no fuel reloading scheduled for 2009 or 2012. UE has price hedges for 87% of the 2010 to 2013 nuclear fuel requirements. Although nuclear fuel market prices declined in 2008, pricing remains subject to an unpredictable supply and demand environment. UE has continued to follow a strategy of managing inventory of nuclear fuel as an inherent price hedge. New long term uranium contracts are almost exclusively market price related with an escalating price floor. New long term enrichment contracts usually have some market price related component. UE expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the Callaway nuclear plant, at prices which cannot now be accurately predicted. Unlike the electricity and natural gas markets, nuclear fuel markets have limited financial instruments available for price hedging, so most hedging is done through inventories and forward contracts, if they are available. With regard to the electric generating operations for UE, Genco and AERG that are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run CTs, the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs. We optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins. Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the MISO Day Two Energy Market. In addition, Marketing Company has acquired FTRs for its participation in the PJM Northern Illinois market. The FTRs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission congestion charges related to the physical electricity business. Depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid, FTRs could result in either charges or credits. Complex grid modeling tools are used to determine which FTRs to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is a risk of incorrectly modeling the amount of FTRs needed, and there is the potential that the FTRs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges. With regard to UEs natural gas distribution business and, commencing March 1, 2009, its electric distribution business, and to CIPS, CILCOs and IPs electric and natural gas distribution businesses, exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery mechanisms in place. These cost recovery mechanisms allow UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas supply costs. UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations for our regulated customers. The effects of price volatility cannot be eliminated. However, procurement strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier, as well as the management of physical assets. With regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for construction and maintenance activities, Ameren is exposed to changes in market prices for metal commodities and labor availability. See Supply for Electric Power under Part I, Item 1, of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal, nuclear power, natural gas, hydroelectric power, and oil. Also see Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. 78 Table of Contents Fair Value of Contracts Most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales. We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas, fuel, electricity, FTRs and emission allowances. Price fluctuations in natural gas, fuel, electricity, FTRs and emission allowances may cause any of these conditions: an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sales prices under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices; market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power that differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory under contracted commitment; or actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that differ from anticipated cash outlays. The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further information. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) changes in the fair value of all derivative contracts marked to market during the year ended December 31, 2008. We use various methods to determine the fair value of our contracts. In accordance with SFAS No. 157 hierarchy levels, our sources used to determine the fair value of these contracts were active quotes (Level 1), inputs corroborated by market data (Level 2), and other modeling and valuation methods that are not corroborated by market data (Level 3). All of these contracts have maturities of less than five years.
