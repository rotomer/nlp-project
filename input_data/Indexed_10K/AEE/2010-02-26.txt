ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Ameren Executive Summary Operations At Amerens rate regulated utilities, milder weather and the economic slowdown led to a 3% decrease in kilowatthour sales to residential and commercial customers in 2009, compared with 2008. However, this sales decline was smaller, an estimated 1%, on a weather normalized basis. The weak economy also led to a decline in kilowatthour sales by Amerens rate regulated utilities to their industrial customers. These sales declined 11% in 2009, compared with 2008, excluding the impact of reduced sales to Norandas smelter plant in New Madrid, Missouri. Norandas plant sustained damage because of a power interruption on non Ameren owned power lines during a severe ice storm in January 2009. As a result, the smelters load was sharply reduced but has been rising steadily as repairs have been made to the smelter plants production lines, with full production expected to be reached in the second quarter of 2010. Electric sales to industrial customers, including Noranda, declined 17% in 2009, compared with 2008. For several years, Amerens rate regulated utility businesses have been earning returns on investment that are well below their authorized levels, in part, due to regulatory lag. Ameren is focused on improving earnings to levels that represent fair returns on its rate regulated investments. Ameren has rate cases pending in both its Illinois and Missouri jurisdictions. Ameren is seeking revenue levels that reflect the significant investments it has made in electric and gas utility infrastructure to improve reliability. Ameren is also seeking recovery of higher financing costs and, in Missouri, rising net fuel costs. The Ameren Illinois Utilities are currently requesting a $130 million aggregate annual increase in base electric and natural gas delivery rates. The staff of the ICC currently supports a $46 million annual revenue increase. The staffs lower revenue amount reflects its lower recommended return on equity of 10.1% compared to the Ameren Illinois Utilities request of 11.5%, on a rate base weighted basis, and use of a lower pension and benefits expense level, among other things. In February 2010, administrative law judges issued a consolidated proposed order, which included a recommended revenue increase for electric delivery service for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of $66 million in the aggregate (CIPS $26 million increase, CILCO $6 million increase, and IP $34 million increase) and a recommended revenue net decrease for natural gas delivery service of $10 million in the aggregate (CIPS $1 million increase, CILCO $6 million decrease, and IP $5 million decrease). The ICC is not bound by the proposed order issued by the administrative law judges. New rates should be effective by early May 2010. UE filed a request with the MoPSC in July 2009 for an annual electric service rate increase of $402 million. More than half of the request was for anticipated higher net fuel costs. These increased net fuel costs would have been eligible for recovery through the FAC absent this filing. The MoPSC staff, in its direct testimony in the rate case, recommended an annual electric service rate increase of $218 million to $251 million, with approximately $214 million of this related to higher net fuel costs. The staffs lower revenue amount reflects its lower recommended return on equity range of 9.0% to 9.7%, which was lower than UEs initial request of 11.5%. The staffs revenue amount also incorporated lower depreciation, plant maintenance and financing cost levels, as well as other adjustments. The staff testimony reflects continuation of the FAC and the pension and postretirement benefit cost trackers and a modified environmental cost recovery mechanism. Other parties filed testimony in the rate case, including a group of large industrial customers and the Office of Public Counsel. The Missouri Office of Public Counsel recommended a return on equity of 10.2%. The large industrial customers recommended a rate increase of $139 million, which included a $181 million increase related to net fuel costs. Their lower revenue requirement reflects their lower recommended return on equity of 10%, the use of significantly lower depreciation rates and plant maintenance expenses, as well as lower financing costs, among other things. The large industrial customers testimony reflects continuation of the FAC, as well as a modified approach for the accounting and recovery of environmental costs. In February 2010, UE filed its rebuttal testimony in this rate case, which included, among other things, a modification of its recommended return on equity to 10.8%. It is anticipated that certain major changes to revenues, expenses, rate base, and capital structure will be trued up through January 31, 2010, in a March 2010 UE update. A MoPSC order is expected by late May 2010 with new rates expected to be effective in late June 2010. Current lower power prices are very much linked to weak economic conditions. Weak economic conditions have reduced the demand for power and other energy commodities. Ameren believes that when the economy recovers, these prices should rise. In the meantime, Ameren continues to look for opportunities to prudently reduce operating and capital spending in the Merchant Generation business, as well as protect and enhance margins. Amerens Merchant Generation business output is significantly hedged over the next few years. Such hedging protects credit quality and reduces earnings and cash flow volatility. In addition, Ameren continues to focus on providing value added electricity products to the market. 29 Table of Contents Leveraging Amerens competitive merchant generating assets, Marketing Company has a track record of enhancing margins through sales to wholesale and retail customers. To strengthen Merchant Generations ability to successfully weather current lower power prices, Ameren has reduced planned operating and capital spending, improving the cash flow outlook for the Merchant Generation business. Ameren continues to evaluate Merchant Generations spending plans in light of changing technologies, power prices and delivered fuel costs in order to ensure that the lowest cost options are identified in terms of both capital and ongoing operating costs. Earnings Ameren reported net income of $612 million, or $2.78 per share, for 2009 compared with net income of $605 million, or $2.88 per share, in 2008. Factors contributing to the 10 cent decline in earnings per share in 2009 compared with 2008 included lower electricity and natural gas sales in Amerens rate regulated businesses and lower margins in its Merchant Generation business, as a result of weak economic conditions, milder 2009 weather and, in the Missouri Regulated business, the impact of reduced sales to Noranda. Higher depreciation and interest expense, the absence in 2009 of the benefit of a lump sum payment from a coal supplier for higher fuel costs in 2009 as a result of a premature mine closure and contract termination, and an increased average number of common shares outstanding also affected comparative results. Offsetting factors included new utility rates in Illinois and Missouri, favorable unrealized MTM activity on derivatives, and lower operations and maintenance expenses due, in part, to the absence of a refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant in 2009. Liquidity As a result of turmoil in the capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009, we sought to improve our liquidity position. We replaced and extended the expiration of our credit facilities and sought to reduce our reliance on borrowings from these credit facilities, increase cash balances and increase the equity content of our capitalization. We also sought to eliminate debt at CILCORP as a step in simplifying our organizational structure. In addition, Ameren also reduced planned spending, headcount and capital investment across the company to mitigate the negative impact on sales of a weak economy and related power prices. At December 31, 2009, Ameren, on a consolidated basis, had available liquidity, in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under its existing credit facilities, of approximately $1.9 billion, which was $0.6 billion more than it had at the end of 2008. Cash flows from operations of $2.0 billion in 2009 at Ameren, along with other funds, were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of $338 million and to fund capital expenditures of $1.7 billion. Capital Spending During 2009, Ameren was able to significantly defer or reduce planned capital spending, including spending for environmental compliance, compared with previous plans. Between 2010 and 2017, Ameren expects that certain Ameren Companies will be required to make cumulative investments of between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion to retrofit their coal fired power plants with pollution control equipment in compliance with existing emissions related environmental laws and regulations. Any pollution control investments will result in decreased plant availability during construction and higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately 20% of this investment is expected to be in Amerens Missouri Regulated operations, and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers, but subject to prudency reviews. Initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to address global climate change are subject to active consideration in the U.S. Congress. Although we cannot predict the date of enactment or the requirements of any future climate change legislation or regulations, we believe it is possible that some form of federal legislation or regulations to control emissions of greenhouse gases will become law during President Obamas administration. Potential impacts from the climate change legislation could vary depending upon proposed CO2 emission limits, the timing of implementation of those limits, the method of distributing allowances, the degree to which offsets are allowed and available, and provisions for cost containment measures. Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, which, in turn, could lead to increased liquidity needs and higher financing costs. Moreover, to the extent Ameren requests recovery of these costs through rates, its regulators might deny some or all of, or defer timely recovery of, these costs. Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force UE, Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI and other similarly situated electric power generators to close some coal fired facilities, and it could lead to possible impairment of assets and reduced revenues. As a result, mandatory limits could have a material adverse impact on Amerens, UEs, Gencos, CILCOs (through AERG) and EEIs results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. General Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company under PUHCA 2005, administered by FERC. Amerens primary assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries. Amerens subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. These subsidiaries operate, as the case may be, rate regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution businesses, rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution businesses, and merchant electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Amerens common stock and the payment of other expenses by Ameren depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed description of our principal subsidiaries. UE operates a rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution business, and a rate 30 Table of Contents regulated natural gas transmission and distribution business in Missouri. CIPS operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. Genco operates a merchant electric generation business in Illinois and Missouri. CILCO operates a rate regulated electric transmission and distribution business, a merchant electric generation business (through its subsidiary, AERG), and a rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution business, all in Illinois. IP operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are expressed in millions, unless otherwise indicated. In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, we present certain information in cents per share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect Amerens earnings. We believe this per share information helps readers to understand the impact of these factors on Amerens earnings per share. All references in this report to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares outstanding during the applicable year. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Summary Our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations: winter heating and summer cooling demands. The vast majority of Amerens revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. This regulation has a material impact on the price we charge for our services. Merchant Generation sales are also subject to market conditions for power. We principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil for fuel in our operations. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the global economic and political environment, weather, supply and demand, and many other factors. We have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois and Missouri gas delivery service businesses, purchased power cost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois electric delivery service businesses, and a FAC for our Missouri electric utility business. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, for a discussion of pending rate cases in Missouri and Illinois, including UEs request for approval to implement an environmental cost recovery mechanism and to continue its FAC. Fluctuations in interest rates and conditions in the capital and credit markets affect our cost of borrowing and our pension and postretirement benefits costs. We employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risk and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of our power plants and transmission and distribution systems and the level of purchased power costs, operating and administrative costs, and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation was $612 million, or $2.78 per share, for 2009, $605 million, or $2.88 per share for 2008, and $618 million, or $2.98 per share, for 2007. Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation increased $7 million and its earnings per share decreased 10 cents in 2009 compared with 2008. Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation increased in the Illinois Regulated and Missouri Regulated segments by $92 million and $25 million, respectively, in 2009 compared with 2008, while net income attributable to Ameren Corporation in the Merchant Generation segment decreased by $105 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Compared with 2008 earnings, 2009 earnings were negatively affected by: higher dilution and financing costs (31 cents per share); the impact on electric and natural gas margins in our rate regulated businesses of higher net fuel costs at UE and lower demand (exclusive of weather impacts), among other things (30 cents per share); the absence in 2009 of the benefit of a settlement agreement reached with a coal mine owner that reimbursed Genco, in the form of a lump sum payment, for increased costs for coal and transportation incurred in 2008 and 2009 due to the premature closure of an Illinois mine and contract termination (18 cents per share); the impact of milder weather conditions on energy demand (estimated at 15 cents per share); increased depreciation and amortization expenses (12 cents per share); reduced sales to Noranda because of an extended storm related outage (11 cents per share); the absence in 2009 of a MoPSC rate order establishing two separate regulatory assets for previously incurred storm and MISO related costs (11 cents per share); increased expense related to work force reductions through voluntary and involuntary separation programs and asset impairment charges recorded primarily at Genco in 2009 (7 cents per share); increased taxes other than income taxes, primarily because of higher property taxes (6 cents per share); lower realized electric margins in the Merchant Generation segment largely due to lower sales volumes and higher fuel and related transportation costs (5 cents per share); and increased distribution system reliability expenditures (5 cents per share). Compared with 2008 earnings, 2009 earnings were favorably affected by: higher electric and natural gas delivery service rates, effective October 1, 2008, in the Illinois Regulated segment pursuant to an ICC consolidated rate order for 31 Table of Contents CIPS, CILCO and IP (40 cents per share); higher electric rates, effective March 1, 2009, in the Missouri Regulated segment pursuant to a MoPSC rate order (40 cents per share); favorable net unrealized MTM activity on derivatives and from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans (21 cents per share); decreased plant operations and maintenance expense (15 cents per share); the absence in 2009 of a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage (9 cents per share); the absence in 2009 of asset impairment charges recorded to adjust the carrying value of CILCOs (through AERG) Indian Trails and Sterling Avenue generating facilities to their estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008 (6 cents per share); and the reduced impact in 2009 of the electric rate relief and customer assistance programs provided to certain Ameren Illinois Utilities electric customers under the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement (5 cents per share). The cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2008. Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation decreased $13 million and its earnings per share decreased 10 cents in 2008 compared with 2007. Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation increased in the Merchant Generation segment by $71 million in 2008 compared with 2007, while net income attributable to Ameren Corporation in the Missouri Regulated and Illinois Regulated segments decreased by $47 million and $15 million, respectively. Other net income decreased $22 million in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily because of net unrealized MTM losses on nonqualifying hedges mainly related to fuel related transactions and reduced interest and dividend income. Compared with 2007 earnings, 2008 earnings were negatively affected by: higher fuel and related transportation prices, excluding net MTM losses on fuel related transactions (27 cents per share); increased distribution system reliability expenditures (16 cents per share); higher plant operations and maintenance expenses (16 cents per share); the impact of unfavorable milder weather conditions on energy demand (estimated at 16 cents per share); net unrealized MTM losses on nonqualifying hedges (11 cents per share); higher dilution and financing costs (10 cents per share); asset impairment charges recorded to adjust the carrying value of CILCOs (through AERG) Indian Trails and Sterling Avenue generation facilities to their estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008 (6 cents per share); increased depreciation and amortization expenses (6 cents per share); the absence in 2008 of the reversal, recorded in 2007, of the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan accrual (5 cents per share); higher labor and employee benefit costs (5 cents per share); and higher bad debt expenses (3 cents per share). Compared with 2007 earnings, 2008 earnings were favorably affected by: higher realized electric margins in the Merchant Generation segment; the absence in 2008 of costs that were incurred in January 2007 associated with electric outages caused by severe ice storms, and the amount of these costs that UE will recover as a result of an accounting order issued by the MoPSC, which was recorded as a regulatory asset in 2008 (16 cents per share); the reduced impact in 2008 of the electric rate relief and customer assistance programs provided to certain Ameren Illinois Utilities electric customers under the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement (13 cents per share); the absence in 2008 of a March 2007 FERC order that resettled costs among MISO market participants retroactive to 2005 that was recorded in 2007, and the subsequent recovery of a portion of these costs in 2008, through a MoPSC order (10 cents per share); higher electric and natural gas delivery service rates in the Illinois Regulated segment pursuant to the ICC consolidated rate order for CIPS, CILCO, and IP issued in September 2008 (9 cents per share); the benefit of a settlement agreement with a coal mine owner reached in June 2008 that reimbursed Genco, in the form of a lump sum payment, for increased costs for coal and transportation that it expected to incur in 2009 due to the premature closure of an Illinois mine and contract termination (8 cents per share); higher electric rates, lower depreciation expense, and decreased income tax expense in the Missouri Regulated segment pursuant to the MoPSC electric rate order for UE issued in May 2007 (8 cents per share); and the reduced impact of the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2008, as compared with the prior year refueling and maintenance outage (4 cents per share). The cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2007. 32 Table of Contents Because it is a holding company, Amerens net income and cash flows are primarily generated by its principal subsidiaries: UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP.

Electric margins are defined as electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. Natural gas margins are defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale. The table covers the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. We consider electric and natural gas margins useful measures to analyze the change in profitability of our electric and natural gas operations between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information we provide in accordance with GAAP. However, these margins may not be a presentation defined under GAAP, and they may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we provide elsewhere in this report. 2009 versus 2008 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCO IP Electric revenue change: Effect of weather (estimate) $ (47 ) $ (33 ) $ (3 ) $ $ (4 ) $ (7 ) Regulated rates: Changes in base rates 229 141 17 (2 ) 73 Noranda sales (50 ) (50 ) Illinois pass through power supply costs (338 ) (89 ) (104 ) (145 ) Sales price changes, including hedge effect 115 136 60 Off system revenues (89 ) (89 ) 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, net of reimbursement 15 2 7 4 2 Supply Cost Adjustment factor 7 2 1 4 Net unrealized MTM losses (110 ) Generation output, load and other (190 ) (25 ) (7 ) (201 ) 3 (6 ) Total electric revenue change $ (458 ) $ (56 ) $ (78 ) $ (58 ) $ (42 ) $ (79 ) Fuel and purchased power change: Fuel: Generation and other $ 126 $ 21 $ $ 79 $ 2 $ Net unrealized MTM gains 118 58 33 7 Price (83 ) (46 ) (3 ) Coal contract settlement (27 ) (27 ) Purchased power (25 ) 48 18 Illinois pass through power supply costs 338 89 104 145 FERC ordered MISO resettlements (12 ) (12 ) Total fuel and purchased power change $ 435 $ 115 $ 89 $ 39 $ 128 $ 145 Net change in electric margins $ (23 ) $ 59 $ 11 $ (19 ) $ 86 $ 66 Natural gas margins change: Effect of weather (estimate) $ (7 ) $ (1 ) $ (1 ) $ $ (1 ) $ (4 ) Changes in base rates 34 7 (6 ) 33 Absence of capitalization of nonrecoverable gas costs (5 ) (1 ) (4 ) Net unrealized 2008 MTM losses 12 12 Other (17 ) (4 ) (4 ) (8 ) (2 ) Net change in natural gas margins $ 17 $ (5 ) $ 1 $ $ (3 ) $ 23 34 Table of Contents 2008 versus 2007 Ameren(a) UE CIPS Genco CILCO IP Electric revenue change: Effect of weather (estimate) $ (59 ) $ (36 ) $ (6 ) $ $ (4 ) $ (13 ) Regulated rates: Changes in base rates 43 16 5 22 Illinois pass through power supply costs (91 ) (58 ) 15 (48 ) Sales price changes, including hedge effect 106 45 18 Off system revenues, excluding estimated weather impact of $53 million (42 ) (47 ) 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, net of reimbursement 35 6 13 9 7 FERC ordered MISO resettlements (17 ) (12 ) (4 ) Supply Cost Adjustment factor (2 ) (2 ) 5 (5 ) Net unrealized MTM gains 81 8 Generation output, load and other 30 29 3 (14 ) 51 4 Total electric revenue change $ 84 $ (30 ) $ (52 ) $ 32 $ 90 $ (33 ) Fuel and purchased power change: Fuel: Generation and other $ 33 $ 31 $ $ 31 $ (32 ) $ Net unrealized MTM losses (75 ) (39 ) (18 ) (3 ) Price (93 ) (56 ) (13 ) (15 ) Coal contract settlement for 2009 27 27 Purchased power 39 9 23 Illinois pass through power supply costs 91 58 (15 ) 48 FERC ordered MISO resettlements 47 23 8 4 12 Total fuel and purchased power change $ 69 $ (32 ) $ 66 $ 50 $ (61 ) $ 60 Net change in electric margins $ 153 $ (62 ) $ 14 $ 82 $ 29 $ 27 Natural gas margins change: Effect of weather (estimate) $ 12 $ 2 $ 2 $ $ 2 $ 6 Changes in base rates 7 3 1 (5 ) 8 Capitalization of nonrecoverable gas costs 9 2 7 Net unrealized MTM losses (6 ) (6 ) Other 14 3 2 8 (3 ) Net change in natural gas margins $ 36 $ 8 $ 7 $ $ (1 ) $ 18 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Amerens electric margins decreased by $23 million, or 1%, in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Amerens electric margins: Higher net fuel expense at UE of $20 million resulting from lower off system revenues ($89 million), offset, in part, by lower fuel generation and other ($21 million) and purchased power ($48 million). Net unrealized MTM activity in the Merchant Generation segment of $110 million (Marketing Company net loss of $112 million and EEI net gain of $2 million) on energy transactions, primarily related to nonqualifying hedges of changes in market prices for electricity. Higher fuel expense at Genco as a result of its June 2008 settlement agreement with a coal mine owner to receive a lump sum payment of $60 million for the early termination of a coal supply contract. This payment compensated Genco, in total, for higher fuel costs it incurred throughout 2008 ($33 million) and 2009 ($27 million). Because the entire settlement was recorded in earnings in 2008, Amerens earnings in 2009 were comparatively lower than they otherwise would have been. Excluding the impact of the June 2008 settlement agreement, 5% higher fuel prices in the Merchant Generation segment. Reduced sales by UE to Noranda, due to an extended severe storm related outage, which lowered electric revenues by $50 million in 2009. See Outlook for additional information on the Noranda plant outage. Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 7% reduction in cooling degree days, which decreased margins by $43 million. Excluding the impact of UEs reduced sales to Noranda, lower weather normalized end use retail sales volume of 4% in Amerens rate regulated utilities, largely a result of the economic slowdown, which decreased margins by $23 million. Decreased power plant utilization in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily because of lower market prices, which resulted in fewer opportunities for economic sales, and transmission congestion, which limited the period when power could be sold. Merchant Generations baseload, coal fired generating plants equivalent availability factors were 81% in 2009, 35 Table of Contents compared with 85% in 2008, and the average capacity factor was 66% in 2009, compared with 76% in 2008. The following items had a favorable impact on Amerens electric margins for 2009 compared with 2008: Higher electric rates at UE, effective March 1, 2009, which increased margins by $141 million, and at the Ameren Illinois Utilities, effective October 1, 2008, which increased margins by $88 million. Net unrealized MTM activity at UE of $58 million on energy and fuel related transactions. During 2009 UE reversed and deferred as regulatory assets previously recorded net MTM losses of $42 million on energy and fuel related transactions in the first quarter of 2009, when these costs became probable of recovery because of the FAC. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for additional information. Net unrealized MTM activity at the Merchant Generation segment of $55 million (Genco $33 million, CILCO $7 million, EEI $15 million) on fuel related transactions. These were primarily associated with financial instruments that were acquired to mitigate the risk of rising diesel fuel price adjustments embedded in coal transportation contracts. The repricing of wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements and financial swaps that settled at higher margins at Merchant Generation.

In addition to these items, storm repair expenditures were higher in 2009 as a result of a severe ice storm at the beginning of the year. Illinois Regulated Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $77 million in the Illinois Regulated segment, as discussed below. CIPS Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $15 million, primarily because of a $10 million reduction in bad debt expense, because of elevated levels of bad debt expense in 2008 and the impact of the Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism (net of a related donation for customer assistance programs), and a favorable change in unrealized net MTM adjustments between periods resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $63 million, primarily because of higher labor and employee benefit costs. These increases were primarily a result of work performed on behalf of CIPS and IP as discussed below. 42 Table of Contents At the beginning of 2009, approximately 570 employees were transferred from Ameren Services to CILCO (Illinois Regulated), which resulted in an increase in other operations and maintenance expenses at CILCO (Illinois Regulated) in 2009. These CILCO (Illinois Regulated) employees also provide support services to CIPS and IP. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) records reimbursements from CIPS and IP for work performed by its employees on their behalf as Operating Revenues Support Services Affiliates on its statement of income, which increased $70 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Intercompany revenue and expenses associated with these transactions are eliminated in consolidation within the Illinois Regulated segment. See Note 14 Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on CILCO (Illinois Regulated) support services. Reducing the unfavorable effect of the above items was a reduction in bad debt expense, because of elevated levels of bad debt expense in 2008 and the impact of the Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism (net of a related donation for customer assistance programs). IP IPs other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $43 million, primarily because of a $25 million reduction in bad debt expense, because of elevated levels of bad debt expense in 2008 and the impact of the Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism (net of a related donation for customer assistance programs), a $6 million decrease in distribution system reliability expenditures, including reduced storm costs, and a favorable change in unrealized net MTM adjustments between periods, resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans. Merchant Generation Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $16 million in the Merchant Generation segment, as discussed below. Genco Gencos other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between years as employee severance costs and expenses recognized for the termination of a rail line extension project were reduced by lower plant maintenance costs. CILCO (AERG) Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $22 million, primarily because of a $9 million reduction in plant maintenance costs and an $11 million reduction in asset impairment charges between years. EEI EEIs other operations and maintenance expenses increased $10 million, primarily because of higher plant maintenance costs. 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Amerens other operations and maintenance expenses increased $170 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Labor costs increased by $52 million and plant maintenance expenditures at coal fired plants were higher by $43 million due to outages. A $30 million increase in distribution system reliability expenditures and a $10 million increase in information technology costs also resulted in higher expenses. An unfavorable change of $22 million in unrealized net MTM adjustments resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans reduced expenses between years. Bad debt expense increased by $10 million, primarily because of the transition to higher market based rates at the Ameren Illinois Utilities. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2007, a $15 million accrual established in 2006 for contributions to assist customers through the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan was reversed because the plan was terminated. There was no similar item in 2008. Other operations and maintenance expenses also increased in 2008 by $14 million, because of asset impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 to adjust the carrying value of CILCOs (through AERG) Indian Trails and Sterling Avenue generation facilities to their estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008. CILCO recorded an asset impairment charge of $12 million related to the Indian Trails cogeneration facility as a result of the suspension of operations by the facilitys only customer. CILCORP recorded a $2 million impairment charge related to the Sterling Avenue CT based on the expected net proceeds to be generated from the sale of the facility in 2009. Because most of the Sterling Avenue asset carrying value was recorded at CILCORP, as a result of adjustments made during purchase accounting, the write down of the carrying value of the Sterling Avenue CT did not result in an impairment loss at CILCO (AERG). Reducing the unfavorable effect of these items was a reduction of $10 million in employee benefit costs, due to changes in actuarial estimates, and an $18 million decrease in storm expenditures, primarily in UEs service territory. Additionally, costs associated with the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2008 were $5 million lower than those for the refueling in 2007. Other operations and maintenance expenses were further reduced in 2008 by the MoPSC accounting order related to 2007 storms, as discussed above. Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses in Amerens and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated (UE) UEs other operations and maintenance expenses were higher by $22 million, primarily because of a $37 million increase in labor costs and a $29 million increase in plant maintenance expenditures at coal fired plants. An unfavorable 43 Table of Contents change in unrealized net MTM adjustments resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans and a $16 million increase in distribution system reliability expenditures also resulted in incremental expenses. Reducing the impact of these items were the effect of the MoPSC accounting order discussed above, a decrease in injuries and damages expenses between years, and the reduced impact of the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2008 compared with the refueling in 2007. Storm repair expenditures also decreased by $31 million, further reducing other operations and maintenance expenses. Illinois Regulated Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $77 million in the Illinois Regulated segment, as discussed below. CIPS Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $24 million. The increase was primarily because of an $11 million increase in distribution system reliability expenditures, including storm costs, along with increased labor costs and bad debt expense. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2007, CIPS reversed an accrual of $4 million established in 2006 for contributions to assist customers through the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan. There was no similar item in 2008. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Other operations and maintenance expenses were higher by $8 million, primarily because of a $5 million increase in storm costs in 2008. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2007, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) reversed an accrual of $3 million established in 2006 for the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan contributions. There was no similar item in 2008. Lower employee benefit costs reduced the effect of these unfavorable items. IP Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $47 million, due, in part, to a $17 million increase in distribution system reliability expenditures, including storm costs. Labor costs and bad debt expense increased by $6 million each, and unrealized net MTM adjustments resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans also increased other operations and maintenance expenses between years. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2007, IP reversed an $8 million accrual established in 2006 for the Illinois Customer Elect electric rate increase phase in plan contributions. There was no similar item in 2008. Reducing the unfavorable effect of these items was a reduction in employee benefit costs. Merchant Generation Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $43 million in the Merchant Generation segment, as discussed below. Genco Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $12 million at Genco. Plant maintenance costs were higher by $9 million, due to scheduled outages, and labor costs increased by $5 million. Genco paid $3 million to the IPA in 2007 as part of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement. There was no similar item in 2008. CILCO (AERG) Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $25 million at CILCO (AERG), primarily because of a $12 million impairment charge recorded in 2008 related to the Indian Trails cogeneration plant discussed above. Plant maintenance costs increased by $7 million, due to scheduled outages, and labor costs increased by $3 million. CILCO (AERG) paid $1.5 million to the IPA in 2007 as part of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement. There was no similar item in 2008. EEI Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable in 2008 and 2007. Depreciation and Amortization 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased $40 million in 2009, as compared with 2008, because of items noted below at the Ameren Companies. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses in Amerens and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2009 and 2008 were as follows. Missouri Regulated (UE) Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $28 million, primarily because of capital additions and amortization of regulatory assets that resulted from UEs electric rate case in 2009. Illinois Regulated Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between years in the Illinois Regulated segment. As part of the consolidated electric and natural gas rate order issued by the ICC in September 2008, the ICC changed plant asset useful lives, effective October 1, 2008. This resulted in reductions in depreciation expense at CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and an increase in depreciation expense at IP. Capital additions partially offset the benefit of the rate order at CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and further 44 Table of Contents increased depreciation and amortization expenses at IP. The net effect of the above items was an $18 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expenses at CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and a $14 million increase at IP. Depreciation and amortization expenses at CIPS were comparable between years. Merchant Generation Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $17 million in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily because of capital additions at CILCO (AERG) and $3 million of expense recorded by Genco in the third quarter of 2009 for the retirement of two generation units at its Meredosia power plant. Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable at EEI between years. 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between periods. Increases in depreciation expense, resulting from capital additions in 2008, were mitigated by a reduction in expense because of changes in the useful lives of plant assets resulting from rate orders in 2007 in Missouri and 2008 in Illinois, as discussed below. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses in Amerens and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated (UE) Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $4 million, primarily because of the extension of UEs nuclear and coal fired plants useful lives for purposes of calculating depreciation expense in conjunction with a MoPSC electric rate order effective June 2007. Reducing the benefit of this item was an increase in capital additions in 2008. Illinois Regulated Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable in 2008 and 2007 in the Illinois Regulated segment. The effect of the consolidated electric and natural gas rate order issued by the ICC in 2008, as noted above, resulted in reductions in depreciation expense at CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and an increase in depreciation expense at IP. Capital additions partially offset the benefit of the rate order at CIPS and CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and further increased depreciation and amortization expenses at IP. Merchant Generation Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $4 million in the Merchant Generation segment. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $8 million at CILCO (AERG) because of capital additions in 2008. Gencos depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $4 million, primarily because of extended useful lives resulting from a depreciation study completed in September 2007, partially mitigated by capital additions. EEIs depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between years. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Amerens taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, primarily because of higher property and payroll taxes. Variations in taxes other than income taxes in Amerens and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2009 and 2008 were as follows. Missouri Regulated (UE) Taxes other than income taxes increased $17 million, primarily because of higher property taxes. Illinois Regulated Taxes other than income taxes were comparable in 2009 and 2008 in the Illinois Regulated segment and at CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and IP. Merchant Generation Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between years in the Merchant Generation segment and at Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI. 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Amerens taxes other than income taxes increased $12 million, primarily because of higher property taxes and higher gross receipts taxes. Increases in property taxes were reduced by invested capital electricity distribution tax credits in the Illinois Regulated segment. These credits were related to payments made in a previous year. Variations in taxes other than income taxes in Amerens and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated (UE) UEs taxes other than income taxes increased $6 million, primarily because of higher property taxes. Illinois Regulated Taxes other than income taxes increased $5 million in the Illinois Regulated segment, primarily because of higher excise taxes at CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated), and IP. Property taxes were comparable between years as increases in 2008 were mitigated by the favorable impact of the invested capital electricity distribution tax credits discussed above. 45 Table of Contents Merchant Generation Taxes other than income taxes were comparable in 2008 and 2007 in the Merchant Generation segment and for Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI. Other Income and Expenses 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Other income and expenses were comparable in 2009 and 2008. Miscellaneous expenses decreased as expenses associated with energy efficiency and customer assistance programs under the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement were lower in 2009. However, miscellaneous income declined because of reduced interest income, partially offset by increased allowance for funds used during construction. Variations in other income and expenses in Amerens and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2009 and 2008 were as follows. Missouri Regulated (UE) Other income and expenses were comparable between periods. Illinois Regulated Other income and expenses decreased $9 million in the Illinois Regulated segment, and decreased at both CIPS and IP, primarily because of lower interest income. Decreased expenses associated with energy efficiency and customer assistance programs under the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement mitigated this decrease. Other income and expenses at CILCO (Illinois Regulated) were comparable in 2009 and 2008. Merchant Generation Other income and expenses were comparable between years in the Merchant Generation segment and at Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI. 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Other income and expenses were comparable in 2008 and 2007. Miscellaneous income increased $5 million, primarily because of an increase at UE in allowance for funds used during construction, reduced by lower interest income. Miscellaneous expense increased $6 million, primarily because of increased expenses associated with contributions to social programs. Variations in other income and expenses in Amerens and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated (UE) Miscellaneous income increased $24 million, primarily because of an increase in allowance for funds used during construction. This increase resulted from higher rates and increased construction work in progress balances. Miscellaneous expense was comparable between years. Illinois Regulated Other income and expenses decreased $9 million in the Illinois Regulated segment and at CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP, primarily because of lower interest income. Merchant Generation Other income and expenses in the Merchant Generation segment and at Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI were comparable in 2008 and 2007. Interest Charges 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Amerens interest charges increased $68 million because of items noted below at the Ameren Companies and because of the issuance of $425 million of senior notes at Ameren in May 2009. Variations in interest charges in Amerens and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2009 and 2008 were as follows. Missouri Regulated (UE) Interest charges increased $36 million, primarily because of the issuance of $350 million, $450 million, and $250 million of senior secured notes in March 2009, June 2008, and April 2008, respectively. The amortization of fees related to new credit facilities entered into in the second quarter of 2009 also increased interest charges. The majority of the fees related to the new credit facilities are being amortized over a two year period. Additionally, a reversal in interest charges previously accrued on uncertain tax positions due to favorable income tax settlements in 2008, with no similar item in 2009, had a negative impact on 2009. The maturity of $148 million of first mortgage bonds in May 2008 and refinancing of auction rate environmental improvement revenue bonds in 2008, along with a reduction of short term borrowings, mitigated the impact of the above items. Illinois Regulated Interest charges increased $9 million in the Illinois Regulated segment because of the amortization of fees related to a new credit facility entered into in the second quarter of 2009 and as a result of matters as discussed below. CIPS Interest charges were comparable in 2009 and 2008. 46 Table of Contents CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Interest charges increased $8 million, primarily because of the issuance of senior secured notes of $150 million in December 2008 at a higher rate than the short term borrowings it refinanced. IP Interest charges were comparable between years. Increased interest charges resulting from the issuance of senior secured notes of $400 million and $337 million in October 2008 and April 2008, respectively, was mitigated as the proceeds of these issuances were used to refinance auction rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds, which bore default rates ranging from 12% to 18%, and to reduce short term borrowings. Merchant Generation Interest charges increased $20 million in the Merchant Generation segment, because of items discussed below. Additionally, CILCORP parent company recorded amortization of fees related to new credit facilities entered into in the second quarter of 2009 and had increased intercompany borrowings. Genco Interest charges increased $4 million, primarily because of the issuance of $300 million of senior unsecured notes in April 2008. CILCO (AERG) Interest charges increased $12 million, primarily because of increased intercompany borrowings. EEI Interest charges were comparable between years. 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Interest charges increased $17 million. Long term debt issuances, net of maturities and redemptions, and the cost of refinancing auction rate environmental improvement and pollution control revenue refunding bonds resulted in increased interest expense in 2008. These increases were reduced by income tax settlements in 2008. Variations in interest charges in Amerens and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated (UE) Interest charges were comparable between periods. Interest charges associated with the issuance of senior secured notes of $450 million, $250 million, and $425 million in June 2008, April 2008, and June 2007, respectively, was mitigated by a reduction in short term borrowings, which were reduced with proceeds from the senior secured notes financings. The proceeds from these senior secured notes financings were also used to refinance auction rate environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds, and to fund the maturity of $148 million of first mortgage bonds, and to reduce short term borrowings. Additionally, interest charges were reduced by $8 million because of a reversal of interest charges previously accrued on uncertain tax positions as a result of income tax settlements in 2008. Illinois Regulated Interest charges increased $12 million in the Illinois Regulated segment, as discussed below. CIPS Interest charges decreased $7 million, primarily because of reduced short term borrowings and a $3 million reduction from a reversal of interest charges previously accrued on uncertain tax positions as a result of an income tax settlement. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) Interest charges were comparable in 2008 and 2007. IP Interest charges increased $22 million, primarily because of the issuance of $400 million, $337 million, and $250 million of senior secured notes at IP in October 2008, April 2008, and November 2007, respectively. The $337 million senior secured notes were issued to refinance auction rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds, while proceeds from the other debt issuances were used to reduce short term borrowings. Merchant Generation Interest charges decreased $8 million in the Merchant Generation segment, as discussed below. Genco Interest charges were comparable between periods. Increased interest charges resulting from the issuance of $300 million of senior unsecured notes in April 2008 was mitigated by a corresponding reduction in short term borrowings. Additionally, interest charges were reduced by $3 million as a result of an income tax settlement. CILCO (AERG) Interest charges decreased $4 million at CILCO (AERG), primarily because of reduced short term borrowings. EEI Interest charges were comparable in 2008 and 2007. 47 Table of Contents Income Taxes The following table presents effective income tax rates by segment for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007: 2009 2008 2007 Ameren 35 % 34 % 34 % Missouri Regulated 33 36 33 Illinois Regulated 37 30 32 Merchant Generation 38 36 37 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Amerens effective tax rate in 2009 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2008 due to variations discussed below. Variations in effective tax rates for Amerens and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2009 and 2008 were as follows. Missouri Regulated (UE) UEs effective tax rate was lower, primarily because of higher favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities, partially mitigated by changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions. Illinois Regulated The effective tax rate was higher in the Illinois Regulated segment because of items detailed below. CIPS The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of the decreased impact of net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities, investment tax credit amortization, and permanent items on higher pretax book income. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) The effective tax rate was higher, primarily because of the decreased impact of permanent benefits, net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities, and investment tax credit amortization on higher pretax book income. IP The effective tax rate decreased, primarily because of the impact of permanent items on higher pretax book income, along with changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions. Merchant Generation The effective tax rate was higher in the Merchant Generation segment because of items detailed below. Genco The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of the decreased impact of Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions, along with changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions. CILCO (AERG) The effective tax rate was lower, primarily because of the increased impact of Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions, along with changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions. 2008 versus 2007 Ameren Amerens effective tax rate was comparable in 2008 and 2007. Favorable impacts of state audit settlements and changes in state apportionment were offset by unfavorable permanent items related to company owned life insurance as well as other variations discussed below at the Ameren Companies. Variations in effective tax rates for Amerens and CILCOs business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2008 and 2007 were as follows. Missouri Regulated (UE) The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of lower favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities, along with decreased Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions in 2008. Illinois Regulated The effective tax rate decreased in the Illinois Regulated segment because of items detailed below. CIPS The effective tax rate was lower, primarily because of the impact of net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities and permanent items on lower pretax income in 2008. CILCO (Illinois Regulated) The effective tax rate was higher, primarily because of lower tax credits, lower favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities, and lower favorable permanent benefits related to company owned life insurance. IP The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of lower favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities, lower tax credits, and the impact of other permanent items as well as increased reserves for uncertain tax positions on lower pretax book income in 2008. 48 Table of Contents Merchant Generation The effective tax rate decreased in the Merchant Generation segment because of items detailed below. Genco The effective tax rate was lower, primarily because of the increased impact of Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions and research tax credits. CILCO (AERG) The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of the impact of Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The tariff based gross margins of Amerens rate regulated utility operating companies (UE, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP) continue to be a principal source of cash from operating activities for Ameren and its rate regulated subsidiaries. A diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate regulated residential, commercial, and industrial classes and a commodity mix of natural gas and electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows for Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO (Illinois Regulated) and IP. For operating cash flows, Genco and AERG rely on power sales to Marketing Company, which sold power through financial contracts that were part of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement and various power procurement processes in the non rate regulated Illinois market. Marketing Company also sells power through other primarily market based contracts with wholesale and retail customers. In addition to cash flows from operating activities, the Ameren Companies use available cash, credit facilities, money pool, or other short term borrowings from affiliates to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements. The use of operating cash flows and credit facility or short term borrowings to fund capital expenditures and other investments may periodically result in a working capital deficit, as was the case at December 31, 2009, for Genco and CILCO. The Ameren Companies may reduce their credit facility or short term borrowings with cash from operations or discretionarily with long term borrowings, or in the case of Ameren subsidiaries, with equity infusions from Ameren. The Ameren Companies expect to incur significant capital expenditures over the next five years as they comply with environmental regulations and make significant investments in their electric and natural gas utility infrastructure to improve overall system reliability. Ameren intends to finance those capital expenditures and investments with a blend of equity and debt so that it maintains a capital structure in its rate regulated businesses, of approximately 50% to 55% equity. We plan to implement our long term financing plans for debt, equity, or equity linked securities in order to finance our operations appropriately, meet scheduled debt maturities, and maintain financial strength and flexibility. In 2008 and 2009, the global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility. See Outlook for a discussion of the implications of this volatility for our industry as a whole, including the Ameren Companies, and how we addressed these issues. The following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities Net Cash (Used In) Investing Activities Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Ameren(a) $ 1,977 $ 1,524 $ 1,108 $ (1,789) $ (2,097) $ (1,468) $ 342 $ 310 $ 578 UE 972 543 587 (955) (1,033) (700) 250 305 297 CIPS 191 101 14 (68) (57) (42) (95 ) (70 ) 48 Genco 232 246 255 (349) (330) (210) 121 84 (44 ) CILCO 263 207 74 (153) (317) (212) (22 ) 104 141 IP 409 178 30 (189) (246) (186) (80 ) 112 162 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. Cash Flows from Operating Activities 2009 versus 2008 Amerens cash from operating activities increased in 2009 compared with 2008. Operating activities associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident resulted in a $256 million increase in cash during 2009, compared with 2008. The 2009 increase was a result of a $65 million increase in insurance recoveries received as well as a $191 million reduction in cash payments compared with 2008. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information about the Taum Sauk property insurance settlement agreement with all but three of the property insurance carriers and the related settlement payment received during 2009. Other factors contributing to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included a $198 million decrease in the cost of natural gas purchased for inventories because of lower prices, a $97 million decrease, net of refunds, in income tax payments primarily at UE as discussed below, and an increase in electric costs over recovered from Illinois customers under cost recovery mechanisms. Additionally, as discussed in Results of Operations, less cash was used for operations and 49 Table of Contents maintenance activities because many plant related projects were either reduced, deferred, or cancelled as well as the absence of a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2009. Factors reducing the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included a $68 million increase in interest payments, a decrease in natural gas costs over recovered from customers under the PGA, a $35 million increase in pension and postretirement plan contributions, lower electric margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, including the absence in 2009 of the 2008 lump sum settlement payment received by Genco from a coal mine owner for the early termination of a coal supply contract, a $21 million decrease in customer advances for construction, $16 million of employee severance payments as a result of the 2009 voluntary and involuntary separation programs, an increase in annual incentive compensation payments, and an $8 million increase in cash payments for major storm restoration costs. UEs cash from operating activities increased in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase was primarily due to net income tax refunds of $208 million in 2009 compared with net income tax payments of $130 million in 2008, and a $256 million increase in cash from operating activities associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident, as discussed above. The significant change in income taxes is primarily a result of an acceleration of deductions due to economic stimulus legislation and a change in tax treatment of electric generation plant expenditures. Other factors contributing to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included a $20 million decrease in the cost of natural gas purchased for inventories because of lower prices, higher electric margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, and an increase in natural gas costs over recovered from customers under the PGA. Additionally, as discussed in Results of Operations, less cash was used for operations and maintenance activities, because several plant related projects were either reduced, deferred, or cancelled as well as the absence of a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2009. Factors reducing the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included the collection of an $85 million affiliate receivable in 2008 that did not occur in 2009, a $39 million increase in interest payments, a $16 million increase in pension and other postretirement plan contributions, a $10 million increase in energy efficiency expenditures for new customer programs, a $6 million increase in major storm restoration costs, and $6 million of employee severance payments as a result of the 2009 voluntary and involuntary separation programs. CIPS cash from operating activities increased in 2009 compared with 2008. Factors contributing to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included a $57 million net reduction in collateral posted with suppliers due in part to improved credit ratings, a $40 million decrease in the cost of natural gas purchased for inventories because of lower prices, higher electric and natural gas margins as discussed in Results of Operations, an increase in electric costs over recovered from customers under cost recovery mechanisms, and a $5 million decrease in interest payments. Additionally, more cash was collected in 2009 from receivables, because of colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with 2007. Factors reducing the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included net income tax payments of $24 million in 2009, compared with net income tax refunds of $21 million in 2008, a decrease in natural gas costs over recovered from customers under the PGA, and a $5 million increase in major storm restoration costs. Gencos cash from operating activities decreased in 2009 compared with 2008. Factors contributing to a decrease in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included lower electric margins as discussed in Results of Operations, including the 2008 lump sum settlement payment received from a coal mine owner as well as the absence of $7 million, net of premiums, of replacement power insurance recoveries received in 2008 from an affiliate as the policy was not renewed. Other factors contributing to the decrease in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included a $23 million increase in income tax payments, net of refunds, a $6 million increase in interest payments, and $4 million of employee severance payments as a result of the 2009 voluntary and involuntary separation programs. Factors offsetting the decrease in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included reduced coal purchases in 2009 as generation levels declined and a $10 million reduction in funding required by the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement. CILCOs cash from operating activities increased in 2009 compared with 2008. Factors contributing to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included higher electric margins as discussed in Results of Operations, a $58 million decrease in the cost of natural gas purchased for inventories because of lower prices, and a $45 million net reduction in collateral posted with suppliers due in part to improved credit ratings. Additionally, more cash was collected in 2009 from receivables, because of colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with 2007. Factors reducing the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included net income tax payments of $82 million in 2009, compared with net income tax refunds of $15 million in 2008, increased coal purchases to build inventories at the Duck Creek generating facility as a result of switching coal blends in 2009, a $6 million increase in pension and other postretirement plan contributions, a $6 million increase in interest payments, the absence of $5 million, net of premiums, of replacement power insurance recoveries received in 2008 from an affiliate as the policy was not renewed, a decrease in natural gas costs over recovered from customers under the PGA, and an increase in annual incentive compensation payments. IPs cash from operating activities increased in 2009 compared with 2008. Factors contributing to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included higher electric and natural gas margins as discussed in Results of Operations, an $80 million decrease in the cost of natural gas purchased for inventories because 50 Table of Contents of lower prices, a $74 million net decrease in collateral posted with suppliers due in part to improved credit ratings, an increase in electric costs over recovered from customers under cost recovery mechanisms, and a $3 million decrease in major storm restoration costs. Additionally, more cash was collected in 2009 from receivables, because of colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with 2007. Factors reducing the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008, included net income tax payments of $22 million in 2009, compared with net income tax refunds of $43 million in 2008, a decrease in natural gas cost over recovered from customers under the PGA, a $22 million increase in interest payments, and a $15 million reduction in customer advances for construction. 2008 versus 2007 Amerens cash from operating activities increased in 2008, compared to 2007, primarily because of higher electric and natural gas margins as discussed in Results of Operations, a $177 million decrease in income tax payments (net of refunds), and improved collections of receivables in 2008. The reduction in income tax payments was largely attributable to higher depreciation allowed for tax purposes. In 2007, receivables from the Ameren Illinois Utilities had increased due to the January 2, 2007, electric rate increases, related uncertainty surrounding a potential electric settlement agreement, and deterioration of collections. However, collections improved in 2008. Additionally, Ameren experienced an $87 million benefit to cash flows for 2008 as compared with 2007 because of the timing of cash receipts for MISO receivables. The 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement also had a positive effect on cash from operations in 2008 compared with 2007. Cash outflows in accordance with the settlement, net of reimbursements from generators, were $84 million less in 2008 than in 2007. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement. In addition, Amerens cash flows from operations increased in 2008 compared with 2007 because of a $40 million reduction in storm restoration costs, over recovery under the PGAs, and a $27 million payment received by Genco in 2008 as part of a coal contract settlement for increased costs for coal and transportation that Genco expected to incur in 2009 because of the premature closure of an Illinois mine at the end of 2007. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, for information on the coal contract settlement. Factors that offset, in part, the favorable variance in cash flows from operations in 2008 were a $93 million increase in cash payments related to the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident, net of insurance recoveries, an increase in natural gas inventories resulting from price increases, higher interest payments, and higher levels of collateral posted with suppliers. At UE, cash from operating activities decreased in 2008, compared to 2007. The decrease is primarily due to a $24 million increase in net income tax payments in 2008, lower electric margins, increased system reliability expenditures as discussed in Results of Operations, and higher levels of net collateral posted with suppliers. Also contributing to the unfavorable variance in 2008 was a $93 million increase in cash payments related to the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident, net of insurance recoveries, and a $146 million net decrease in affiliate payables. Factors increasing cash from operations included a $34 million decrease in payments for storm restorations, a decrease in other operations and maintenance expenditures related to the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2008 as compared with the 2007 refueling and maintenance outage, reduction in interest payments, and the collection in 2008 of an $85 million affiliate receivable. In addition, cash flows from operations increased in 2008 compared with 2007 because of the timing of cash receipts for MISO receivables. At CIPS, cash from operating activities increased in 2008 compared with 2007. The increase was primarily due to net income tax refunds of $21 million in 2008, compared with net income tax payments of $44 million in 2007, an increase in gas cost over recovery from customers under the PGA, a $7 million increase in customer advances for construction, and favorable fluctuations in receivables and payables. In 2007, receivables increased due to the January 2, 2007, electric rate increases, related uncertainty surrounding a potential settlement agreement, and deterioration of collections. However, collections improved in 2008. The 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement also had a positive effect on cash from operations in 2008 compared with 2007. CIPS cash outflows from the settlement, net of reimbursements from generators, were $26 million less in 2008 than in 2007. CIPS experienced favorable fluctuations in intercompany receivable and payable balances resulting from changes in its year end 2008 income tax position and a receivable related to the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement compared with 2007. Partially offsetting the favorable variance in cash flow from operations was a larger increase in natural gas inventories in 2008 than in 2007, a decrease in electric costs over recovered from customers, and higher net levels of collateral posted with suppliers. Gencos cash from operating activities decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in fuel inventory and an increase in net income tax payments of $13 million. Reducing the unfavorable variance in cash flow from operations were higher electric margins, a payment from an Illinois coal mine owner for the premature closure of an Illinois mine, as discussed above, and a $6 million reduction in funding required by the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement in 2008 compared with 2007. CILCOs cash from operating activities increased in 2008, compared with 2007. The increase was primarily due to net income tax refunds of $15 million in 2008 compared with net income tax payments of $35 million in 2007, higher electric margins, a reduction of coal inventory at AERG, an increase in gas cost recovered from customers under a PGA, an increase in electric cost over recovered from customers, and favorable fluctuations in receivables and payables. In 2007, receivables increased due to the January 2, 2007, electric rate increases, related uncertainty surrounding a 51 Table of Contents potential settlement agreement, and deterioration of collections. However, collections improved in 2008. The 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement also had a positive effect on cash from operations in 2008 compared with 2007. The cash outflows related to the settlement, including AERGs obligation, were $16 million lower in 2008 than in 2007. Partially offsetting these increases in cash from operations were a larger increase in natural gas inventories during 2008 compared with 2007, as both price and volumes increased, and higher net levels of collateral posted with suppliers. IPs cash from operating activities increased in 2008, compared with 2007. The increase was primarily due to net income tax refunds of $43 million in 2008, compared with net income tax payments of $18 million in 2007, increased electric and natural gas margins, an increase in gas cost recovered from customers under a PGA, an increase in electric power costs over recovered from customers, a $7 million increase in customer advances for construction, and favorable fluctuations in receivables and payables. In 2007, receivables increased due to the January 2, 2007, electric rate increases, related uncertainty surrounding a potential settlement agreement, and deterioration of collections. However, collections improved in 2008. The 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement also had a positive effect on cash from operations in 2008 compared to 2007. IP cash outflows related to the settlement, net of reimbursements from generators, were $35 million lower in 2008 than in 2007. IP experienced favorable fluctuations in intercompany receivable and payable balances resulting from changes in its year end 2008 income tax position and a receivable related to the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement compared with 2007. In addition, operating cash required for major repairs in response to 2008 storms was $8 million less than major storm repairs in 2007. Partially offsetting these increases to operating cash flows were a $10 million increase in interest payments and higher net levels of collateral posted with suppliers. Pension Funding Amerens pension plans are funded in compliance with income tax regulations and to meet federal funding or regulatory requirements. As a result, Ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the greater of the pension expense or the legally required minimum contribution. Considering Amerens assumptions at December 31, 2009, its investment performance in 2009, and its pension funding policy, Ameren expects to make annual contributions of $75 million to $225 million in each of the next five years, with aggregate estimated contributions of $740 million. We expect UEs, CIPS, Gencos, CILCOs, and IPs portion of the future funding requirements to be 66%, 6%, 9%, 9% and 10%, respectively. These amounts are estimates. They may change with actual investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in our assumptions, any pertinent changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions. In 2009, Ameren contributed $99 million to its pension plans. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report and Outlook for additional information. Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2009 versus 2008 Ameren used less cash for investing activities in 2009 than in 2008. Net cash used for capital expenditures decreased in 2009 as a result of efforts to reduce, defer or cancel capital expenditure programs in light of economic conditions and the completion of power plant scrubber projects in the Merchant Generation business. Additionally, a $93 million decrease in nuclear fuel expenditures related to timing of purchases and a $10 million decrease in emission allowance purchases, because of lower prices and lower generation levels as well as reduced emission levels resulting from completion of plant scrubber projects in 2009, benefited cash during 2009. UEs cash used in investing activities decreased during 2009, compared with 2008. Nuclear fuel expenditures decreased $93 million as a result of the timing of purchases. Cash used in investing activities in 2009 did not benefit from the receipt of $36 million in proceeds from intercompany note receivables with Ameren, and one of its subsidiaries, as occurred during 2008. Capital expenditures were consistent year over year. Reductions in planned capital expenditures for distribution system and power plant improvements in 2009 were offset by increased expenditures to repair severe storm damage and $93 million of Taum Sauk rebuild expenditures. CIPS cash used in investing activities during 2009 increased compared with 2008. Capital expenditures increased $14 million in 2009 from 2008 primarily because of increased capital expenditures to repair severe storm damage. Gencos cash used in investing activities increased in 2009 compared with 2008 because of $73 million of net money pool advances in 2009. Capital expenditures decreased $40 million, principally because of reduced spending related to power plant scrubber projects. One scrubber project was completed in November 2009 and a second scrubber project is estimated to be completed in 2010. Emission allowance purchases decreased $11 million, because of lower prices and lower generation levels as well as reduced emission levels resulting from the completion of a plant scrubber project in 2009, which resulted in a benefit to cash in 2009. CILCOs cash used in investing activities decreased in 2009, compared with 2008, as a result of a $165 million decrease in capital expenditures, primarily because of the completion of a power plant scrubber project in March 2009 and other reductions in capital expenditures at AERG. IPs cash used in investing activities decreased in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily as a result of money pool activity. During 2009, IP received a net repayment of $44 million in money pool advances compared with $44 million of net contributions during 2008. Partially offsetting this benefit to cash was an increase in advances to AITC for construction under a joint ownership agreement. IP received funding for this construction under a generator interconnection agreement related to on going transmission upgrade projects. 52 Table of Contents 2008 versus 2007 Ameren used more cash for investing activities in 2008, than in 2007. Net cash used for capital expenditures increased in 2008 as a result of power plant scrubber projects, upgrades at various power plants, and reliability improvements of the transmission and distribution system. Additionally, increased purchases and higher prices resulted in a $105 million increase in nuclear fuel expenditures. UEs cash used in investing activities increased during 2008, compared with 2007. Nuclear fuel expenditures increased $105 million resulting from increased purchases for future refueling outages at its Callaway nuclear plant and higher prices. In addition, capital expenditures increased $249 million. This increase was a result of increased spending related to a power plant scrubber project, reliability improvements of the transmission and distribution system, and various plant upgrades. This increase was partially offset by UEs receipt of $36 million in proceeds from intercompany note receivables with Ameren, and one of its subsidiaries. CIPS cash used in investing activities during 2008 increased, compared with 2007. Capital expenditures increased $17 million in 2008 from 2007, primarily because of reliability improvements to the transmission and distribution system. During both years, this was offset by cash received from payments on an intercompany note receivable from Genco. Gencos cash used in investing activities increased in 2008 compared with 2007. Capital expenditures increased $126 million, principally because of a power plant scrubber project. This increase was offset, in part, by a $7 million decrease in emission allowance purchases. CILCOs cash used in investing activities increased in 2008, compared with 2007. Cash used in investing activities increased as a result of a $65 million increase in capital expenditures, primarily because of a power plant scrubber project and plant upgrades at AERG. The receipt of net repayments of money pool advances in 2007 compared to 2008 also increased cash flows used in investing activities in 2008. IPs cash used in investing activities increased in 2008 compared with 2007. Capital expenditures increased by $8 million in 2008 from 2007, primarily because of reliability improvements to the transmission and distribution system. Net money pool advances increased by $44 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Capital Expenditures The following table presents the capital expenditures by the Ameren Companies for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007: Capital Expenditures 2009 2008 2007 Ameren(a) $ 1,704 $ 1,896 $ 1,381 UE 872 874 625 CIPS 110 96 79 Genco 277 317 191 CILCO (Illinois Regulated) 63 61 64 CILCO (AERG) 91 258 190 IP 186 186 178 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries. Amerens 2009 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE spent $173 million toward a scrubber at one of its power plants and $93 million toward the Taum Sauk rebuild, and it incurred storm related expenditures of $78 million. CIPS, CILCO and IP incurred storm related expenditures of $29 million, $3 million, and $5 million, respectively. At Genco and AERG, there were cash outlays of $169 million and $38 million, respectively, for power plant scrubber projects. The scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental regulations. Other capital expenditures were made principally to maintain, upgrade, and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP as well as various plant upgrades. Amerens 2008 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE spent $149 million toward a scrubber at one of its power plants, and incurred storm related expenditures of $12 million. CIPS and IP incurred storm related expenditures of $7 million and $8 million, respectively. At Genco and AERG, there were cash outlays of $205 million and $137 million, respectively, for power plant scrubber projects. The scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental regulations. Other capital expenditures were made principally to maintain, upgrade, and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP as well as various plant upgrades. Amerens 2007 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE spent $101 million toward a scrubber at one of its power plants, and incurred storm related expenditures of $56 million. IP incurred storm related expenditures of $24 million. At Genco and AERG, there were cash outlays of $102 million and $76 million, respectively, for power plant scrubber projects. In conjunction with the scrubber project, AERG also made expenditures for a power plant boiler upgrade of $45 million. Other capital expenditures were made principally to maintain, upgrade, and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP as well as various plant upgrades. 53 Table of Contents The following table estimates the capital expenditures that will be incurred by the Ameren Companies from 2010 through 2014, including construction expenditures, capitalized interest for the Merchant Generation business, allowance for funds used during construction for our rate regulated utility business, and estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental standards: 2010 2011 2014 Total UE $ 695 $ 2,565 $ 3,465 $ 3,260 $ 4,160 CIPS 95 340 460 435 555 Genco 110 690 930 800 1,040 CILCO (Illinois Regulated) 60 250 340 310 400 CILCO (AERG) 5 130 175 135 180 IP 175 670 910 845 1,085 EEI 10 330 450 340 460 Other 50 125 170 175 220 Ameren(a) $ 1,200 $ 5,100 $ 6,900 $ 6,300 $ 8,100 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries. UEs estimated capital expenditures include transmission, distribution, and generation related investments, as well as expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations discussed below. CIPS, CILCOs (Illinois Regulated), and IPs estimated capital expenditures are primarily for electric and natural gas transmission and distribution related investments. Gencos estimated capital expenditures are primarily for compliance with environmental regulations and upgrades to existing coal and gas fired generating facilities. CILCOs (AERG) estimate includes capital expenditures primarily for compliance with environmental regulations at its generating facilities. We continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs. As a result, we could modify our plan for generation capacity, which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and whether capacity or power may be purchased, among other things. Any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material. Environmental Capital Expenditures Ameren, UE, Genco, AERG and EEI will incur significant costs in future years to comply with existing federal EPA and state regulations regarding SO2, NOx and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants. In May 2005, the EPA issued regulations with respect to SO2 and NOx emissions (the Clean Air Interstate Rule) and mercury emissions (the Clean Air Mercury Rule). The federal Clean Air Interstate Rule requires generating facilities in 28 eastern states, which include Missouri and Illinois, where our generating facilities are located, and the District of Columbia to participate in cap and trade programs to reduce annual SO2 emissions, annual NOx emissions, and ozone season NOx emissions. The cap and trade program for both annual and ozone season NOx emissions went into effect on January 1, 2009. The SO2 emissions cap and trade program is scheduled to take effect in 2010. In February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a decision that vacated the federal Clean Air Mercury Rule. The court ruled that the EPA erred in the method it used to remove electric generating units from the list of sources subject to the MACT requirements under the Clean Air Act. In February 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition for review filed by a group representing the electric utility industry. The impact of this decision is that the EPA will move forward with a MACT standard for mercury emissions and other hazardous air pollutants, such as acid gases. In a consent order, the EPA agreed to propose the regulation by March 2011 and to finalize the regulation by November 2011. Compliance is expected to be required in 2015. We cannot predict at this time the estimated capital or operating costs for compliance with such future environmental rules. In July 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a decision that vacated the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule. The court ruled that the regulation contained several fatal flaws, including a regional cap and trade program that cannot be used to facilitate the attainment of ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter. In September 2008, the EPA, as well as several environmental groups, a group representing the electric utility industry, and the National Mining Association, all filed petitions for rehearing with the U.S. Court of Appeals. In December 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals essentially reversed its July 2008 decision to vacate the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule. The U.S. Court of Appeals granted the EPA petition for reconsideration and remanded the rule to the EPA for further action to remedy the rules flaws in accordance with the U.S. Court of Appeals July 2008 opinion in the case. The impact of the decision is that the existing Illinois and Missouri rules to implement the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule will remain in effect until the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule is revised by the EPA, at which point the Illinois and Missouri rules may be subject to change. The EPA has stated that it expects to issue a new proposed version of the Clean Air Interstate Rule in 2010 and a final version in 2011. The state of Missouri has adopted rules to implement the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule for regulating SO2 and NOx emissions from electric generating units. The rules are a significant part of Missouris plan to attain existing ambient standards for ozone and fine particulates, as well as meeting the federal Clean Air Visibility Rule. The rules are expected to reduce NOx emissions by 30% and SO2 emissions by 75% by 2015. As a result of the Missouri rules, UE will use allowances and install pollution control equipment. UEs costs to comply with SO2 emission reductions required by the Clean Air Interstate Rule could increase materially if the EPA determines that existing allowances granted to sources under the Acid Rain Program cannot be used for compliance with the Clean Air Interstate Rule, or if a new allowance program is mandated by revisions to the Clean Air Interstate Rule. Missouri also adopted rules to implement the federal 54 Table of Contents Clean Air Mercury Rule. However, these rules are not enforceable since the U.S. Court of Appeals decision to vacate the federal Clean Air Mercury Rule. We do not believe that the court decision that vacated the federal Clean Air Mercury Rule will significantly affect pollution control obligations in Illinois in the near term. Under the MPS, as amended, Illinois generators may defer until 2015 the requirement to reduce mercury emissions by 90%, in exchange for accelerated installation of NOx and SO2 controls. This rule, when fully implemented, is expected to reduce mercury emissions by 90%, NOx emissions by 50%, and SO2 emissions by 70% by 2015 in Illinois. To comply with the rule, Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI have begun putting into service equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions. Genco, CILCO (AERG) and EEI will also need to install additional pollution control equipment. Current plans include installing scrubbers for SO2 reduction as well as optimizing operations of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems for NOx reduction at certain coal fired plants in Illinois. The Illinois Joint Committee on Administrative Rules approved a rule amendment in June 2009 that revised certain requirements of the MPS. As a result, Genco and CILCO (AERG) collectively were able to defer to subsequent years an estimated $300 million of environmental capital expenditures originally scheduled for 2009 through 2011. In March 2008, the EPA finalized regulations that will lower the ambient standard for ozone. Illinois and Missouri have each submitted their recommendations to the EPA for designating nonattainment areas. A final action by the EPA to designate nonattainment areas is expected in March 2010. State implementation plans will need to be submitted in 2013 unless Illinois and Missouri seek extensions for various requirement dates. Additional emission reductions may be required as a result of future state implementation plans. In January 2010, the EPA announced its plans to revise the ozone standard to a level lower than the level set in 2008. At this time, we are unable to determine the impact state implementation plans for such regulations would have on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The table below presents estimated capital costs that are based on current technology to comply with state air quality implementation plans, the MPS, federal ambient air quality standards including ozone and fine particulates, and the federal Clean Air Visibility rule. The estimates shown in the table below could change depending upon additional federal or state requirements, the requirements under a MACT standard, new technology, variations in costs of material or labor, or alternative compliance strategies, among other factors. The timing of estimated capital costs may also be influenced by whether emission allowances are used to comply with any future rules, thereby deferring capital investment. During 2009, Ameren identified significant opportunities to defer or reduce planned capital spending, which are reflected in the estimates provided in the table. The capital cost estimates are lower than previously anticipated, in part because of Amerens ability to manage its generating fleet to minimize emissions while complying with emission limits and air permit requirements. Furthermore, previous estimates included assumptions about potential and developing air regulations, including rules that were subsequently vacated by the courts. These estimates include capital spending to comply primarily with existing and known regulations as of December 31, 2009. 2010 2011 2014 2015 2017 Total UE(a) $ 160 $ 170 $ 215 $ 25 $ 35 $ 355 $ 410 Genco 95 650 785 30 35 775 915 AERG 5 120 150 65 75 190 230 EEI 5 275 335 0 5 280 345 Ameren $ 265 $ 1,215 $ 1,485 $ 120 $ 150 $ 1,600 $ 1,900 (a) UEs expenditures are expected to be recoverable in rates over time. In 2009, UE developed four year and 20 year Environmental Compliance Plans to comply with all environmental regulations, including rules under the Clean Water Act, to support its environmental cost recovery mechanism tariff request, which was a part of its July 2009 electric rate case filing. The plans contain a comprehensive assessment of environmental investments likely to be required of UE. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on UEs pending electric rate case. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of environmental matters, including global climate change. Cash Flows from Financing Activities 2009 versus 2008 As a result of turmoil in the capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009, we sought to improve our liquidity position. We replaced and extended the expiration of our credit facilities and sought to reduce our reliance on borrowings from these credit facilities, increase cash balances and increase the equity content of our capitalization. We also sought to eliminate debt at CILCORP as a step in simplifying our organizational structure. During 2009, Ameren and its subsidiaries issued $1 billion of senior debt and $634 million in common stock and used the proceeds to repurchase, redeem, and fund maturities of $631 million of long term debt, to reduce short term borrowings, and to fund capital expenditures and other working capital needs at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP. Comparatively, during 2008, Amerens subsidiaries issued $1.9 billion of senior debt and $154 million in common stock and used the proceeds to repurchase, redeem, and fund maturities of $842 million of long term debt, reduce short term borrowings, and fund capital expenditures and other working capital needs at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP. Amerens capital issuance costs increased in 2009 compared with 2008 because of $40 million in banking fees associated with the 2009 Multiyear Credit Agreements and the 2009 Illinois Credit 55 Table of Contents Agreement and $17 million of issuance costs associated with Amerens September 2009 common stock issuance, partially offset by a decrease in issuance costs associated with long term debt. Benefiting 2009 cash from financing activities, compared with 2008, was a $196 million decrease in common stock dividends, and a $47 million increase in generator advances received for construction under generator interconnection agreements, net of repayments. UEs net cash provided by financing activities decreased during 2009, compared with 2008, primarily because of $251 million of short term borrowings repayments in 2009 compared with net short term borrowings of $169 million in 2008, a $350 million decrease in the issuances of long term debt, and a $184 million increase in net repayments under an intercompany borrowing arrangement with Ameren. Benefits to cash for 2009, compared with 2008, included a $436 million capital contribution from Ameren funded by the proceeds of Amerens September 2009 common stock issuance, a $378 million decrease in redemptions of long term debt, and an $89 million decrease in common stock dividend payments. The proceeds from the capital contribution were primarily used to reduce outstanding short term borrowings. CIPS net cash used in financing activities increased during 2009 compared with 2008. CIPS used existing cash to fund a net reduction in money pool borrowings, to pay $47 million of dividends to Ameren in 2009, and to fund a $3 million increase in debt issuance costs as a result of the banking fees associated with the 2009 Illinois Credit Agreement. Benefiting the 2009 period was a $66 million capital contribution from Ameren. Gencos cash provided by financing activities increased during 2009 compared with 2008, primarily as a result of a $101 million reduction in dividends paid on common stock and $100 million change in short term borrowings repayments. These benefits to cash during the 2009 period were slightly offset by a $106 million decrease in net money pool borrowings and a $51 million decrease in the issuance of long term debt. CILCO had a net use of cash from financing activities in 2009, compared with a net source of cash in 2008 primarily as a result of the change in CILCOs money pool borrowings, $127 million increase in repayments of short term borrowings, a $150 decrease in issuance of long term debt, and a $6 million increase in capital issuance costs as a result of banking fees associated with the 2009 Illinois Credit Agreement. During 2009, CILCO repaid a net $98 million to the money pool; CILCO received $98 million of net borrowings in 2008. Cash from financing activities benefited from a $288 million increase in intercompany borrowings from Ameren, a $51 million capital contribution from CILCORP, and a $35 million decrease in redemptions of long term debt and preferred stock. IP had a net use of cash from financing activities during 2009, compared with a net source of cash in 2008, primarily as a result of a $730 million decrease in long term debt issuances. During 2009, cash from financing activities benefited from $175 million decrease in net short term borrowings repayments, a $141 million decrease in redemptions and maturities of long term debt, including IP SPT, $155 million capital contribution received from Ameren, and a $40 million increase in net generator advances received for construction under generator interconnection agreements. During 2009, IP used existing cash to fund the maturity of $250 million of its 7.50% mortgage bonds and to pay banking fees associated with the 2009 Illinois Credit Agreement. Comparatively, during 2008, IP issued $730 million of senior secured notes to redeem all of IPs outstanding auction rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds, which had adjusted to higher interest rates as a result of the collapse of the auction rate securities market, and to fund debt maturities and common stock dividends. 2008 versus 2007 During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Ameren Companies issued $1.9 billion of senior debt. The proceeds were used to repurchase, redeem, and fund maturities of $842 million of long term debt, to reduce short term borrowings, and to fund capital expenditures and other working capital needs at UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP. During the year ended December 31, 2007, net short term borrowings of $860 million and senior debt of $674 million were used to fund $488 million of maturities of long term debt, to fund working capital needs at Ameren subsidiaries and to build liquidity during a period of legislative uncertainty in Illinois. Additionally, CILCO redeemed the remaining shares of its 5.85% Class A preferred stock to complete the mandatory sinking fund redemption requirement, which resulted in a $16 million use of cash during 2008 compared with 2007. Benefiting 2008, compared with 2007, was a $63 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of Ameren common stock, which resulted from increased sales through Amerens 401(k) plan and DRPlus. UEs net cash from financing activities increased in the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. During 2008, UE used $699 million in proceeds from the issuance of senior secured notes to redeem outstanding auction rate environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds that had adjusted to higher interest rates as a result of the collapse of the auction rate securities market, and to fund the maturity of $148 million of UEs 6.75% first mortgage bonds. Additionally, net short term borrowings increased $321 million. These borrowings were primarily used to fund working capital needs and capital expenditures. In 2007, UE issued $424 million in senior secured notes and received a $380 million capital contribution from Ameren to fund working capital requirements and to reduce net short term borrowings. CIPS had a net use of cash from financing activities in 2008, compared with a net source of cash in 2007. This change occurred because CIPS used net money pool borrowings and existing cash to fund a net reduction in short term borrowings, to redeem $35 million of auction rate environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds that 56 Table of Contents had adjusted to higher interest rates as a result of the collapse of the auction rate securities market, and to fund the maturity of $15 million of its 5.375% senior secured notes during 2008. In 2007, CIPS used net short term borrowings of $90 million to fund working capital needs to build liquidity, and to fund $40 million of common stock dividends. Genco issued $300 million of 7.00% senior unsecured notes during 2008, which resulted in a net source of cash from financing activities compared with a net use of cash in 2007. The proceeds from the issuance were used to fund capital expenditures and other working capital requirements, including a net reduction of $200 million of short term borrowings during 2008 compared with 2007. CILCOs cash provided by financing activities decreased in 2008 compared with 2007. This decrease was primarily the result of CILCOs net repayments of short term borrowings during 2008 compared with 2007. These repayments were funded by a net increase in money pool borrowings of $98 million, primarily at AERG, and CILCOs issuance of $150 million of its 8.875% senior secured notes. Partially offsetting the decrease were reduced redemptions and maturities of long term debt in 2008. During 2008, $19 million of auction rate environmental improvement revenue refunding bonds that had adjusted to higher interest rates as a result of the collapse of the auction rate securities market were redeemed at CILCO. In 2007, $50 million of CILCOs 7.50% bonds matured. IPs cash from financing activities decreased in 2008, compared with 2007. During 2008, IP issued $730 million of senior secured notes and used the proceeds to redeem all of IPs outstanding auction rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds that had adjusted to higher rates as a result of the collapse of the auction rate securities market and to repay short term borrowings. Additionally, during 2008, IP funded $60 million of common stock dividends to Ameren and had net short term borrowings repayments of $175 million. Comparatively, during 2007, IP issued $250 million of senior secured notes, paid $61 million of common stock dividends, and had $100 million of net borrowings under the 2007 credit facility. These borrowings were used to fund $87 million of long term debt maturities and $43 million of net money pool repayments to build liquidity in 2007. Credit Facility Borrowings and Liquidity The liquidity needs of the Ameren Companies are typically supported through the use of available cash, short term intercompany borrowings, or drawings under committed bank credit facilities. See Note 4 Credit Facility Borrowings and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on credit facilities, short term borrowing activity, relevant interest rates, and borrowings under Amerens utility and non state regulated subsidiary money pool arrangements. The following table presents the committed bank credit facilities of Ameren and the Ameren Companies, and their availability as of December 31, 2009: Credit Facility Expiration Amount Committed Amount Available Ameren, UE and Genco: 2009 Multiyear revolving(a)(b) July 2011 $ 1,300 $ 555 (c) Ameren, CIPS, CILCO, and IP: 2009 Illinois revolving June 2011 800 700 (a) Ameren Companies may access these credit facilities through intercompany borrowing arrangements. (b) Includes the 2009 Multiyear Credit Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement. The Supplemental Agreement will terminate in July 2010 with all commitments and all outstanding amounts being consolidated with those under the 2009 Multiyear Credit Agreement. At that time, the combined maximum amount available to all borrowers will be $1.0795 billion, and the UE and Genco Borrowing Sublimits remain the same; Amerens Sublimit changes to $1.0795 billion. (c) In addition to amounts drawn on these facilities, the amount available is further reduced by standby letters of credit issued under the facilities. The amount of such letters of credit at December 31, 2009, was $15 million. The combined maximum amount available to all of the borrowers, collectively, under the 2009 Multiyear Credit Agreement and the Supplemental Credit Agreement (collectively, the 2009 Multiyear Credit Agreements) is $1.3 billion. The combined maximum amount available to each borrower, individually, under the 2009 Multiyear Credit Agreements is limited as follows: Ameren $1.15 billion, UE $500 million and Genco $150 million (such amounts being each borrowers Borrowing Sublimit). CIPS, CILCO, and IP have no borrowing authority or liability under the 2009 Multiyear Credit Agreements. These credit facilities were also available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short term borrowing authorizations, by EEI or other Ameren non state regulated subsidiaries through direct short term borrowings from Ameren and by most of Amerens merchant generating subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Ameren Services, Resources Company, AERG, Marketing Company and AFS, through a non state regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to coordinate and to provide for certain short term cash and working capital requirements. Separate money pools are maintained for utility and non state regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among Ameren, IP, and Ameren Services enables IP to make short term borrowings directly from Ameren. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time by IP under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money pool agreement, together with any outstanding external credit facility borrowings by IP, may not exceed $500 million, 57 Table of Contents pursuant to authorization from the ICC. IP is not currently borrowing under the unilateral borrowing agreement. Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the money pool agreements. See Note 4 Credit Facility Borrowings and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement. The combined maximum amount available to all borrowers collectively under the 2009 Illinois Credit Agreement is $800 million, and the combined maximum amount available to each borrower individually, under the 2009 Illinois Credit Agreement is limited as follows: Ameren $300 million, CIPS $135 million, CILCO $150 million, and IP $350 million. On January 21, 2009, Ameren entered into a $20 million term loan agreement due January 20, 2010, which was fully drawn on January 21, 2009. This term loan agreement was repaid at maturity in January 2010. See Note 4 Credit Facility Borrowings and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. In addition to committed credit facilities, a further source of liquidity for the Ameren Companies from time to time is available cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2009, Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO, and IP had $622 million, $267 million, $28 million, $6 million, $88 million, and $190 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. The issuance of short term debt securities by Amerens utility subsidiaries is subject to approval by FERC under the Federal Power Act. In March 2008, FERC issued an order authorizing these utility subsidiaries to issue such securities subject to the following limits on outstanding balances: UE $1 billion, CIPS $250 million, and CILCO $250 million. The authorization was effective as of April 1, 2008, and terminates on March 31, 2010. UE, CIPS and CILCO have pending requests with FERC seeking authority to issue short term debt securities subject to limits on outstanding balances of $1 billion, $300 million, and $250 million, respectively, for the period April 1, 2010, through March 31, 2012. IP has unlimited short term borrowing authorization from FERC. Genco was authorized by FERC in its March 2008 order to have up to $500 million of short term debt outstanding at any time. Genco is seeking a renewal of that authorization. AERG and EEI have unlimited short term borrowing authorization from FERC. The issuance of short term debt securities by Ameren is not subject to approval by any regulatory body. The Ameren Companies continually evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of their credit arrangements given changing business and credit market conditions. When business and credit market conditions warrant, changes may be made to existing credit agreements or other short term borrowing arrangements. Long term Debt and Equity The following table presents the issuances of common stock and the issuances, redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt and preferred stock (net of any issuance discounts and including any redemption premiums) for the years 2009, 2008, and 2007 for the Ameren Companies. For additional information related to the terms and uses of these issuances and the sources of funds and terms for the redemptions, see Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

In June 2008, UE filed a Form S 3 shelf registration statement registering the issuance of an indeterminate amount of certain types of securities, which expires in June 2011. The following table presents information with respect to the Form S 3 shelf registration statements filed and effective for certain Ameren Companies as of December 31, 2009: Effective Date Authorized Amount Ameren November 2008 Not Limited UE June 2008 Not Limited CIPS November 2008 Not Limited Genco November 2008 Not Limited CILCO November 2008 Not Limited IP November 2008 Not Limited In July 2008, Ameren filed a Form S 3 registration statement with the SEC authorizing the offering of six million additional shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at Amerens option, newly issued shares, treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Ameren is also selling newly issued shares of common stock under its 401(k) plan pursuant to an effective SEC Form S 8 registration statement. Under DRPlus and its 401(k) plan, Ameren issued 3.2 million, 4.0 million, and 1.7 million shares of common stock in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, which were valued at $82 million, $154 million, and $91 million for the respective years. In September 2009, Ameren issued and sold 21.85 million shares of its common stock at $25.25 per share, for proceeds of $535 million, net of $17 million of issuance costs. Ameren used the offering proceeds to make 59 Table of Contents investments in its rate regulated utility subsidiaries in the form of capital contributions as follows: UE $436 million, CIPS $13 million, CILCO $25 million, and IP $61 million. Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP may sell securities registered under their effective registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant such a sale. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus that meets the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants See Note 4 Credit Facility Borrowings and Liquidity and Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions (and applicable cross default provisions) contained in our bank credit and term loan facilities and in certain of the Ameren Companies indenture agreements and articles of incorporation. At December 31, 2009, the Ameren Companies were in compliance with their credit facility, indenture, and articles of incorporation provisions and covenants. We consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows. Inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses. After assessing our current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets or make access to the capital markets uncertain or limited. Such events could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. Dividends Ameren paid to its shareholders common stock dividends totaling $338 million, or $1.54 per share, in 2009, $534 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2008, and $527 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2007. This resulted in a payout rate based on net income of 55% in 2009, 88% in 2008, and 85% in 2007. Dividends paid to common shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the same periods were 17% in 2009, 35% in 2008 and 48% in 2007. The amount and timing of dividends payable on Amerens common stock are within the sole discretion of Amerens board of directors. The board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends. However, as it has done in the past, the board of directors is expected to consider various issues, including Amerens overall payout ratio, payout ratios of our peers, projected cash flow and potential future cash flow requirements, historical earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, impacts of regulatory orders or legislation, and other key business considerations. On February 12, 2010, the board of directors of Ameren declared a quarterly dividend on Amerens common stock of 38.5 cents per share, payable on March 31, 2010, to shareholders of record on March 10, 2010. Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the Ameren Companies payment of dividends in certain circumstances. At December 31, 2009, none of these circumstances existed at the Ameren Companies and, as a result, they were allowed to pay dividends. UE would be restricted as to dividend payments on its common and preferred stock if it were to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures. CIPS articles of incorporation and mortgage indentures require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Gencos indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making any dividend payments on common stock if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold. CILCO has restrictions in its articles of incorporation on dividend payments on common stock relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock. 60 Table of Contents UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP as well as certain other nonregistrant Ameren subsidiaries are subject to Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for any officer or director of a public utility, as defined in the Federal Power Act, to participate in the making or paying of any dividend from any funds properly included in capital account. The meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the Federal Power Act or FERC regulations; however, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, (2) the dividends are not excessive and (3) there is no self dealing on the part of corporate officials. At a minimum, Ameren believes that dividends can be paid by its subsidiaries that are public utilities from net income and retained earnings. In addition, under Illinois law, CIPS, CILCO and IP may not pay any dividend on their respective stock, unless, among other things, their respective earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves, or unless CIPS, CILCO or IP has specific authorization from the ICC. The following table presents common stock dividends paid by Ameren Corporation and by Amerens subsidiaries to their respective parents. 2009 2008 2007 UE $ 175 $ 264 $ 267 CIPS 47 40 Genco 101 113 CILCO 20 IP 31 60 61 Nonregistrants 65 109 46 Dividends paid by Ameren $ 338 $ 534 $ 527 Certain of the Ameren Companies have issued preferred stock on which they are obligated to make preferred dividend payments. Each companys board of directors considers the declaration of the preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which the dividend is payable and the amount to be paid. See Note 10 Preferred Stock under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred stock issuances. Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding expected minimum funding levels for our pension plans. These expected pension funding amounts are not included in the table below. In addition, routine short term purchase order commitments are not included.

(d) The weighted average variable rate debt has been calculated using the interest rate as of December 31, 2009. (e) Amounts related to certain real estate leases and railroad licenses have indefinite payment periods. Amerens $2 million annual obligation for these items is included in the Less than 1 Year, 1 3 Years, and 3 5 Years columns. Amounts for After 5 Years are not included in the total amount because that period is indefinite. (f) See Other Obligations within Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8 of this report, for discussion of items represented herein. (g) Less than $1 million. As of December 31, 2009, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits were $135 million, $88 million, $ million, $28 million, $15 million and $ million for Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP, respectively. It is reasonably possible to expect that the settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit will result in an underpayment or overpayment of tax and related interest. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the timing of cash payments or receipts associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The amount and timing of certain payments or receipts is not reliably estimable or determinable at this time. See Note 13 Income Taxes under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding the Ameren Companies unrecognized tax benefits and related liabilities for interest expense. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2009, none of the Ameren Companies had any off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future. Credit Ratings The following table presents the principal credit ratings of the Ameren Companies by Moodys, S&P, and Fitch effective on the date of this report: Moodys S&P Fitch Ameren: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa3 BBB BBB + Senior unsecured debt Baa3 BB + BBB + UE: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa2 BBB BBB + Secured debt A3 BBB A CIPS: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa3 BBB BBB Secured debt Baa1 BBB + BBB + Senior unsecured debt Baa3 BBB BBB Genco: Issuer/corporate credit rating BBB BBB + Senior unsecured debt Baa3 BBB BBB + CILCO: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa3 BBB BBB Secured debt Baa1 BBB + A IP: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa3 BBB BBB Secured debt Baa1 BBB BBB + Moodys Ratings Actions On January 29, 2009, Moodys affirmed the ratings of CIPS, CILCO and IP and changed their rating outlooks to stable from positive. According to Moodys, the change in the rating outlooks of these three companies was based on the near term expiration of the 2007 and 2006 $500 million 62 Table of Contents credit facilities in January 2010 and related liquidity concerns. Moodys also on January 29, 2009, affirmed the ratings of Ameren and UE with a stable outlook based on the January 2009 MoPSC electric rate order approving a rate increase and a FAC for UE. On February 16, 2009, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO, and IP with a stable outlook. The affirmation reflected Moodys view that Amerens announcement to reduce its common dividend by 39% was a conservative, prudent, and credit positive action that would conserve cash and support financial coverage metrics. Moodys stated that the more conservative dividend payout should also help facilitate the renewal of Amerens credit facilities that expired in 2010. They stated the dividend reduction should continue to reduce reliance on the credit facilities going forward and would likely be viewed favorably by lenders considering renewing or entering into new facilities with Ameren and its subsidiaries, which was important considering constrained credit market conditions at that time. According to Moodys, the stable outlook on Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO, and IP reflected constructive rate case outcomes at UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP, including the approval of a FAC at UE; the improving regulatory environments for investor owned utilities in Illinois and Missouri at that time; and Moodys expectation that financial and cash flow coverage metrics should remain adequate to maintain current rating levels. In addition, Moodys noted that the dividend reduction was supportive of the stable ratings outlooks and provided Ameren and its subsidiaries additional cushion at the rating levels. On July 1, 2009, Moodys stated that the successful execution of new two year bank credit facilities was supportive of the credit quality of Ameren and its utility subsidiaries. However, Moodys did not make any changes in Amerens or its subsidiaries ratings or outlooks as a result of this action. On August 3, 2009, Moodys upgraded the majority of senior secured debt ratings of investment grade regulated utilities by one notch. Senior secured debt ratings at UE were upgraded from Baa1 to A3 and at CIPS and IP from Baa3 to Baa2. Moodys stated the rating action widened the notching between most senior secured debt ratings and senior unsecured debt ratings of investment grade regulated utilities to two notches from one previously. Moodys noted the wider notching was based on its analysis of the history of regulated utility defaults, which indicated that regulated utilities have defaulted at a lower rate and experienced lower loss given default rates than nonfinancial, nonutility corporate issuers. On August 13, 2009, Moodys upgraded the ratings of CIPS, CILCO and IP. Issuer/corporate credit ratings at CIPS, CILCO and IP were upgraded from Ba1 to Baa3. Moodys also upgraded the senior secured debt ratings at CIPS, CILCO and IP from Baa2 to Baa1. Moodys cited the execution of new bank credit facilities and an improved political and regulatory environment in Illinois as the basis for the return to investment grade status of the issuer/corporate ratings. Moodys also affirmed the ratings of Ameren, UE and Genco and assigned a stable outlook for Ameren and all of its rated subsidiaries. S&P Ratings Actions On February 25, 2009, S&P stated that it viewed the reduction in Amerens dividend as credit supportive. S&P did not make any changes in Amerens or its subsidiaries credit ratings or outlooks as a result of this action. S&P raised the business profile of UE to excellent from strong to reflect the electric rate order issued by the MoPSC in January 2009, which S&P viewed as constructive. S&P lowered the business profile of CILCO to satisfactory from strong. On February 25, 2010, S&P assigned improved business risk profiles to CIPS and IP of excellent from strong and to CILCO of strong from satisfactory. Fitch Ratings Actions On February 17, 2009, Fitch stated that the reduction in Amerens common stock dividend and other cost cutting measures would be favorable to bondholders and credit quality. Fitch did not make any changes in Amerens or its subsidiaries ratings or outlooks as a result of this action. On March 9, 2009, Fitch lowered the credit ratings of UE by one notch as follows: issuer rating to BBB+, senior secured debt to A, subordinated debt to BBB+, and preferred stock to BBB+. The rating outlook was changed to stable. Fitch stated that these downgrades were made because of deteriorating financial measures over the past several years and the expectation that they will not improve materially without further rate support. They noted the financial deterioration was primarily due to increasing fuel and operating costs and a large capital expenditure program. On July 31, 2009, Fitch affirmed the credit rating of Genco and changed its rating outlook to negative from stable. Additionally, Fitch affirmed the credit ratings of Ameren with a stable outlook. According to Fitch, the change in the credit rating outlook of Genco was based on the unfavorable outlook for wholesale energy prices and the sensitivity of the companys largely coal fired generating fleet to greenhouse gas and other environmental regulations. According to Fitch, the affirmation of Amerens credit ratings and stable outlook reflected the significant earnings and cash flow contribution derived from regulated utilities, the beneficial impact of recent rate increases in Illinois and Missouri, the savings generated by the February 2009 dividend reduction, and steps taken to maintain liquidity, including the renewal of bank credit facilities. On January 22, 2010, Fitch announced new guidelines that affect its ratings on deferrable coupon hybrid securities and preferred stock for utility issuers. Under these new guidelines, Fitch will rate these securities two notches below the issuers senior unsecured debt ratings. The prior guidelines rated these securities one notch below. The ratings for UE, CIPS, CILCO and IPs preferred stock, and for UEs 63 Table of Contents 7.69% subordinated deferrable interest debentures, were affected by this industry wide methodology change. Collateral Postings Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. Such changes may also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel, power, and gas supply, among other things, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. Collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties including postings related to exchange traded contracts at December 31, 2009, were $106 million, $25 million, $3 million, $1 million, and $14 million at Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP, respectively. The amount of collateral external counterparties posted with Ameren was $12 million at December 31, 2009. Sub investment grade issuer or senior unsecured debt ratings (lower than BBB or Baa3) at December 31, 2009, could have resulted in Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO or IP being required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to $368 million, $129 million, $29 million, $48 million, $44 million, and $52 million, respectively. Changes in commodity prices could trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments at current credit ratings. If market prices were 15% higher than December 31, 2009, levels in the next twelve months and 20% higher thereafter through the end of the term of the commodity contracts, then Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO or IP could be required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations up to approximately $171 million, $82 million, $ million, $ million, $9 million, and $ million, respectively. If market prices were 15% lower than December 31, 2009, levels in the next twelve months and 20% lower thereafter through the end of the term of the commodity contracts, then Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO or IP could be required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations up to approximately $329 million, $171 million, $14 million, $ million, $53 million, and $50 million, respectively. The cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can also increase or decrease depending upon the credit ratings of the borrower. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. It should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. OUTLOOK Below are some key trends that may affect the Ameren Companies financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in 2010 and beyond. Economy and Capital and Credit Markets In 2008 and 2009, global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility. While these markets improved during 2009, the availability and cost of capital and economic activity continue to be significantly affected. We believe that these events have several implications for our industry as a whole, including Ameren. They include the following: Access to Capital Markets and Cost of Capital The extreme disruption in the capital markets limited the ability of many companies, including the Ameren Companies, to freely access the capital and credit markets to support their operations and to refinance debt. Ameren and its subsidiaries continued to have access to the capital markets, as evidenced by Amerens, UEs, Gencos, CILCOs and IPs sale of debt securities in late 2008 and 2009, as well as Amerens common stock offering in September 2009. This access has been at commercially acceptable but higher rates in the case of the issuance of certain debt securities. Credit Facilities On June 30, 2009, Ameren and certain of its subsidiaries successfully reached definitive multiyear credit facility agreements. These facilities cumulatively provide $2.1 billion of credit through July 14, 2010, reducing to $1.8795 billion through June 30, 2011, and to $1.0795 billion through July 14, 2011. The costs of these credit facilities are significantly higher than the facilities they replaced. The costs to enter into the multiyear credit facility agreements were $40 million in the aggregate (UE $11 million, CIPS $3 million, Genco $4 million, CILCORP $14 million, CILCO $7 million, and IP $7 million). The costs will be amortized over the term of the facilities. In addition, borrowing rates under the facilities increased significantly, including, in the case of Ameren, from LIBOR plus 0.5%, under the prior credit facilities, to LIBOR plus 2.75%. Ameren intends to replace or extend its credit facility agreements during 2010. Economic Conditions Weak economic conditions have resulted in reduced power prices, lower customer sales growth, or sales contraction, particularly with respect to industrial sales, and higher financing costs, among other things. Weak economic conditions also expose the Ameren Companies to greater risk of default by counterparties, potentially higher bad debt expenses, and the risk of impairment of goodwill and long lived assets, among other things. Based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test completed as of October 31, 2009, the estimated fair value of Amerens Merchant Generation reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a nominal amount. The failure in the future of this reporting unit, or any reporting unit, to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows or a further decline of observable industry market multiples may reduce its estimated fair value below its carrying value and would likely result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge. Although we are unable to predict when the U.S. economy will fully recover from the economic downturn, we currently expect economic conditions to improve in 2010. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the weak economy on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Investment Returns The disruption in the capital markets, coupled with weak global economic conditions, adversely affected financial markets. As a result, we 64 Table of Contents experienced lower than expected investment returns in 2008 in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. During 2009, the actual return on investment of the pension plan assets was equal to the expected investment return while the actual return on investment of postretirement benefit assets exceeded the expected return. Lower returns increase our future pension and postretirement expenses and pension funding levels. Our future expenses and funding levels will also be affected by future investment returns and future discount rate levels. Operating and Capital Expenditures The Ameren Companies will continue to make significant levels of investments and incur expenditures for their electric and natural gas utility infrastructure in order to improve overall system reliability, comply with environmental regulations, and improve plant performance. However, in response to the significant level of disruption and uncertainties in the capital and credit markets and weak economic conditions that reduced power prices and to help our customers with their future energy costs, we reduced our planned capital expenditures for 2010 through 2013 by approximately $2 billion, as compared to earlier plans. Ameren also took steps to control operations and maintenance expenditures. Ameren is managing power plant outages and labor costs, among other things. Any expenditure control initiatives will be balanced against a continued long term commitment to invest in our electric and natural gas infrastructure to provide safe, reliable electric and natural gas delivery services to our customers; to meet federal and state environmental, reliability, and other regulations; and the need to maintain a solid overall liquidity and credit ratings profile to meet our operating, capital, and financing needs under challenging capital and credit market conditions. Liquidity At December 31, 2009, Ameren, on a consolidated basis, had available liquidity, in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under its existing credit facilities, of approximately $1.9 billion, which was $0.6 billion more than it had at the end of 2008. We believe that our liquidity is adequate given our expected operating cash flows, capital expenditures, and related financing plans (including accessing our existing credit facilities). However, there can be no assurance that significant changes in economic conditions, further disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or other unforeseen events will not materially affect our ability to execute our expected operating, capital or financing plans. Current Capital Expenditure Plans Between 2010 and 2017, Ameren expects to invest up to $1.9 billion, in the aggregate, to retrofit its coal fired power plants with pollution control equipment in compliance with emissions related environmental laws and regulations. Any pollution control investments will result in decreased plant availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately 20% of this investment is expected to be in our Missouri Regulated operations, and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers, subject to prudency reviews. Regulatory lag may materially impact the timing of such recovery and, therefore, our cash flows and related financing needs. The recoverability of amounts expended in Merchant Generation operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions reflecting increased environmental costs for coal fired generators. Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on emissions would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force Ameren and other similarly situated electric power generators to close some coal fired facilities. Investments to control emissions at Amerens coal fired power plants to comply with future legislation or regulations would significantly increase future capital expenditures and operations and maintenance expenses, which if excessive could result in the closures of coal fired power plants, impairment of assets, or otherwise materially adversely affect Amerens results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. UE continues to evaluate its longer term needs for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity. UEs integrated resource plan filed with the MoPSC in February 2008 included the expectation that new baseload generation capacity would be required in the 2018 to 2020 time frame. Due to the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload power plant, UE continues to study future plant alternatives, including energy efficiency programs that could help defer new plant construction. UE introduced multiple energy efficiency programs in 2009. The goal of these and future UE energy efficiency programs is to reduce usage by 540 megawatts by 2025, which is the equivalent of a medium size coal fired power plant. UE will consider all available and feasible generation options to meet future customer requirements as part of an integrated resource plan that UE will file with the MoPSC in 2011. In July 2008, UE filed an application with the NRC for a combined construction and operating license for a new 1,600 megawatt nuclear unit at UEs existing Callaway County, Missouri, nuclear plant site. In June 2009, UE requested the NRC suspend review of the COLA and all activities related to the COLA. As of December 31, 2009, UE had capitalized approximately $69 million as construction work in progress related to the COLA. The incurred costs will remain capitalized while management assesses all options to maximize the value of its investment in this project. If all efforts are permanently abandoned with respect to the future construction of a new nuclear unit or management concludes it is probable the costs incurred will be disallowed in rates, it is possible that a charge to earnings could be recognized in a future period. UE intends to submit a license extension application with the NRC to extend its existing Callaway nuclear plants 65 Table of Contents operating license by 20 years so that the operating license will expire in 2044. UE cannot predict whether or when the NRC will approve the license extension. Over the next few years, we expect to make significant investments in our electric and natural gas infrastructure and to incur increased operations and maintenance expenses to improve overall system reliability. We are projecting higher labor and material costs for these capital expenditures. We expect these costs or investments at our rate regulated businesses to be ultimately recovered in rates, subject to prudency reviews by regulators, although rate case outcomes and regulatory lag could materially impact the timing of such recovery and, therefore, our cash flows, related financing needs and the timing in which we are able to proceed with these projects. Ameren is evaluating opportunities to expand its transmission assets. New transmission projects have the potential to reduce congestion, improve reliability, and facilitate movement of renewable energy, typically generated in remote areas, to population centers where demand is at its highest. Increased investments for environmental compliance, reliability improvement, and new baseload capacity will result in higher depreciation and financing costs. Revenues The earnings of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are largely determined by the regulation of their rates by state agencies. Rising costs, including labor, material, depreciation and financing costs, coupled with increased capital and operations and maintenance expenditures targeted at enhanced distribution system reliability and environmental compliance, are expected. Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP anticipate regulatory lag until their requests to increase rates to recover such costs on a timely basis are granted by state regulators. Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP expect to file rate cases frequently. UE has agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate case before March 15, 2010. In current and future rate cases, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP will continue to seek cost recovery and tracking mechanisms from their state regulators to reduce regulatory lag. In July 2009, a new law became effective in Illinois that allows electric and natural gas utilities to recover through a rate adjustment the difference between their actual bad debt expense and the bad debt expense included in their base rates. In February 2010, the ICC approved the Ameren Illinois Utilities electric and natural gas rate adjustment tariffs to recover bad debt expense not recovered in rates. The tariffs provide utilities the ability to adjust their base rates annually through a rate adjustment mechanism that applies to 2008 and subsequent years. The Ameren Illinois Utilities were required to make a one time donation of $10 million (CIPS $2 million, CILCO $2 million, and IP $6 million) for customer assistance programs, as required by the legislation. The amount of the required one time donation and the impact of the recovery of 2008 and 2009 bad debt expenses were reflected in 2009 earnings. In June 2009, CIPS, CILCO and IP filed requests with the ICC to increase their annual revenues for electric and natural gas delivery services. The currently pending requests, as amended, seek to increase annual revenues from electric delivery service by $115 million in the aggregate (CIPS $38 million, CILCO $17 million, and IP $60 million). The electric rate increase requests are based on an 11.3% to 11.7% return on equity, a capital structure composed of 44% to 49% equity, an aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of $2.3 billion, and a test year ended December 31, 2008, with certain known and measurable adjustments through May 2010. The currently pending requests, as amended, seek to increase annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by $15 million in the aggregate (CIPS $6 million, CILCO $2 million, and IP $7 million). The natural gas rate increase requests are based on a 10.8% to 11.2% return on equity, a capital structure composed of 44% to 49% equity, an aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of $1.0 billion, and a test year ended December 31, 2008, with certain known and measurable adjustments through May 2010. The ICC staff has recommended, as amended, a net increase in revenues for electric delivery service for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of $57 million in the aggregate (CIPS $21 million increase, CILCO $5 million increase, and IP $31 million increase) and a net decrease in revenues for natural gas delivery service of $11 million in the aggregate (CILCO $6 million decrease, and IP $5 million decrease). The ICC proceedings relating to the proposed electric and natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, and decisions by the ICC in such proceedings are required by May 2010. UE filed a request with the MoPSC in July 2009 to increase its annual revenues for electric service by $402 million. Included in this increase request was approximately $227 million of anticipated increases in normalized net fuel costs in excess of the net fuel costs included in base rates previously authorized by the MoPSC in its January 2009 electric rate order, which, absent initiation of this general rate proceeding, would have been eligible for recovery through UEs existing FAC. The initial electric rate increase was based on an 11.5% return on equity, a capital structure composed of 47.4% equity, a rate base for UE of $6.0 billion, and a test year ended March 31, 2009, with certain pro forma adjustments through the anticipated true up date of January 31, 2010. In February 2010, UE filed rebuttal testimony relating to certain positions taken by interveners in the rate case and modified its recommended return on equity to 10.8%. The MoPSC staff has recommended an increase to UEs annual revenues of between $218 million to $251 million. Included in this recommendation was approximately $214 million of increases in normalized net fuel costs. The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed electric service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 66 Table of Contents 11 months, and a decision by the MoPSC in such proceeding is required by the end of June 2010. As part of its filing, UE also requested that the MoPSC approve the implementation of an environmental cost recovery mechanism and a storm restoration cost tracker as well as the continued use of the FAC and the vegetation management and infrastructural inspection cost tracking mechanism that the MoPSC previously authorized in its January 2009 electric rate order. The environmental cost recovery mechanism, if approved, would allow UE to adjust electric rates twice each year outside of general rate proceedings to reflect changes in its costs prudently incurred to comply with federal, state, or local environmental laws, regulations, or rules greater than or less than the amount set in base rates. Rate adjustments pursuant to this cost recovery mechanism would not be permitted to exceed an annual amount equal to 2.5% of UEs gross jurisdictional electric revenues and would be subject to prudency reviews by the MoPSC. The storm restoration cost tracker would permit UE a more timely recovery of storm restoration operations and maintenance expenditures. The MoPSC issued an electric rate order in January 2009 approving an increase in annual electric revenues of approximately $162 million. New rates were effective March 1, 2009. In addition, pursuant to the accounting order issued by the MoPSC in April 2008, the rate order concluded that the $25 million of operations and maintenance expenses incurred as a result of a severe ice storm in January 2007 should be amortized and recovered over a five year period starting March 1, 2009. The MoPSC also allowed recovery of $12 million of costs associated with a March 2007 FERC order that resettled costs among MISO market participants. UE recorded a regulatory asset for these costs at December 31, 2008, which are being amortized and recovered over a two year period beginning March 1, 2009. In its electric rate order issued in January 2009, the MoPSC approved UEs implementation of a FAC and a vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism. The FAC allows an adjustment of electric rates three times per year for a pass through to customers of 95% of changes in fuel and purchased power costs, net of off system revenues, including MISO costs and revenues, greater or less than the amount set in base rates, subject to MoPSC prudency reviews. The vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism provides for the tracking of expenditures that are greater or less than amounts provided for in UEs annual revenues for electric service in a particular year, subject to a 10% limitation on increases in any one year. The tracked amounts may be reflected in rates set in future rate cases. Even though Taum Sauk was not available to generate electricity for off system revenues during 2009, UE included $19 million in the calculation of the FAC as if Taum Sauk had generated off system revenues. Therefore, UEs customers received the benefit of Taum Sauks historical off system revenues even though the plant was not operational. UEs earnings and cash flows from operations will increase after Taum Sauk becomes operational, which is expected to be in the second quarter of 2010, since the adjustment factor will be eliminated from the FAC calculation. Taum Sauk is expected to increase UEs 2010 margins by $1.8 million per month, when Taum Sauk returns to service in the second quarter of 2010. UE provides power to Norandas smelter plant in New Madrid, Missouri, which has historically used approximately four million megawatthours of power annually, making Noranda UEs single largest customer. As a result of a severe ice storm in January 2009, Norandas smelter plant experienced a power outage related to non UE lines that deliver power to the substation serving the plant. Noranda stated in its Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008, that the outage affected approximately 75% of the smelter plants capacity. In a September 30, 2009, press release, Noranda stated that its smelter plant had initiated steps to return operations to full capacity. These steps include restarting the third of its three production lines. The smelter plants load has been rising steadily as repairs have been made to its production lines, with full production expected to be reached in the second quarter of 2010. As a result, UE expects its margins from sales to Noranda will increase by approximately $40 million in 2010 compared with 2009. UEs July 2009 electric rate case filing with the MoPSC seeks approval to revise the tariff under which it serves Noranda to prospectively address the significant lost revenues UE can incur due to any future operational issues at Norandas smelter plant like the revenue losses resulting from the January 2009 storm related power outage. As part of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, the Ameren Illinois Utilities entered into financial contracts with Marketing Company (for the benefit of Genco and AERG), to lock in energy prices for 400 to 1,000 megawatts annually of their round the clock power requirements during the period June 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012, at then relevant market prices. These financial contracts do not include capacity, are not load following products, and do not involve the physical delivery of energy. Under the terms of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, these financial contracts are deemed prudent, and the Ameren Illinois Utilities are permitted full recovery of their costs in rates. Volatile power prices in the Midwest can affect the amount of revenues Ameren, Genco, CILCO (through AERG) and EEI generate by marketing power into the wholesale and spot markets and can influence the cost of power purchased in the spot markets. Spot power prices in the MISO were lower in 2009 than in 2008 and should be significantly affected by any prospect of global economic recovery, among other things. With few scheduled maintenances outages in 2010 through 2012, the Merchant Generation segment expects to have available generation of 35 million megawatthours in each year. However, the Merchant Generation segments actual generation levels will be significantly 67 Table of Contents impacted by market prices for power in those years, among other things. The availability and performance of Gencos, AERGs and EEIs electric generation fleet can materially affect their revenues. The Merchant Generation segment expects to generate 30.5 million megawatthours of power from its coal fired plants in 2010 (Genco 15.6 million, AERG 7.4 million, EEI 7.5 million) based on expected power prices. Should power prices rise more than expected, the Merchant Generation segment has the capacity and availability to sell more generation. The marketing strategy for the Merchant Generation segment is to optimize generation output in a low risk manner to minimize volatility of earnings and cash flow, while seeking to capitalize on its low cost generation fleet to provide solid, sustainable returns. To accomplish this strategy, the Merchant Generation segment has established hedge targets for near term years. Through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts, Marketing Company targets to hedge Merchant Generations expected output by 80% to 90% for the following year, 50% to 70% for two years out, and 30% to 50% for three years out. As of January 31, 2010, Marketing Company had hedged approximately 26 million megawatthours of Merchant Generations expected 2010 generation, at an average price of $47 per megawatthour. For 2011, Marketing Company had hedged approximately 18 million megawatthours of Merchant Generations forecasted generation sales at an average price of $49 per megawatthour. For 2012, Marketing Company had hedged approximately 12 million megawatthours of Merchant Generations forecasted generation sales at an average price of $53 per megawatthour. Marketing Company has also entered into capacity only sales contracts for 2010, 2011, and 2012, resulting in expected capacity only revenues related to these contracts of $65 million, $45 million, and $15 million, respectively. Any unhedged sales will be exposed to relevant market prices at the time of the sale. The development of a capacity market in MISO could increase the electric margins of Genco, AERG and EEI. A capacity requirement obligates a load serving entity to acquire capacity sufficient to meet its obligations. MISO continues to refine its treatment of capacity supply and obligations, but development of a true capacity market could still be several years away. Current and future energy efficiency programs developed by UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP and others could result in reduced demand for our electric generation and our electric and natural gas transmission and distribution services. Our regulated operations will seek a regulatory framework that allows either a return on these programs or recovery of their costs. Fuel and Purchased Power In 2009, 83% of Amerens electric generation (UE 75%, Genco 99%, AERG 100%, EEI 100%) was supplied by coal fired power plants. About 96% of the coal used by these plants (UE 96%, Genco 99%, AERG 89%, EEI 100%) was delivered by rail from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. In the past, deliveries from the Powder River Basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail maintenance, weather, and derailments. As of December 31, 2009, coal inventories for UE, Genco, AERG and EEI were at targeted levels. Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause UE, Genco, AERG and EEI to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low margin periods, buying higher cost fuels to generate required electricity, or purchasing power from other sources. Amerens fuel costs (including transportation) are expected to increase in 2010 and beyond. As of December 31, 2009, Merchant Generations baseload hedged fuel costs, which include coal, transportation, diesel fuel surcharges, and other charges, had increased from an average cost of approximately $20.25 per megawatthour in 2009 to approximately $23.25 per megawatthour in 2010, $25.50 per megawatthour in 2011, and $26.50 per megawatthour in 2012. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report for additional information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for 2010 through 2014. Other Costs In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility. This resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which damaged a state park. UE settled with the FERC and the state of Missouri all issues associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident. UE has property and liability insurance coverage for the Taum Sauk incident, subject to certain limits and deductibles. Insurance does not cover lost electric margins or penalties paid to FERC. UE received approval from FERC to rebuild the upper reservoir at its Taum Sauk plant and is in the process of testing the rebuilt facility. UE expects the Taum Sauk plant to become operational in the second quarter of 2010. The estimated cost to rebuild the upper reservoir is in the range of $490 million. Under UEs insurance policies, all claims by or against UE are subject to review by its insurance carriers. In July 2009, three insurance carriers filed a petition against Ameren in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, seeking a declaratory judgment that the property insurance policy does not require these three insurers to indemnify Ameren for their share of the entire cost of construction associated with the facility rebuild design being used. The three insurers allege that they, along with the other policy participants, presented a rebuild design that was consistent with their insurance coverage obligations and that the insurance policies do not require these insurers to pay their share of the costs of construction associated with the design being used. These insurers have estimated a cost of approximately $214 million for their rebuild design compared to the estimated $490 million cost of the design approved by 68 Table of Contents FERC and implemented by Ameren. Ameren has filed an answer and counterclaim in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, against these insurers. The counterclaim asserts that the three insurance carriers have breached their obligations under the property insurance policies issued to Ameren and UE. The insurers that are parties to the litigation represent approximately 40%, on a weighted average basis, of the property insurance policy coverage between the disputed amounts of $214 million and $490 million. On August 31, 2009, Ameren and the property insurance carriers that are not parties to the above litigation reached a settlement of any and all claims, liabilities, and obligations arising out of, or relating to, coverage under its property insurance policy, including those related to the rebuilding of the facility and the reimbursement of replacement power costs. All payments from the settling insurance companies were received by UE in September 2009. Until Amerens remaining insurance claims and the related litigation are resolved, among other things, we are unable to determine the total impact the breach could have on Amerens and UEs results of operations, financial position, and liquidity beyond those amounts already recognized. Ameren and UE expect to recover, through insurance, 80% to 90% of the total property insurance claim for the Taum Sauk incident. Beyond insurance, the recoverability of any Taum Sauk facility rebuild costs from customers is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in UEs November 2007 State of Missouri settlement agreement. Certain costs associated with the Taum Sauk facility not recovered from property insurers may be recoverable from UEs electric customers through rates established in rate cases filed subsequent to the in service date of the rebuilt facility. As of December 31, 2009, UE had capitalized in property and plant qualifying Taum Sauk related costs of $99 million that UE believes qualify for potential recovery in electric rates under the terms of the November 2007 State of Missouri Settlement. The inclusion of such costs in UEs electric rates is subject to review and approval by the MoPSC in a future rate case. Any amounts not recovered through insurance, in electric rates, or otherwise, could result in charges to earnings, which could be material. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of Taum Sauk matters. UEs Callaway nuclear plants next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in the spring of 2010 is expected to last 35 days. During a scheduled outage, which occurs every 18 months, maintenance and purchased power costs increase, and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases, compared with non outage years. Over the next few years, we expect rising employee benefit costs, as well as higher insurance premiums as a result of insurance market conditions and loss experience, among other things. Other A ballot initiative passed by Missouri voters in November 2008 created a renewable energy portfolio requirement. UE and other Missouri investor owned utilities will be required to purchase or generate electricity from renewable energy sources equaling at least 2% of native load sales by 2011, with that percentage increasing in subsequent years to at least 15% by 2021, subject to a 1% limit on customer rate impacts. At least 2% of each portfolio requirement must be derived from solar energy. Compliance with the renewable energy portfolio requirement can be achieved through the procurement of renewable energy or renewable energy credits. Rules implementing the renewable energy requirement are expected to be issued by the MoPSC in 2010. UE expects that any related costs or investments would ultimately be recovered in rates. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional government regulation of derivative and OTC transactions and that would expand collateral requirements. Legislation of this nature, if finalized and signed into law by the President, could reduce the effectiveness of hedging, increasing the volatility of earnings, and could require increased collateral postings. In 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate each passed its own version of healthcare reform bills that would fundamentally change the U.S. healthcare system. Due to the uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal healthcare reform legislation, Ameren is unable to estimate the effects on any reform on its results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Resources Company, as part of an internal reorganization, transferred its 80% ownership interest in EEI to Genco, through a capital contribution, on January 1, 2010. In an attempt to improve access to capital, reduce financing costs, and enhance administrative efficiencies, among other things, several internal reorganizations are being considered. CILCO is evaluating the transfer of AERG to Genco, and the Ameren Illinois Utilities are exploring a merger whereby CIPS, CILCO and IP would become a single legal entity. These internal reorganizations could occur in 2010. The above items could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase Amerens stockholder value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed. The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. 69 Table of Contents REGULATORY MATTERS See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report. ACCOUNTING MATTERS Critical Accounting Estimates Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. These estimates involve judgments regarding many factors which in and of themselves could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. We have outlined below the critical accounting estimates that we believe are most difficult, subjective, or complex. Any change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results. Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery All of the Ameren Companies except Genco defer costs in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, and make investments that they assume will be collected in future rates. Regulatory environment and external regulatory decisions and requirements Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact Impact of deregulation, rate freezes, and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs Basis for Judgment We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or other factors that lead us to believe that cost recovery is probable. If facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is probably no longer recoverable or plant assets are probable of disallowance, we record a charge to earnings, which could be material. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for quantification of these assets by registrant. Unbilled Revenue At the end of each period, UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP project expected usage and estimate the amount of revenue to record for services that have been provided to customers but not yet billed. Projecting customer energy usage Estimating impacts of weather and other usage affecting factors for the unbilled period Estimating loss of energy during transmission and delivery Basis for Judgment We base our estimate of unbilled revenue each period on the volume of energy delivered, as valued by a model of billing cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class for our service area. This figure is then adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and weather variations based on historical results. See the balance sheets for each of the Ameren Companies, excluding Genco, under Part II, Item 8, of this report for unbilled revenue amounts. Derivative Financial Instruments We account for derivative financial instruments and measure their fair value in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance. The identification and classification of a derivative and the fair value of such derivative must be determined. See Commodity Price Risk and Fair Value of Contracts in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 8 Fair Value Measurements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Our ability to assess whether derivative contracts qualify for the NPNS exception. Amerens ability to consume or produce notional values of derivative contracts Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility and liquidity Valuation assumptions on longer term contracts due to lack of observable inputs Effectiveness of derivatives that have been designated as hedges Counterparty default risk 70 Table of Contents Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Basis for Judgment We determine whether to exclude the fair value of certain derivatives from valuation under the normal purchase and normal sales provisions of authoritative accounting guidance based upon our intent and ability to physically deliver commodities purchased and sold. Further, our forecasted purchases and sales also support our designation of some fair valued derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. Fair value of our derivatives is measured in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, which provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When we do not have observable inputs, we use certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation. Our valuations also reflect our own assessment of counterparty default risk, using the best internal and external information available. If we were required to discontinue our use of the normal purchase and normal sales exception or cash flow hedge treatment for some of our contracts, the impact of changes in fair value for the applicable contracts could be material to our earnings. Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long Lived Assets, and Asset Retirement Obligations We periodically assess the carrying value of our goodwill, intangible assets, and long lived assets to determine whether they are impaired. We also review for the existence of asset retirement obligations. If an asset retirement obligation is identified, we determine its fair value and subsequently reassess and adjust the obligation, as necessary. Managements identification of impairment indicators Changes in business, industry, laws, technology, or economic and market conditions Valuation assumptions and conclusions Our assessment of market participants Estimated useful lives of our significant long lived assets Actions or assessments by our regulators Identification of an asset retirement obligation and assumptions about the timing of asset removals Basis for Judgment Annually, or whenever events indicate a valuation may have changed, we use various methodologies we believe market participants would use to determine valuations, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples, and discounted, undiscounted, and probabilistic discounted cash flow models with multiple operating scenarios. The identification of asset retirement obligations is conducted through the review of legal documents and interviews. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for quantification of our goodwill, intangible assets, and asset retirement obligations. See Note 17 Goodwill under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information of our goodwill impairment evaluation. Benefit Plan Accounting Based on actuarial calculations, we accrue costs of providing future employee benefits in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance regarding benefit plans. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations Health care cost trend rates Timing of employee retirements and mortality assumptions Ability to recover certain benefit plan costs from our ratepayers Changing market conditions impacting investment and interest rate environments Basis for Judgment Our ultimate selection of the discount rate, health care trend rate, and expected rate of return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on our consistent application of assumption setting methodologies and our review of available historical, current, and projected rates, as applicable. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report for sensitivity of Amerens benefit plans to potential changes in these assumptions. Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report. 71 Table of Contents EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Amerens rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Nonretail electric rates are regulated by FERC. Adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that reviews a historical period. As a result, revenue increases will lag behind changing prices. Inflation affects our operations, earnings, stockholders equity, and financial performance. The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers. As a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years. Amerens Merchant Generation businesses do not have regulated recovery mechanisms and are therefore dependent on market prices for power to reflect rising costs. As a part of the electric rate order issued by the MoPSC in January 2009, UE was granted permission to put in place, effective March 1, 2009, a FAC. Historically, in UEs Missouri electric utility jurisdiction, there was no tariff for adjusting rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of purchased power. As part of its pending electric rate case, UE requested the MoPSC to approve the continued use of the FAC and implementation of an environmental cost recovery mechanism. The environmental cost recovery mechanism, if approved, would allow UE to adjust electric rates twice each year outside of general rate proceedings to reflect changes in its prudently incurred costs to comply with federal, state, or local environmental laws, regulations, or rules greater than or less than the amount set in base rates. Rate adjustments pursuant to this cost recovery mechanism would not be permitted to exceed an annual amount equal to 2.5% of UEs gross jurisdictional electric revenues and would be subject to prudency reviews by the MoPSC. UEs request was consistent with the environmental cost recovery rules approved by the MoPSC in April 2009. UE will not be able to implement an environmental cost recovery mechanism until so authorized by the MoPSC as part of a rate case proceeding. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on UEs pending electric rate case. CIPS, CILCO and IP recover power supply costs from electric customers by adjusting rates to accommodate changes in power prices. UE, CIPS, CILCO, and IP are affected by changes in the cost of electric transmission services. FERC regulates the rates charged and the terms and conditions for electric transmission services. Each RTO separately files regional transmission tariff rates for approval by FERC. All members within that RTO are then subjected to those rates. As members of MISO, UEs CIPS, CILCOs and IPs transmission rates are calculated in accordance with MISOs rate formula. The transmission rate is updated in June of each year based on FERC filings. This rate is charged directly to wholesale customers. The Ameren Illinois Utilities also charge this rate directly to alternative retail electric suppliers. For the Ameren Illinois Utilities retail customers who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier, the transmission rate is collected through a rider mechanism. This rate is not directly charged to Missouri retail customers because the MoPSC includes transmission related costs in setting bundled retail rates in Missouri. In our Missouri and Illinois retail gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. UE, Genco, and AERG are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent that they must purchase natural gas to run CTs. These companies have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins, and to minimize the impact to their financial statements. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, below for additional information. Also see Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on the cost recovery mechanisms discussed above. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument, derivative or nonderivative, caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates, commodity prices, and equity security prices. A derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value of some underlying asset. The following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. We handle market risks in accordance with established policies, which may include entering into various derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks, principally business, legal and operational risks, are not part of the following discussion. Our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets and to pursue market opportunities within prudent risk parameters. Our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee, which is composed of senior level Ameren officers. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with: long term and short term variable rate debt; fixed rate debt; and auction rate long term debt. 72 Table of Contents We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we have within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. The following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by 1% on variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2009: Interest Expense Net Income(a) Ameren(b) $ 12 $ (7 ) UE 2 (1 ) CIPS Genco CILCO 3 (2 ) IP (c ) (c ) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Includes intercompany eliminations. (c) Less than $1 million. The estimated changes above do not consider the potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would probably act to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted. Exchange traded contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the respective exchanges and have nominal credit risk. In all other transactions, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on the potential loss on counterparty exposure as of December 31, 2009. Our revenues are primarily derived from sales or delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and Illinois. Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and executory contracts with market risk exposures. The risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base. At December 31, 2009, no nonaffiliated customer represented more than 10%, in the aggregate, of our accounts receivable. The risk associated with the Ameren Illinois Utilities electric and natural gas trade receivables is also mitigated by a rate adjustment mechanism that allows the Ameren Illinois Utilities to recover the difference between their actual bad debt expense and the bad debt expense included in their base rates. UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities continue to monitor the impact of increasing rates and a weak economic environment on customer collections. UE and the Ameren Illinois Utilities make adjustments to their allowance for doubtful accounts as deemed necessary to ensure that such allowances are adequate to cover estimated uncollectible customer account balances. UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO, AERG, IP, AFS and Marketing Company may have credit exposure associated with interchange or wholesale purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2009, UEs, CIPS, Gencos, CILCOs, AERGs, IPs, AFS, and Marketing Companys combined credit exposure to nonaffiliated non investment grade trading counterparties was $2 million, net of collateral (2008 less than $1 million). We establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program. It involves daily exposure reporting to senior management, master trading and netting agreements, and credit support, such as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze each counterpartys financial condition before we enter into sales, forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts, and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged lease. We estimate our credit exposure to MISO associated with the MISO Energy and Operating Reserves Market to be $13 million at December 31, 2009 (2008 $46 million). Equity Price Risk Our costs for providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, including the rate of return on plan assets. Ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in ERISA. Amerens goal is to ensure that sufficient funds are available to provide the benefits at the time they are payable and also to maximize total return on plan assets and minimize expense volatility consistent with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment management to specialists in each asset class. Where appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio. Projected rates of return for each asset class were estimated after an analysis of historical experience, future expectations, and the volatility of the various asset classes. After considering the target asset allocation for each asset class, we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared with benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets. In future years, the costs of such plans reflected in net income, OCI, or regulatory assets, and cash contributions to the plans could increase materially, without pension asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 8%. UE also maintains a trust fund, as required by the NRC and Missouri law, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning. As of December 31, 2009, this fund was 73 Table of Contents invested primarily in domestic equity securities (67%) and debt securities (33%). It totaled $293 million (2008 $239 million). By maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk. However, the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. The debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options. UEs exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated, because UE is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs, which would include unfavorable investment results, through electric rates. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity, emission allowances, fuel, and natural gas. UEs, Gencos, AERGs and EEIs risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements. Genco, AERG and EEI also seek to sell power forward to wholesale, municipal, and industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices. We also attempt to mitigate financial risks through risk management programs and policies, which include forward hedging programs, and the use of derivative financial instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts, and financial swap contracts). However, a portion of the generation capacity of UE, Genco, AERG and EEI is not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices. The following table shows how our earnings might decrease if power prices were to decrease by 1% on unhedged economic generation for 2010 through 2013: Net Income(a) Ameren(b) $ (22) UE (7) Genco (8) CILCO (AERG) (3) EEI (6) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. Ameren also uses its portfolio management and trading capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy risk capital to generate additional returns. Due to our physical presence in the market, we are able to identify and pursue opportunities, which can generate additional returns through portfolio management and trading activities. All of this activity is performed within a controlled risk management process. We establish value at risk (VaR) and stop loss limits that are intended to prevent any negative material financial impact. We manage risks associated with changing prices of fuel for generation using techniques similar to those used to manage risks associated with changing market prices for electricity. Most UE, Genco and AERG fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts. Genco, AERG and EEI do not have the ability to pass through higher fuel costs to their customers for electric operations. Prior to March 2009, UE did not have this ability either except through a general rate proceeding. As a part of the January 2009 MoPSC electric rate order, UE was granted permission to put a FAC in place, which became effective March 1, 2009. UE remains exposed to 5% of changes in its fuel and purchased power costs, net of off system revenues. UE, Genco, AERG and EEI have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal to manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility. Price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures, whereby the amount of coal purchased is determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year. UE, Genco, AERG and EEI generally purchase coal up to five years in advance, but we may purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable deals or market conditions. The strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions. Transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs. UE, Genco, AERG and EEI typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility. Natural gas transportation expenses for Amerens gas distribution utility companies and the gas fired generation units of UE, Genco, AERG and EEI are regulated by FERC through approved tariffs governing the rates, terms, and conditions of transportation and storage services. Certain firm transportation and storage capacity agreements held by the Ameren Companies include rights to extend the contracts prior to the termination of the primary term. Depending on our competitive position, we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariff rates for our requirements. 74 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired power plants, nuclear fuel for UEs Callaway nuclear plant, natural gas for our CTs, and retail distribution, as appropriate, and purchased power needs of CIPS, CILCO and IP, which own no generation, that are price hedged over the five year period 2010 through 2014, as of December 31, 2009. The projected required supply of these commodities could be significantly affected by changes in our assumptions for such matters as customer demand for our electric generation and our electric and natural gas distribution services, generation output, and inventory levels, among other matters. 2010 2011 2012 2014 Ameren: Coal 97 % 61 % 15 % Coal transportation 100 93 40 Nuclear fuel 100 89 58 Natural gas for generation 73 8 Natural gas for distribution(a) 96 45 20 Purchased power for Illinois Regulated(b) 82 55 16 UE: Coal 98 % 61 % 14 % Coal transportation 100 100 44 Nuclear fuel 100 89 58 Natural gas for generation 89 11 Natural gas for distribution(a) 97 48 27 CIPS: Natural gas for distribution(a) 91 % 40 % 17 % Purchased power(b) 82 55 16 Genco: Coal 97 % 61 % 16 % Coal transportation 100 70 24 Natural gas for generation 100 19 CILCO: Coal (AERG) 97 % 63 % 18 % Coal transportation (AERG) 100 100 57 Natural gas for distribution(a) 93 47 20 Purchased power(b) 82 55 16 IP: Natural gas for distribution(a) 99 % 46 % 19 % Purchased power(b) 82 55 16 EEI: Coal 97 % 60 % 14 % Coal transportation 100 100 34 (a) Represents the percentage of natural gas price hedged for peak winter season of November through March. The year 2010 represents January 2010 through March 2010. The year 2011 represents November 2010 through March 2011. This continues each successive year through March 2014. (b) Represents the percentage of purchased power price hedged for fixed price residential and small commercial customers with less than one megawatt of demand. Larger customers are purchasing power from the competitive markets. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of the Illinois power procurement process and for additional information on the Ameren Illinois Utilities purchased power commitments. 75 Table of Contents The following table shows how our total fuel expense might increase and how our net income might decrease if coal and coal transportation costs were to increase by 1% on any requirements not currently covered by fixed price contracts for the five year period 2010 through 2014. Coal Transportation Fuel Expense Net Income(a) Fuel Expense Net Income(a) Ameren(b) $ 19 $ (12) $ 17 $ (10) UE 11 (7) 7 (4) Genco 4 (3) 6 (4) CILCO 2 (1) 1 (1) EEI 2 (1) 2 (1) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries. In addition, coal and coal transportation costs are sensitive to the price of diesel fuel as a result of rail freight fuel surcharges. If diesel fuel costs were to increase or decrease by $0.25/gallon, Amerens fuel expense could increase or decrease by $10 million annually (UE $5 million, Genco $2 million, AERG $1 million and EEI $2 million). As of December 31, 2009, Ameren had a price cap for approximately 93% of expected fuel surcharges in 2010. In the event of a significant change in coal prices, UE, Genco, AERG and EEI would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources. With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel, UE has both fixed priced and base price with escalation agreements. It also uses inventories that provide some price hedge to fulfill its Callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services. There is no fuel reloading scheduled for 2012. UE has price hedges for 75% of the 2010 to 2014 nuclear fuel requirements. Nuclear fuel market prices remain subject to an unpredictable supply and demand environment. UE has continued to follow a strategy of managing its inventory of nuclear fuel as an inherent price hedge. New long term uranium contracts are almost exclusively market price related with an escalating price floor. New long term enrichment contracts usually have some market price related component. UE expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the Callaway nuclear plant, at prices that cannot now be accurately predicted. Unlike the electricity and natural gas markets, nuclear fuel markets have limited financial instruments available for price hedging, so most hedging is done through inventories and forward contracts, if they are available. With regard to the electric generating operations for UE, Genco and AERG that are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run CTs, the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs. We optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins. Through the market allocation process, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP have been granted FTRs associated with the MISO Energy and Operating Reserves Market. In addition, Marketing Company has acquired FTRs for its participation in the PJM Northern Illinois market. The FTRs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission congestion charges related to the physical electricity business. Depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid, FTRs could result in either charges or credits. Complex grid modeling tools are used to determine which FTRs to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is a risk of incorrectly modeling the amount of FTRs needed, and there is the potential that the FTRs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges. With regard to UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs electric and natural gas distribution businesses, exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery mechanisms in place. These cost recovery mechanisms allow UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas supply costs. UEs, CIPS, CILCOs and IPs strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations for our regulated customers. The effects of price volatility cannot be eliminated. However, procurement strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier, as well as the management of physical assets. With regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for construction and maintenance activities, Ameren is exposed to changes in market prices for metal commodities and labor availability. See Supply for Electric Power under Part I, Item 1, of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal, nuclear power, natural gas, hydroelectric power, and oil. Also see Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Fair Value of Contracts We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, diesel, electricity, uranium, and emission allowances. Such price fluctuations may cause the following: an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sale prices under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices; market values of coal, natural gas, and uranium inventories or emission allowances that differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory; and actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that differ from anticipated cash outlays. 76 Table of Contents The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward contracts, futures, options, and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements. Contracts we enter into as part of our risk management program may be settled financially, settled by physical delivery, or net settled with the counterparty. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) changes in the fair value of all derivative contracts marked to market during the year ended December 31, 2009. We use various methods to determine the fair value of our contracts. In accordance with hierarchy levels outlined in authoritative accounting guidance, the sources we used to determine the fair value of these contracts were active quotes (Level 1), inputs corroborated by market data (Level 2), and other modeling and valuation methods that are not corroborated by market data (Level 3). All of these contracts have maturities of less than five years.
