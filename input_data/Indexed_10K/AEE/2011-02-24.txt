ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Ameren Executive Summary Operations During 2010, disciplined cost management, strong customer sales and rate relief allowed Ameren to overcome the financial impact of weak wholesale power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs. Ameren also returned its newly rebuilt Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility to service; installed major environmental controls at two coal fired plants; simplified its corporate structure by merging its Illinois delivery utilities into a single company and by moving AERG under Resources Company, where Amerens other Merchant Generation assets reside; launched plans for growing its transmission business; and improved its safety and customer satisfaction performance. In 2010, UE and AIC were authorized to increase rates. UE obtained approval from the MoPSC in May 2010 to increase electric rates by $230 million annually and then in February 2011 to increase natural gas rates by $9 million annually. These rate increases have been necessary to recover the cost of infrastructure investments, higher fuel costs, and other operating expenses. In November 2010, AIC received an order on rehearing from the ICC on issues arising from the ICCs amended order of May 2010. The rehearing order authorized an additional $25 million annual rate increase, bringing the total annual revenue increase to $40 million. Ongoing litigation exists surrounding appeals of certain aspects of UEs two most recent electric rate orders. In February 2011, the Missouri Office of Public Counsel (MoOPC) made a filing with the MoPSC in which the MoOPC argued that a December 20, 2010 stay, granted by the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri (Circuit Court), of UEs 2010 electric rate increase, as it applies to four industrial customers, should apply to all UE customers. UE disagrees with the MoOPCs argument. On December 20, 2010, the Circuit Court found that four industrial customers appealing UEs 2010 electric rate increase could pay the portions of their bills, representing increases from previously approved levels, into the Circuit Courts registry pending resolution of these appeals. This effectively stayed the rate increases for those parties. UE disagrees with the Circuit Courts ruling granting these industrial customers a stay. At this time, UE does not believe any aspect of the 2009 and 2010 electric rate increases authorized by the 2009 and 2010 Missouri electric rate orders are probable of refund to UEs customers. UE and AIC also have pending rate cases. In September 2010, UE filed for a $263 million annual electric rate increase. On February 8, 2011, other parties filed their initial testimony. The staff of the MoPSC recommended a rate increase of $45 million to $99 million. A key reason that the staffs recommendation is considerably lower than UEs request is the staffs use of a return on equity range of 8.25% to 9.25%, compared to UEs request of 10.9%. While UE strongly disagrees with elements of the MoPSCs staff and other parties initial recommendations, this case is still in its early stages with a decision not expected until July 2011. On February 18, 2011, AIC filed an electric and natural gas delivery rate case with the ICC requesting a $111 million aggregate increase in annual revenues. This request is based on a future test year ending December 31, 2012, with an ICC decision expected in January 2012. The use of a future test year is designed to better match AICs 2012 rate levels to its expected 2012 costs, reducing regulatory lag and providing an improved opportunity to earn a fair return on investment. In addition to these regulatory developments in Amerens state jurisdictions, Ameren is awaiting action from FERC on its August 2010 filing for pre approval of supportive rate treatment for its proposed Grand Rivers regional electric transmission projects. 2011 could be a pivotal year in environmental regulation. The EPA is scheduled to finalize its proposed CATR, which is aimed at reducing emissions of SO2 and NOx. Further, the EPA is scheduled to propose requirements for retrofitting power plants with MACT to reduce hazardous air pollutants such as mercury and acid gases, cooling water standards, and rules for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These rules are expected to impose additional costs that could be substantial to Ameren and, therefore, its customers. Ameren is continually evaluating these changing environmental standards for their impact on its power plants and is focused on meeting these requirements in the most cost effective manner possible. Ameren remains focused on earning fair returns on investments at its rate regulated utilities by seeking consistent, constructive regulatory outcomes, including mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag, like the use of a future test year in AICs pending electric and natural gas rate case filing. Further, Ameren continues to focus on disciplined cost management, including aligning its spending with the level of rates authorized by its regulators. In 2010, Amerens rate regulated utilities narrowed the gap between their core earnings and their allowed returns on equity by almost three percent and by more than one percent on a weather normalized basis. The projected 2011 return levels are expected to be below what is currently authorized and what Ameren considers appropriate. Ameren believes its pending rate cases, cost control efforts and its ongoing work to improve its regulatory frameworks will allow its rate regulated utilities to further narrow the gap between earned and allowed returns. Amerens Merchant Generation business continues to aggressively manage operating and capital costs so that this business remains stable during this period of low power prices and well positioned to benefit from an eventual expected power price recovery. In 2010, Amerens Merchant Generation business further lowered its cost structure to enhance its long term competitiveness. 32 Table of Contents Earnings Ameren reported net income of $139 million, or 58 cents per share, for 2010 compared with net income of $612 million, or $2.78 per share, in 2009. The main factor contributing to the decline in earnings in 2010 compared with 2009 was noncash goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $522 million, or $2.19 per share, recorded in 2010 related to Amerens Merchant Generation business. These charges reflected a decline in the value of Amerens Merchant Generation business, principally as a result of sustained lower power prices and the potential enactment of more stringent environmental regulations. Amerens earnings were also lower in 2010, compared with 2009, because of reduced Merchant Generation margins, as a result of lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs, and higher depreciation and amortization expense. Offsetting factors included higher electricity sales, which benefited from warmer summer weather, new utility rates in Missouri and Illinois, lower financing costs, and disciplined cost management. Liquidity Cash flows from operations of $1.8 billion were used to pay dividends to common stockholders of $368 million and to fund capital expenditures of $1.0 billion. At December 31, 2010, Ameren, on a consolidated basis, had available liquidity, in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under its existing credit facilities, of approximately $1.9 billion, which was equivalent to the amount of available liquidity at December 31, 2009. Capital Spending Capital expenditures decreased $673 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The reduction was a result of fewer planned expenditures for the distribution system and power plant improvements, less expenditures required to repair severe storm damage, and the completion of power plant scrubber projects in the Merchant Generation business during 2009 and early 2010. From 2011 through 2015, cumulative capital spending is projected to range between $6.4 billion and $8.2 billion. Much of this spending is at Amerens rate regulated utilities, including $265 million at ATX to expand its electric transmission assets. This five year plan also includes significant investments in environmental projects, including the cost of installing scrubbers for two units of Gencos Newton plant and for two units of a UE plant. In addition to existing laws and regulations governing our facilities, the EPA is developing numerous new environmental regulations that will have a significant impact on the electric utility industry. These regulations could be particularly burdensome for certain companies, including Ameren, UE and Genco, that operate coal fired power plants. Significant new rules already proposed or promulgated within the past year include the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions; revised ambient air quality standards for SO2 and NOx emissions increasing the stringency of the existing ozone ambient air quality standard; the CATR, which would require further reduction of SO2 and NOx emissions from power plants; and a regulation governing coal ash impoundments. Within the next year, the EPA is also expected to propose new regulations under the Clean Water Act, that could require significant capital expenditures such as new water intake structures or cooling towers at our power plants; NSPS and emission guidelines for greenhouse gas emissions applicable to new and existing electric generating units; and a MACT standard for the control of hazardous air pollutants, such as mercury and acid gases from power plants. Such new regulations may be challenged with lawsuits, so the timing of their ultimate implementation is uncertain. Although many details of these future regulations are unknown, the combined effects of the new and proposed environmental regulations may result in significant capital expenditures over the next five to eight years for Ameren, UE and Genco. General Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company under PUHCA 2005, administered by FERC. Amerens primary assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries. Amerens subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. These subsidiaries operate, as the case may be, rate regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution businesses, rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution businesses, and merchant electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Amerens common stock and the payment of other expenses by Ameren depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. Amerens principal subsidiaries are listed below. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed description of our principal subsidiaries. UE operates a rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution business, and a rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution business in Missouri. AIC operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. Genco operates a merchant electric generation business in Illinois and Missouri. Genco has an 80% ownership interest in EEI. On October 1, 2010, Ameren, CIPS, CILCO, IP, AERG and Resources Company completed a two step corporate internal reorganization. The first step of the reorganization was the AIC Merger, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, dated as of April 13, 2010. Upon consummation of the AIC Merger, the separate legal existence of CILCO and IP terminated. The second step of the reorganization involved the distribution of AERG stock from AIC to Ameren and the subsequent contribution by Ameren of the AERG stock to Resources Company. The AIC Merger and the distribution of AERG stock were accounted for as 33 Table of Contents transactions between entities under common control. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, assets and liabilities transferred between entities under common control were accounted for at the historical cost basis of the common parent, Ameren, as if the transfer had occurred at the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented. Amerens historical cost basis in AIC included purchase accounting adjustments related to Amerens acquisition of CILCORP in 2003. AIC accounted for the AERG distribution as a spinoff. AIC transferred AERG to Ameren based on AERGs carrying value. AIC determined that the operating results of AERG qualified for discontinued operations presentation; therefore, AIC has segregated AERGs operating results and presented them separately as discontinued operations for all periods prior to October 1, 2010, in this report. For Amerens financial statements, AERGs results of operations remained classified as continuing operations. See Note 16 Corporate Reorganization and Discontinued Operations under Part II, Item 8, for additional information. Ameren has various other subsidiaries responsible for the marketing of power, management of commodity risks, and provision of other shared services. Ameren has an 80% ownership interest in EEI, which until February 29, 2008, was held 40% by UE and 40% by Development Company. UE reported EEI under the equity method until February 29, 2008. Effective February 29, 2008, UEs and Development Companys ownership interests in EEI were transferred to Resources Company through an internal reorganization. UEs interest in EEI was transferred at book value indirectly through a dividend to Ameren. Effective January 1, 2010, as part of an internal reorganization, Resources Company transferred its 80% stock ownership interest in EEI to Genco through a capital contribution. The transfer of EEI to Genco was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, whereby Genco accounted for the transfer at the historical carrying value of the parent (Ameren) as if the transfer had occurred at the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented. Amerens historical cost basis in EEI included purchase accounting adjustments relating to Amerens acquisition of an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI in 2004. This transfer required Gencos prior period financial statements to be retrospectively combined for all periods presented. Consequently, Gencos prior period consolidated financial statements reflect EEI as if it had been a subsidiary of Genco. Ameren and Genco consolidate EEI for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14 Related Party Transactions under Part II, Item 8, for additional information. The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are expressed in millions, unless otherwise indicated. In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, we present certain information in cents per share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect Amerens earnings. We believe this per share information helps readers to understand the impact of these factors on Amerens earnings per share. All references in this report to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares outstanding. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations: winter heating and summer cooling demands. The vast majority of Amerens revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. This regulation has a material impact on the price we charge for our services. Merchant Generation sales are also subject to market conditions for power. We principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil for fuel in our operations. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the global economic and political environment, weather, supply and demand, and many other factors. We have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois and Missouri gas delivery service businesses, purchased power cost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois electric delivery service businesses, and a FAC for our Missouri electric utility business. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, for a discussion of pending rate cases in Missouri and Illinois. Fluctuations in interest rates and conditions in the capital and credit markets affect our cost of borrowing and our pension and postretirement benefits costs. We employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risk and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of our power plants and transmission and distribution systems and the level of purchased power costs, operations and maintenance costs, and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Earnings Summary Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation was $139 million, or $0.58 per share, for 2010, $612 million, or $2.78 per share, for 2009, and $605 million, or $2.88 per share, for 2008. 2010 versus 2009 Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation decreased $473 million and its earnings per share decreased $2.20 in 2010 compared with 2009. Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation increased in the Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois segments by $105 million and $81 million, respectively, in 2010 compared with 2009, while net income attributable to Ameren Corporation in the Merchant Generation segment decreased by $656 million in 2010 compared with 2009. 34 Table of Contents Compared with 2009 earnings per share, 2010 earnings were negatively affected by: the 2010 impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long lived assets within the Merchant Generation segment due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity, industry market multiples becoming observable at lower levels than previously estimated, and potentially more stringent environmental regulations ($2.19 per share); lower realized electric margins in the Merchant Generation segment largely due to lower realized revenue per megawatthour sold and higher fuel and related transportation costs (79 cents per share). This amount excludes the unfavorable impacts of net unrealized MTM activity on nonqualifying power hedges discussed below. See Outlook for expected trends in future coal, transportation and power prices; higher dilution (23 cents per share) caused by an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding, largely because of a September 2009 common stock issuance, the proceeds of which were used to make investments in Amerens rate regulated utilities. The impact of dilution was offset by higher earned returns on investments at Amerens rate regulated utilities and lower financing costs; costs associated with the Callaway nuclear plants scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in 2010. There was no Callaway refueling and maintenance outage in 2009 (12 cents per share); increased depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily due to capital additions placed in service at the Merchant Generation segment in late 2009 and early 2010, excluding the impacts at UE of the May 2010 MoPSC electric rate order discussed below (9 cents per share); a reduced gain between years from net unrealized MTM activity on nonqualifying power hedges and from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans (6 cents per share); and the impact of a federal tax change resulting from a U.S. health care reform bill that was enacted in 2010 (6 cents per share). Compared with 2009 earnings per share, 2010 earnings were favorably affected by: the impact of weather conditions on energy demand (estimated at 40 cents per share); higher UE electric rates pursuant to the MoPSC 2009 and 2010 electric rate orders effective March 1, 2009, and June 21, 2010, respectively, offset by the adoption of the life span depreciation methodology and increased regulatory asset amortization as directed by the MoPSC 2010 electric rate order (27 cents per share); the favorable impact on electric and natural gas margins in our rate regulated businesses from higher weather normalized sales volumes (exclusive of higher sales to Noranda discussed below), largely due to improved economic conditions and higher wholesale sales margins at UE because of additional customers and higher priced wholesale sales contracts, among other things (20 cents per share); increased UE sales to Noranda as its smelter plant gradually returned to full capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2010 after a January 2009 severe ice storm significantly reduced the plants capacity (11 cents per share); a reduction in financing expenses caused primarily by an increase in the allowance for funds used during construction at UE for the installation of two scrubbers at its Sioux plant (10 cents per share); higher AIC electric and natural gas net delivery rates pursuant to the ICC 2010 rate orders, which became effective in May and November 2010 (9 cents per share); and reduced charges in 2010 relating to workforce reductions through voluntary and involuntary separation programs (4 cents per share). The cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2009. 2009 versus 2008 Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation increased $7 million and its earnings per share decreased 10 cents in 2009 compared with 2008. Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation increased in the Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri segments by $92 million and $25 million, respectively, in 2009 compared with 2008, while net income attributable to Ameren Corporation in the Merchant Generation segment decreased by $105 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Compared with 2008 earnings per share, 2009 earnings were negatively affected by: higher dilution and financing costs caused by an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding, largely because of a September 2009 common stock issuance (31 cents per share); the impact on electric and natural gas margins in our rate regulated businesses of higher net fuel costs at UE resulting from higher coal and related transportation costs, and lower sales prices for excess power, and lower demand (exclusive of weather impacts), among other things (30 cents per share); the absence in 2009 of the benefit of a settlement agreement reached with a coal mine owner that reimbursed Genco, in the form of a lump sum payment, for increased costs for coal and transportation incurred in 2008 and 2009 due to the premature closure of an Illinois mine and contract termination (18 cents per share); the impact of milder weather conditions on energy demand (estimated at 15 cents per share); increased depreciation and amortization expenses primarily because of capital additions at UE and at the Merchant Generation segment and additional 35 Table of Contents amortization of UEs regulatory assets as a result of the MoPSCs January 2009 electric rate order (12 cents per share); reduced sales to Noranda after a January 2009 severe ice storm significantly reduced its smelter plants capacity (11 cents per share); the absence in 2009 of a MoPSC rate order establishing two separate regulatory assets for previously incurred storm and MISO related costs (11 cents per share); increased expense related to workforce reductions through voluntary and involuntary separation programs and long lived asset impairment charges recorded primarily at Genco in 2009 (7 cents per share); increased taxes other than income taxes, primarily because of higher property taxes (6 cents per share); lower realized electric margins in the Merchant Generation segment largely due to lower sales volumes and higher fuel and related transportation costs (5 cents per share); and increased distribution system reliability expenditures (5 cents per share). Compared with 2008 earnings per share, 2009 earnings were favorably affected by: higher AIC electric and natural gas delivery rates pursuant to an ICC rate order, which became effective on October 1, 2008 (40 cents per share); higher UE electric rates pursuant to a MoPSC rate order, which became effective on March 1, 2009 (40 cents per share); favorable net unrealized MTM activity on derivatives and from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans (21 cents per share); decreased plant operations and maintenance expense because less work was undertaken as a result of cost containment initiatives in response to weak economic conditions (15 cents per share); the absence in 2009 of a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage (9 cents per share); the absence in 2009 of asset impairment charges recorded to adjust the carrying value of AERGs Indian Trails and Sterling Avenue generating facilities to their estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008 (6 cents per share); and the reduced impact in 2009 of the electric rate relief and customer assistance programs provided to certain AIC electric customers under the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement (5 cents per share). The cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2008. For additional details regarding the Ameren Companies results of operations, including explanations of Margins, Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses, Goodwill and Other Impairment Losses, Depreciation and Amortization, Taxes Other Than Income Taxes, Interest Charges, and Income Taxes, see the major headings below. Because it is a holding company, Amerens net income and cash flows are primarily generated by its principal subsidiaries: UE, AIC and Genco. The following table presents the contribution by Amerens principal subsidiaries to Amerens consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: 2010 2009 2008 Net income (loss): UE(a) $ 364 $ 259 $ 245 AIC(b) 248 241 87 Genco (39 ) 160 286 Other(c) (434 ) (48 ) (13 ) Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation $ 139 $ 612 $ 605 (a) Includes earnings from a 40% interest in EEI through February 29, 2008. (b) Includes AERG for all periods prior to October 1, 2010, when AIC distributed AERG stock to Ameren. (c) Includes earnings from other merchant generation operations, as well as corporate general and administrative expenses, and intercompany eliminations. During 2010, Ameren Corporation, parent, and other nonregistrant subsidiaries recorded a $419 million impairment charge related to goodwill, long lived assets, and intangible assets in the Merchant Generation segment. 36 Table of Contents Below is a table of income statement components by segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008: 2010 Ameren Missouri Ameren Illinois MerchantGeneration Other /Intersegment Eliminations Total Electric margins $ 2,233 $ 1,096 $ 780 $ (17 ) $ 4,092 Natural gas margins 75 375 (2 ) 448 Other revenues 1 (1 ) Other operations and maintenance (931 ) (635 ) (287 ) 32 (1,821 ) Goodwill and other impairment losses (589 ) (589 ) Depreciation and amortization (382 ) (210 ) (146 ) (27 ) (765 ) Taxes other than income taxes (285 ) (128 ) (26 ) (10 ) (449 ) Other income and (expenses) 70 (6 ) 1 (8 ) 57 Interest charges (213 ) (143 ) (133 ) (8 ) (497 ) Income (taxes) benefit (199 ) (137 ) (6 ) 17 (325 ) Net income (loss) 369 212 (406 ) (24 ) 151 Noncontrolling interest and preferred dividends (5 ) (4 ) (3 ) (12 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Ameren Corporation $ 364 $ 208 $ (409 ) $ (24 ) $ 139 2009 Electric margins $ 1,983 $ 917 $ 1,012 $ (22 ) $ 3,890 Natural gas margins 73 373 446 Other revenues 4 4 (8 ) Other operations and maintenance (880 ) (590 ) (333 ) 35 (1,768 ) Goodwill and other impairment losses (7 ) (7 ) Depreciation and amortization (357 ) (216 ) (126 ) (26 ) (725 ) Taxes other than income taxes (257 ) (125 ) (28 ) (10 ) (420 ) Other income and (expenses) 56 2 1 (11 ) 48 Interest charges (229 ) (153 ) (119 ) (7 ) (508 ) Income (taxes) benefit (128 ) (79 ) (151 ) 26 (332 ) Net income (loss) 265 133 249 (23 ) 624 Noncontrolling interest and preferred dividends (6 ) (6 ) (2 ) 2 (12 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Ameren Corporation $ 259 $ 127 $ 247 $ (21 ) $ 612 2008 Electric margins $ 1,924 $ 837 $ 1,188 $ (47 ) $ 3,902 Natural gas margins 78 351 (4 ) 425 Other revenues 3 1 (4 ) Other operations and maintenance (922 ) (653 ) (342 ) 55 (1,862 ) Goodwill and other impairment losses (14 ) (14 ) Depreciation and amortization (329 ) (219 ) (109 ) (28 ) (685 ) Taxes other than income taxes (240 ) (126 ) (26 ) (12 ) (404 ) Other income and (expenses) 53 11 (15 ) 49 Interest charges (193 ) (145 ) (99 ) (3 ) (440 ) Income (taxes) benefit (134 ) (16 ) (217 ) 40 (327 ) Net income (loss) 240 41 381 (18 ) 644 Noncontrolling interest and preferred dividends (6 ) (6 ) (29 ) 2 (39 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Ameren Corporation $ 234 $ 35 $ 352 $ (16 ) $ 605 37 Table of Contents Margins The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) variations in the registrants electric and natural gas margins from the previous year. Electric margins are defined as electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. Natural gas margins are defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale. The table covers the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. We consider electric and natural gas margins useful measures to analyze the change in profitability of our electric and natural gas operations between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information we provide in accordance with GAAP. However, these margins may not be a presentation defined under GAAP, and they may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we provide elsewhere in this report. 2010 versus 2009 Ameren(a) UE AIC Genco Electric revenue change: Effect of weather (estimate)(b) $ 174 $ 134 $ 40 $ Regulated rates: Changes in base rates 203 162 41 Noranda sales 54 54 Illinois pass through power supply costs 220 (83 ) Energy efficiency programs and environmental remediation cost riders 29 29 Bad debt rider 14 14 Transmission services 49 7 42 Recovery of FAC net under recovery 60 60 Sales price changes, including hedge effect (243 ) (81 ) Off system revenues (102 ) (102 ) 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, net of reimbursement 23 10 10 Net unrealized MTM gains (losses) 49 (1 ) Sales (excluding impact of abnormal weather) and other 51 15 3 50 Total electric revenue change $ 581 $ 330 $ 96 $ (22 ) Fuel and purchased power change: Fuel: Production volume and other $ (138 ) $ (91 ) $ $ (38 ) FAC net under recovery 138 138 Recovery of FAC net under recovery (60 ) (60 ) Net unrealized MTM losses (51 ) (29 ) (18 ) Price Merchant Generation (71 ) (51 ) Purchased power 23 (38 ) 11 Illinois pass through power supply costs (220 ) 83 Total fuel and purchased power change $ (379 ) $ (80 ) $ 83 $ (96 ) Net change in electric margins $ 202 $ 250 $ 179 $ (118 ) Natural gas margins change: Effect of weather (estimate)(b) $ 1 $ $ 1 $ Bad debt rider 15 15 Rate decrease (11 ) (11 ) Energy efficiency programs and environmental remediation cost riders 1 1 Net unrealized MTM losses (6 ) (6 ) Sales (excluding impact of abnormal weather) and other 2 2 2 Net change in natural gas margins $ 2 $ 2 $ 2 $ 38 Table of Contents 2009 versus 2008 Ameren(a) UE AIC Genco Electric revenue change: Effect of weather (estimate)(b) $ (47 ) $ (33 ) $ (14 ) $ Regulated rates: Changes in base rates 229 141 88 Noranda sales (50 ) (50 ) Illinois pass through power supply costs (338 ) (338 ) Energy efficiency programs and environmental remediation cost riders 11 11 Sales price changes, including hedge effect 57 (48 ) Off system revenues (89 ) (89 ) 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement 15 5 7 Net unrealized MTM (losses) gains (110 ) 2 Sales (excluding impact of abnormal weather) and other (125 ) (25 ) (29 ) (235 ) Total electric revenue change $ (447 ) $ (56 ) $ (277 ) $ (274 ) Fuel and purchased power change: Fuel: Production volume and other $ 88 $ (17 ) $ 1 $ 93 FAC net under recovery, net of collections 38 38 Net unrealized MTM gains 118 58 48 Price Merchant Generation (83 ) (80 ) Coal contract settlement (27 ) (27 ) Purchased power (25 ) 48 18 25 Illinois pass through power supply costs 338 338 FERC ordered MISO resettlements (12 ) (12 ) Total fuel and purchased power change $ 435 $ 115 $ 357 $ 59 Net change in electric margins $ (12 ) $ 59 $ 80 $ (215 ) Natural gas margins change: Effect of weather (estimate)(b) $ (7 ) $ (1 ) $ (6 ) $ Changes in base rates 34 34 Absence of capitalization of nonrecoverable gas costs (5 ) (5 ) Energy efficiency programs and environmental remediation cost riders 4 4 Net unrealized 2008 MTM losses 12 12 Sales (excluding impact of abnormal weather) and other (17 ) (4 ) (17 ) Net change in natural gas margins $ 21 $ (5 ) $ 22 $ (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.

The following items had a favorable impact on Amerens electric margins: Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 52% increase in cooling degree days, which increased revenues by $174 million. Higher electric rates at UE, effective March 1, 2009, and June 21, 2010, which increased margins by $162 million. Increased UE sales to Noranda in 2010 as its smelter plant gradually returned to full capacity in March 2010 after a January 2009 severe storm significantly reduced the plants capacity, which increased revenues by $54 million. Higher transmission revenues primarily associated with higher FERC regulated transmission rates. Higher rates were due, in part, to a significant increase in transmission assets placed into service at AIC during 2009, higher equity levels as a result of Amerens capital contributions to AIC in 2009, and mild 2009 weather, which increased margins by $49 million. Higher electric rates at AIC, effective in early May 2010, as well as the adjustment of residential electric delivery rates effective October 1, 2009, to recover the full increase of IPs 2008 ICC rate order, which increased margins by $41 million. Net unrealized MTM activity at the Merchant Generation segment (primarily at Marketing Company), primarily related to nonqualifying power hedges, which increased margins by $49 million. Recovery of energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs through Illinois rate adjustment mechanisms at AIC, which increased margins by $29 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for information on a related offsetting increase in energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs. Excluding the impact of UEs increased sales to Noranda and the estimated impact of abnormal weather, rate regulated retail sales volumes increased 39 Table of Contents by 3% largely due to improved economic conditions, which increased margins by $25 million. A reduction in the impact of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, which increased margins by $23 million. Recovery of prior years bad debt expense through the Illinois bad debt rider at AIC effective March 2010, which increased revenues by $14 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for additional information on a related offsetting increase in bad debt expense. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Amerens electric margins for 2010 compared with 2009: Reductions in higher margin sales at the Merchant Generation segment resulting from the expiration of the 2006 auction power supply agreements on May 31, 2010, and lower market prices resulting in fewer opportunities for economic power sales, which decreased margins by $243 million. A $93 million increase in UEs net base fuel expense, which is substantially recovered from its customers, through higher sales volume associated with favorable weather in 2010 compared with 2009 and higher rates. Net base fuel expense is the sum of fuel production volume and other ($91 million), purchased power ($38 million), and off system sales ($102 million) offset by the FAC net under recovery ($138 million). 14% higher fuel prices in the Merchant Generation segment primarily due to higher commodity and transportation costs associated with new supply contracts, which decreased margins $71 million. In the first quarter of 2009, the reversal of previously unrealized losses related to regulatory assets resulted in the recognition of a $29 million net MTM gain on energy and fuel related contracts at UE. After the implementation of UEs FAC on March 1, 2009, UEs net MTM gains or losses no longer impact electric margins. Net unrealized MTM activity at the Merchant Generation segment on fuel related transactions, primarily associated with financial instruments that were acquired to mitigate the risk of rising diesel fuel price adjustments embedded in coal transportation contracts, which reduced margins by $20 million. Amerens Illinois pass through power supply costs reflect lower power prices and the expiration of intercompany power supply agreements between AIC and Marketing Company. AIC purchased power from Marketing Company from January 1, 2007, through May 31, 2010, under power supply agreements entered into following a 2006 Illinois power procurement auction. The purchases and sales under these agreements were eliminated in consolidation for Amerens financial statements. Subsequent to the expiration of these agreements in May 2010, Marketing Companys power sales and AICs power purchases have primarily been made with nonaffiliated parties. As a result, Amerens consolidated revenues increased by a net $220 million in 2010 compared with 2009. These revenues were offset by a corresponding $220 million net increase in purchased power costs. Amerens natural gas margins increased $2 million, or less than 1%, in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items had a favorable impact on Amerens natural gas margins: Recovery of prior years bad debt expense through the Illinois bad debt rider at AIC effective March 2010, which increased revenues by $15 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for additional information on a related offsetting increase in bad debt expense. Favorable higher margin customer mix that was mitigated by a 2% decrease in sales volumes, which increased margins by $2 million. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Amerens natural gas margins in 2010 compared with 2009: Lower natural gas rates effective early May 2010 at AIC, which reduced margins by $11 million. The absence of net unrealized MTM gains in 2010 of $6 million on natural gas swaps. Ameren Missouri (UE) UE has a FAC cost recovery mechanism that allows UE to recover, through customer rates, 95% of changes in fuel production volume and other costs and purchased power costs, net of off system revenues, including MISO costs and revenues, greater or less than the amount set in base rates, without a traditional rate proceeding. UEs electric margins increased $250 million, or 13%, in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items had a favorable impact on UEs electric margins: Higher electric rates, effective March 1, 2009, and June 21, 2010, which increased margins $162 million. Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 44% increase in cooling degree days, which increased revenues by $134 million. Increased sales to Noranda in 2010 as its smelter plant gradually returned to full capacity in March 2010 after a January 2009 severe storm significantly reduced the plants capacity, which increased electric revenues by $54 million. Taum Sauks return to service. Although Taum Sauk was not available to generate electricity for off system revenues during 2009, UE had included $19 million in the calculation of the FAC as if Taum Sauk had generated off system revenues. Upon Taum Sauks return to service in April 2010, UEs margins have increased since the adjustment factor was eliminated from the FAC calculation, which increased margins by $12 million. Excluding the impact of increased sales to Noranda and the estimated impact of abnormal weather, rate regulated retail sales volumes increased by less than 1%, largely due to improved economic conditions, which increased margins by $9 million. 40 Table of Contents The following items had an unfavorable effect on UEs electric margins in 2010 compared with 2009: A $93 million increase in net base fuel expense, which is substantially recovered from its customers, as a result of higher sales volume associated with favorable weather in 2010 compared with 2009 and higher rates. Net base fuel expense is the sum of fuel production volume and other ($91 million), purchased power ($38 million), and off system sales ($102 million) offset by the FAC net under recovery ($138 million). The reversal of previously unrealized losses to regulatory assets, which resulted in the recognition of a $29 million net MTM gain on energy and fuel related contracts in the first quarter of 2009. This benefit did not reoccur in 2010. After the implementation of the FAC on March 1, 2009, net MTM gains or losses no longer affect electric margins. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. UEs natural gas margins increased by $2 million, or 3%, in 2010 compared with 2009 because of a 2% increase in sales volumes, largely due to improved economic conditions. Ameren Illinois (AIC) AIC has a cost recovery mechanism for power purchased on behalf of its customers. These pass through power costs do not affect margins; however, the electric revenues and offsetting purchased power costs may fluctuate, primarily because of customer switching and usage. See below for explanations of electric and natural gas margin variances for the Ameren Illinois segment. AICs electric margins increased by $179 million, or 20%, in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items had a favorable impact on electric margins: Higher transmission revenues primarily associated with higher FERC regulated transmission rates. Higher rates were due, in part, to an increase in transmission assets placed into service during 2009, higher equity levels resulting from Amerens capital contributions to IP in 2009, and mild 2009 weather, which increased margins by $42 million. Higher delivery service rates, effective in early May 2010, as well as the adjustment of residential electric delivery rates effective October 1, 2009, at IP to recover the full increase of the 2008 ICC rate order, which increased margins by $41 million. Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 65% increase in cooling degree days, which increased revenues by $40 million. Recovery of energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs through Illinois rate adjustment mechanisms, which increased margins by $29 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for information on a related offsetting increase in energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs. Recovery of prior years bad debt expense under the Illinois bad debt rider effective March 2010, which increased revenues by $14 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for additional information on a related offsetting increase in bad debt expense. A reduction in the impact of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, which increased margins by $10 million. AICs natural gas margins increased by $2 million, or 1%, in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items had a favorable impact on natural gas margins: Recovery of prior years bad debt expense under the Illinois bad debt rider, effective March 2010, which increased revenues by $15 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for additional information on a related offsetting increase in bad debt expense. A higher margin customer mix that was mitigated by a 3% decrease in sales volumes, which increased margins by $2 million. The following items had an unfavorable impact on AICs natural gas margins in 2010 compared with 2009: Lower natural gas rates effective early May 2010, which reduced margins by $11 million. The absence of net unrealized MTM gains in 2010 of $6 million on natural gas swaps, as occurred in 2009. Merchant Generation Merchant Generations electric margins decreased by $232 million, or 23%, in 2010 compared with 2009. See below for explanations of electric margin variances for the Merchant Generation segment. Genco Gencos electric margins decreased by $118 million, or 18%, in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items had an unfavorable impact on electric margins: Lower revenues allocated to Genco under its power supply agreement (Genco PSA) with Marketing Company. There was a smaller pool of money to allocate because of reductions in higher margin sales, resulting from the expiration of older long term contracts and because of lower market prices. The lower market prices associated with the Genco PSA were mitigated by higher market prices associated with EEIs power supply agreement with Marketing Company (EEI PSA). The net impact of lower market prices under both power supply agreements reduced electric revenues by $81 million. In accordance with the Genco PSA, Genco was also allocated a lower percentage of revenues from the pool because of lower reimbursable expenses and lower generation relative to AERG. 14% higher fuel prices in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to higher commodity and transportation costs associated with new supply contracts, which reduced margins by $51 million. 41 Table of Contents Net unrealized MTM activity on fuel related transactions primarily associated with financial instruments acquired to mitigate the risk of rising diesel fuel price adjustments embedded in coal transportation contracts, which reduced margins by $18 million. The following items had a favorable impact on Gencos electric margins in 2010 compared with 2009: A reduction in the impact of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, which increased margins by $10 million. Increased power plant utilization, primarily due to more economic sales opportunities and a reduction in transmission constraints, which previously limited the period in which power could be sold. In addition, one of Gencos coal fired power plants experienced a transformer fire in September 2009, which put two units out of service for a period of time in 2009. The higher production volume contributed to the $50 million increase in electric revenues, which was mitigated by higher production volume costs of $38 million. Gencos baseload coal fired generating plants average capacity factor increased to 71% in 2010, compared with 67% in 2009, and Gencos equivalent availability factor increased to 88% in 2010, compared with 82% in 2009. Other Merchant Generation Electric margins from Amerens other Merchant Generation operations, primarily AERG and Marketing Company, decreased by $114 million, or 32%, in 2010. Other Merchant Generation electric margins were unfavorably affected, compared with 2009, by: Lower revenues allocated to AERG under its power supply agreement (AERG PSA) with Marketing Company. There was a smaller pool of money to allocate because of reductions in higher margin sales resulting from the expiration of older long term contracts and because of lower market prices. These items reduced electric margins by $109 million. However, in accordance with the AERG PSA, AERG was allocated a greater percentage of revenues from the pool because of higher reimbursable expenses and higher generation relative to Genco. 19% higher fuel prices at AERG in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to higher commodity and transportation costs associated with new supply contracts, which reduced margins by $20 million. The following items had a favorable impact on the electric margins of other Merchant Generation operations for 2010 compared with 2009: Net unrealized MTM activity at Marketing Company improved margins by $50 million primarily because of nonqualifying power hedges. A reduction in the impact of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement at AERG, which increased margins by $4 million. Increased power plant utilization at AERG, primarily due to more opportunities for economic sales and a reduction in plant outages. The higher production volume increased electric revenues by $37 million, which was partially offset by higher production volume costs of $16 million. AERGs baseload coal fired generating plants average capacity factor increased to 75% in 2010, compared with 69% in 2009, while AERGs equivalent availability factor increased to 85% in 2010, compared with 78% in 2009. 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Amerens electric margins decreased by $12 million, or less than 1%, in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Amerens electric margins: Net unrealized MTM activity in the Merchant Generation segment decreased margins by $110 million (Marketing Company net loss of $112 million and Genco net gain of $2 million), primarily related to nonqualifying power hedges. Higher fuel expense at Genco as a result of its June 2008 agreement with a coal mine owner to receive a lump sum payment of $60 million for the early termination of a coal supply contract. This payment compensated Genco, in total, for higher fuel costs it incurred throughout 2008 ($33 million) and 2009 ($27 million). Because the entire settlement was recorded in earnings in 2008, Amerens recorded earnings in 2009 were lower than they otherwise would have been. Excluding the impact of the June 2008 settlement agreement, 5% higher fuel prices in the Merchant Generation segment. Reduced sales by UE to Noranda, due to an extended severe storm related outage, which lowered electric revenues by $50 million in 2009. Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 7% reduction in cooling degree days, which decreased revenues by $47 million. Excluding the impact of UEs reduced sales to Noranda and the estimated impact of abnormal weather, rate regulated retail sales volumes decreased by 4% in Amerens rate regulated utilities, largely a result of the economic slowdown, which decreased margins by $40 million. Higher net fuel expense at UE of $20 million resulting from lower off system revenues and higher production volume and other, offset in part by lower purchased power and FAC under recovery. Decreased power plant utilization in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily because of lower market prices, which resulted in fewer opportunities for economic sales, and transmission congestion, which limited the period when power could be sold. The lower production volume contributed to the $125 million decrease in electric revenues, which was mitigated by 42 Table of Contents lower production volume costs of $88 million. Merchant Generations baseload, coal fired generating plants equivalent availability factors were 81% in 2009, compared with 85% in 2008. The average capacity factor was 66% in 2009, compared with 76% in 2008. The following items had a favorable impact on Amerens electric margins for 2009 compared with 2008: Higher electric rates at UE, effective March 1, 2009, which increased margins by $141 million, and higher rates at AIC, effective October 1, 2008, which increased margins by $88 million. Net unrealized MTM activity at UE improved margins by $58 million on energy and fuel related transactions. During 2009, UE reversed and deferred as regulatory assets previously recorded net MTM losses of $42 million on energy and fuel related transactions when these costs became probable of recovery because of the FAC. Net unrealized MTM activity improved margins by $55 million at the Merchant Generation segment (Genco $48 million, AERG $7 million). These were primarily associated with financial instruments acquired to mitigate the risk of rising diesel fuel price adjustments embedded in coal transportation contracts. The repricing of wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements and financial swaps that settled at higher margins at Merchant Generation. A $32 million increase in wholesale sales margins at UE because of additional customers and higher priced wholesale sales contracts. Power was available for sale to wholesale customers as a result of reduced native load demand. Recovery of energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs through Illinois rate adjustment mechanisms at AIC, which increased margins by $11 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for information on a related offsetting increase in energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs. A $15 million reduction in the impact of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement. Higher Callaway nuclear plant availability due to the absence of a 30 day planned maintenance outage, which occurred in 2008. Amerens natural gas margins increased by $21 million, or 5%, in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items had a favorable impact on Amerens natural gas margins: AICs net natural gas delivery service rate increase, effective October 1, 2008, which increased margins by $34 million. The absence of net unrealized MTM losses at AIC on natural gas swaps that improved margins by $12 million in 2009. Recovery of energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs through Illinois rate adjustment mechanisms at AIC, which increased margins by $4 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for information on a related offsetting increase in energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Amerens natural gas margins in 2009 compared with 2008: 7% lower sales volumes, excluding the estimated impact of abnormal weather, largely a result of the economic slowdown, and lower realized prices related to a contract with a large industrial customer in 2009, which decreased margins by $17 million. Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by an 8% reduction in heating degree days, which decreased margins by $7 million. The absence of the capitalization of nonrecoverable purchased gas costs in accordance with the September 2008 ICC gas rate order, which resulted in a one time increase in margins of $5 million in 2008. Ameren Missouri (UE) UE has a FAC cost recovery mechanism that allows UE to recover, through customer rates, 95% of changes in fuel production volume and other costs and purchased power costs, net of off system revenues, including MISO costs and revenues, greater or less than the amount set in base rates, without a traditional rate proceeding. UEs electric margins increased $59 million, or 3%, in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items had a favorable impact on UEs electric margins: Higher electric rates, effective March 1, 2009, which increased margins by $141 million. Net unrealized MTM activity on energy and fuel related transactions that improved margins by $58 million. During 2009, UE reversed and deferred as regulatory assets previously recorded net MTM losses of $42 million on energy and fuel related transactions when these costs became probable of recovery because of the FAC. A $32 million increase in wholesale sales margins due to additional customers and higher priced wholesale sales contracts. Power was available for sale to wholesale customers as a result of reduced native load demand. Higher Callaway nuclear plant availability due to the absence of a 30 day planned maintenance outage, which occurred in 2008. The following items had an unfavorable impact on UEs electric margins in 2009 compared with 2008: Reduced sales to Noranda, due to an extended severe storm related outage, which lowered electric revenues by $50 million. 43 Table of Contents Unfavorable weather conditions, as indicated by a 13% reduction in cooling degree days during the third quarter of 2009, which is UEs peak cooling period, and a mild winter, which decreased revenues by $33 million. Excluding the impact of reduced sales to Noranda and the estimated impact of abnormal weather, rate regulated retail sales volumes decreased by 2%, largely a result of the economic slowdown, which decreased margins by $25 million. A $20 million increase in net fuel expense resulting from lower off system revenues and higher production volume and other, offset in part by lower purchased power and FAC under recovery. The absence in 2009 of the benefits from a MoPSC order that directed the recording in 2008 of a regulatory asset related to previously incurred costs for a 2007 FERC order, which decreased margins by $12 million. UEs natural gas margins decreased by $5 million, or 6%, in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily because of an 8% decrease in sales volumes in 2009. Ameren Illinois (AIC) AIC has a cost recovery mechanism for power purchased on behalf of its customers. These pass through power costs do not affect margins; however, the electric revenues and offsetting purchased power costs may fluctuate, primarily because of customer switching and usage. See below for explanations of electric and natural gas margin variances for the Ameren Illinois segment. AICs electric margins increased by $80 million, or 10%, in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items had a favorable impact on electric margins: Higher electric delivery service rates, effective October 1, 2008, which increased margins by $88 million. Recovery of energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs through Illinois rate adjustment mechanisms, which increased margins by $11 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for information on a related offsetting increase in energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs. A $5 million reduction in the impact of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement. AICs electric margins were unfavorably affected in 2009 compared with 2008 by the following items: 5% lower sales volumes excluding the estimated impact of abnormal weather, primarily in the lower margin industrial customer sector, largely as a result of the economic slowdown, which decreased margins by $15 million. Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 13% reduction in cooling degree days, which decreased revenues by $14 million. AICs natural gas margins increased by $22 million, or 6%, in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items had a favorable impact on natural gas margins: Higher net natural gas delivery service rates, effective October 1, 2008, which increased margins by $34 million. The absence of net unrealized MTM losses on natural gas swaps that improved margins by $12 million in 2009. Recovery of energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs through Illinois rate adjustment mechanisms, which increased margins by $4 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for information on a related offsetting increase in energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs. The following items had an unfavorable impact on AICs natural gas margins in 2009 compared with 2008: 6% lower sales volumes excluding the estimated impact of abnormal weather, largely a result of the economic slowdown, and lower realized prices related to a contract with a large industrial customer in 2009, which decreased margins by $13 million. Unfavorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 7% reduction in heating degree days, which decreased margins by $6 million. The absence of the capitalization of nonrecoverable purchased gas costs in accordance with the September 2008 ICC gas rate order, which resulted in a one time increase in margins of $5 million in 2008. Merchant Generation Merchant Generations electric margins decreased by $176 million, or 15%, in 2009 compared with 2008. See below for explanations of electric margin variances for the Merchant Generation segment. Genco Gencos electric margins decreased by $215 million, or 25%, in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items had an unfavorable impact on electric margins: Decreased power plant utilization, primarily due to lower market prices, which resulted in fewer opportunities for economic sales, and transmission congestion, which limited the period when power could be sold. In addition, one of Gencos coal fired power plants experienced a transformer fire in September 2009, which put two units out of service for a time. The lower production volume contributed to the $235 million decrease in electric revenues, which was mitigated by lower production volume costs of $93 million. This contributed to a reduction in Gencos baseload coal fired generating plants equivalent availability factor to 82% in 2009, compared with 88% in 2008. Gencos average capacity factor also decreased to 67% in 2009, compared with 80% in 2008. 44 Table of Contents Lower revenues associated with EEIs power supply agreement with Marketing Company driven primarily by lower market prices, which decreased revenues by $191 million. Lower revenues allocated to Genco under the Genco PSA because of lower reimbursable expenses and lower generation relative to AERG in accordance with the Genco PSA, partially offset by financial swaps settling at higher margins and new higher priced wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements. These higher sales prices increased electric revenues by $143 million. Higher fuel expense as a result of Gencos June 2008 agreement with a coal mine owner to receive a lump sum payment of $60 million for the early termination of a coal supply contract. This payment compensated Genco, in total, for higher fuel costs it incurred throughout 2008 ($33 million) and 2009 ($27 million). Because the entire settlement was recorded in earnings in 2008, Gencos recorded earnings in 2009 were lower than they otherwise would have been. Excluding the impact of the June 2008 settlement agreement, 8% higher fuel prices. Gencos electric margins were favorably affected in 2009 compared with 2008 by the following items: Net unrealized MTM activity on fuel related transactions improved margins by $48 million. These were primarily associated with financial instruments acquired to mitigate the risk of rising diesel fuel price adjustments embedded in coal transportation contracts. A $7 million reduction in the impact of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement. Other Merchant Generation Electric margins from Amerens other Merchant Generation operations, primarily AERG and Marketing Company, increased by $39 million, or 13%, in 2009. Other Merchant Generation electric margins were favorably affected, compared with 2008, by: Higher revenues allocated to AERG under the AERG PSA because of higher reimbursable expenses and higher generation relative to Genco in accordance with the AERG PSA. AERGs baseload coal fired generating plants equivalent availability and average capacity factors were comparable to 2008. Financial swaps also settled at higher margins, and new higher priced wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements increased revenues. These items increased electric margins by $77 million. Net unrealized MTM activity at AERG on fuel related transactions increased margins by $7 million. These were primarily associated with financial instruments that were acquired to mitigate the risk of rising diesel fuel price adjustments embedded in coal transportation contracts. Lower oil consumption at AERG because of fewer plant startups and lower oil prices in 2009, which reduced costs by $6 million. A $3 million reduction in the impact of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement. Other Merchant Generation electric margins were reduced by $112 million in 2009 compared with 2008 by net unrealized MTM activity at Marketing Company. These were primarily associated with financial instruments that related to nonqualifying power hedges. Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $53 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items increased other operations and maintenance expenses between periods: Increased plant maintenance and labor costs of $39 million associated with a refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant and an increase of $16 million for other scheduled coal fired plant outages, the installation of scrubbers at UEs Sioux plant, and other maintenance work. There was no Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2009. A $46 million increase in bad debt expense. The July 2009 capitalization and recovery of prior years bad debt expense under the Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism (net of a related donation for customer assistance programs) reduced bad debt expense in 2009. Additionally, bad debt expense increased in 2010, because of amortization of regulatory assets set up in conjunction with the Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism in 2009. Amortization expense associated with these regulatory assets was offset by increased revenues through collection from customers, with no overall impact on net income. Increased AIC energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs of $30 million. Energy efficiency program costs are allowed to be recovered from customers under the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement; environmental remediation costs associated with MGPs are recoverable from customers through Illinois environmental adjustment rate riders. Accordingly, these costs are offset by increased revenues, with no overall impact on net income. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. An unfavorable change of $7 million in unrealized net MTM adjustments between periods, resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans. The following items reduced other operations and maintenance expenses between periods: The absence in 2010 of major storms, such as had occurred in 2009, which resulted in a $27 million 45 Table of Contents reduction in other operations and maintenance expenses. Severance costs of $17 million for employee separation programs recognized in 2009, as compared with $4 million in 2010. A May 2010 MoPSC electric rate order, which resulted in UE recording regulatory assets in 2010 related to employee severance costs and storm costs incurred in 2009, which decreased expenses by $11 million. A reduction in labor costs of $10 million, primarily because of staff reductions. Items that unfavorably affected Ameren in 2009 that did not recur in 2010: a $5 million penalty incurred for the termination of a heavy forgings contract associated with efforts to build a new nuclear unit at UEs Callaway nuclear plant and a $5 million write off of Amerens investment in a supply acquisition partnership. A gain on the sale of property interests at Genco recognized in 2010. Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Ameren Missouri (UE) Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $51 million in 2010. Plant maintenance and labor costs increased $39 million as a result of the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage and $34 million for other scheduled coal fired plant outages, the installation of scrubbers at UEs Sioux plant, and other maintenance work and plant related costs. Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses increased because of an unfavorable change of $4 million in unrealized net MTM adjustments between periods resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation and higher bad debt expense of $5 million, primarily due to higher customer billings resulting from rate increases and weather conditions. Reducing the unfavorable impact of these items was the absence of major storms, such as had occurred in 2009, which resulted in a decrease in other operations and maintenance expenses of $13 million. Other operations and maintenance expenses were also reduced by the recording of regulatory assets in 2010 related to employee severance costs and storm costs incurred in 2009, and by the absence of severance costs for employee separation programs and the absence of the forgings contract penalty recognized in 2009, as discussed above. Ameren Illinois (AIC) Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $45 million in 2010, primarily because of a $40 million increase in bad debt expense resulting from the July 2009 capitalization and recovery of prior years bad debt expense under the Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism (net of a related donation for customer assistance programs), which decreased bad debt expense in 2009, and the amortization in 2010 of regulatory assets set up in conjunction with the Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism in 2009. Energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs increased by $30 million, as discussed above. Reducing the unfavorable impact of these items were the absence of major storms in 2010, as compared with storm costs of $16 million in 2009, and a $9 million reduction of employee benefit costs due, in part, to the absence of severance costs in 2010 such as AIC had incurred in 2009. Merchant Generation Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $46 million in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily because of variations at Genco, as discussed below. Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased at AERG, primarily because of lower labor costs due to staff reductions, and reduced severance costs due to employee separation programs that were implemented in 2009. Genco Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $35 million. Plant maintenance costs were lower by $16 million due to the retirement in 2009 of two generation units at Gencos Meredosia plant and other reductions in required maintenance work between years. Additionally, other operations and maintenance costs were lower due to a $7 million reduction in employee benefit costs, due, in part, to reduced severance costs because of employee separation programs in 2009, a $5 million decline in labor costs resulting from staff reductions, and a property sale gain in 2010. 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Corporation Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $94 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items reduced other operations and maintenance expenses between periods: Coal fired plant maintenance costs were lower by $48 million, primarily because less work was undertaken as a result of cost containment initiatives in response to weak economic conditions. Bad debt expense was lower by $44 million because of the impact of the implementation of the Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism in 2009, as discussed above. Additionally, bad debt expense in 2008 was at an elevated level as a result of the transition to higher market based rates at AIC. A favorable change of $37 million in unrealized net MTM adjustments between periods resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans. The absence of a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2009, as compared with costs of $30 million in 2008. 46 Table of Contents The following items increased other operations and maintenance expenses between periods: In 2008, other operations and maintenance expenses were reduced by a MoPSC accounting order related to storm costs incurred in 2007, which resulted in UEs recording of a regulatory asset of $25 million; no similar item occurred in 2009. An increase of $24 million in labor costs due to wage increases and higher staff levels during most of 2009. The recognition of $17 million for employee severance costs in 2009. AICs energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs increased by $15 million. Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Ameren Missouri (UE) Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $42 million in 2009. This was primarily because of a $32 million reduction in coal fired plant maintenance costs due to reduced outages in 2009, as less work was undertaken as a result of cost containment initiatives in response to weak economic conditions, and because of the absence of a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2009, as compared with costs of $30 million in 2008. A favorable change of $19 million in unrealized net MTM adjustments between periods, which resulted from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans, also resulted in decreased expenses between years. In addition to these items, employee benefit costs were lower by $14 million, primarily due to reduced expenses between years associated with the pension and postretirement benefit costs tracker allowed by the MoPSC, partially offset by increased expense due to changes in actuarial assumptions. Reducing the benefit of these items was a $21 million increase in labor costs because of wage increases and higher staff levels during most of the year, the recognition of $8 million in employee severance costs in 2009, and the absence of the MoPSC storm cost accounting order of $25 million that occurred in 2008, as described above. In addition to these items, storm repair expenditures were higher in 2009 as a result of a severe ice storm at the beginning of the year. Ameren Illinois (AIC) Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $63 million in 2009, primarily because of a $39 million reduction in bad debt expense, due to the impact of the Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism (net of a related donation for customer assistance programs) and elevated levels of bad debt expense in 2008, as discussed above, and a favorable change in unrealized net MTM adjustments between periods resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs. Merchant Generation Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $9 million in 2009 in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily because of lower plant maintenance expenses at AERG. Gencos other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between years, as higher employee severance costs were mitigated by lower plant maintenance costs. The reductions in plant maintenance costs at AERG and Genco were a result of cost containment initiatives in response to weak economic conditions. Goodwill and Other Impairment Losses In 2010, Ameren and Genco recognized noncash pretax impairment charges of $589 million (including Gencos impairment charges) and $170 million, respectively, related to goodwill, long lived assets, and emission allowances within the Merchant Generation segment. In 2009, asset impairment charges of $7 million and $6 million were recorded at Ameren and Genco, respectively, primarily because of the termination of a rail line extension project at a subsidiary of Genco and to adjust the carrying value of an office building owned by Genco to its estimated fair value. In 2008, Ameren recognized asset impairment charges of $14 million to adjust the carrying value of AERGs Indian Trails and Sterling Avenue generation facilities to their fair values. See Note 17 Goodwill and Other Asset Impairments to our financial statements under Part lI, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Depreciation and Amortization 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased $40 million in 2010, as compared with 2009, because of items noted below at the Ameren Companies. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows. Ameren Missouri (UE) Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $25 million in 2010, primarily because of capital additions and an increase in UEs annual depreciation rate due largely to the adoption of the life span depreciation methodology as a result of the 2010 MoPSC electric rate order. Ameren Illinois (AIC) Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $6 million in 2010, primarily because of a reduction in amortization of regulatory assets. An ICC rate order in April 47 Table of Contents 2010 extended the amortization period of the IP integration related regulatory asset. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part lI, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Merchant Generation Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $20 million in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily because of variations at Genco, as discussed below. Genco Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $17 million in 2010, primarily because of capital additions and increased depreciation rates resulting from depreciation studies performed in 2009. 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Corporation Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased $40 million in 2009, as compared with 2008, because of items noted below at the Ameren Companies. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2009 and 2008 were as follows. Ameren Missouri (UE) Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $28 million in 2009, primarily because of capital additions and amortization of regulatory assets that resulted from UEs electric rate order in 2009. Ameren Illinois (AIC) Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between years. Merchant Generation Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $17 million in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily because of capital additions at AERG and variations at Genco, as discussed below. Genco Gencos depreciation and amortization expenses increased $6 million, primarily because of expense recorded in 2009 for the retirement of two generation units at its Meredosia power plant. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Taxes other than income taxes increased $29 million, because of items noted below at the Ameren Companies. Variations in taxes other than income taxes in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Ameren Missouri (UE) Taxes other than income taxes increased $28 million, primarily because of higher gross receipts taxes as a result of increased sales, and because of increased property taxes due to higher assessed tax rates in Missouri. Ameren Illinois (AIC) Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between years. Merchant Generation Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between periods at the Merchant Generation segment and at Genco. 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Corporation Amerens taxes other than income taxes increased $16 million in 2009, primarily because of higher property and payroll taxes. Variations in taxes other than income taxes in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2009 and 2008 were as follows. Ameren Missouri (UE) Taxes other than income taxes increased $17 million in 2009, primarily because of higher property taxes. Ameren Illinois (AIC) Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between years. Merchant Generation Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between years at the Merchant Generation segment and at Genco. Other Income and Expenses 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Miscellaneous income, net of expenses, increased $9 million in 2010, because of items noted below at the Ameren Companies. Variations in other income and expenses in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Ameren Missouri (UE) Miscellaneous income, net of expenses, increased $14 million in 2010, primarily because of higher allowance for equity funds used during construction associated with a project to install scrubbers at UEs Sioux plant, reduced, in part, by increased charitable contributions. 48 Table of Contents Ameren Illinois (AIC) AIC had net miscellaneous expense of $6 million in 2010, compared with net miscellaneous income of $2 million in 2009. Interest income decreased $5 million in 2010 compared with 2009 because CIPS note receivable from Genco matured on May 1, 2010. Merchant Generation Other income and expenses were comparable between years at the Merchant Generation segment and at Genco. 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Corporation Other income and expenses were comparable in 2009 and 2008. Miscellaneous expenses decreased as expenses associated with energy efficiency and customer assistance programs under the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement were lower in 2009. However, miscellaneous income declined because of reduced interest income, partially offset by increased allowance for equity funds used during construction. Variations in other income and expenses in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Ameren Missouri (UE) Other income and expenses were comparable between years. Ameren Illinois (AIC) Miscellaneous income, net of expenses, decreased $9 million, primarily because of lower interest income. Reduced expenses associated with energy efficiency and customer assistance programs under the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement mitigated this decrease. Merchant Generation Other income and expenses were comparable between years at the Merchant Generation segment and at Genco. Interest Charges 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Interest charges decreased $11 million in 2010, because of items noted below at the Ameren Companies. The decreases below were mitigated by additional interest charges resulting from the issuance of $425 million of senior notes by Ameren in May 2009. Variations in interest charges in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows. Ameren Missouri (UE) Interest charges decreased $16 million in 2010. Interest charges were reduced by $10 million because of a May 2010 MoPSC electric rate order, which resulted in UE recording a regulatory asset for recovery of bank credit facility fees incurred in 2009. Additionally, interest charges were reduced by an increase in allowance for borrowed funds used during construction associated with a project to install scrubbers at UEs Sioux plant. Partially reducing the above benefits was an increase in interest charges associated with the issuance of $350 million of senior secured notes in March 2009. Ameren Illinois (AIC) Interest charges decreased $10 million in 2010, primarily because of the maturity of $250 million of first mortgage bonds in June 2009. Merchant Generation Interest charges increased $14 million in 2010 in the Merchant Generation segment and $17 million at Genco, primarily because of the issuance of $250 million of senior unsecured notes at Genco in November 2009. 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Corporation Amerens interest charges increased $68 million in 2009, because of items noted below at the Ameren Companies and because of the issuance of $425 million of senior notes at Ameren in May 2009. Variations in interest charges in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Ameren Missouri (UE) Interest charges increased $36 million in 2009, primarily because of the issuance of $350 million, $450 million, and $250 million of senior secured notes in March 2009, June 2008, and April 2008, respectively. The amortization of fees related to credit facilities entered into in the second quarter of 2009 also increased interest charges. Additionally, a reversal in interest charges previously accrued on uncertain tax positions due to favorable income tax settlements in 2008, with no similar item in 2009, had a negative impact on 2009. The maturity of $148 million of first mortgage bonds in May 2008 and refinancing of auction rate environmental improvement revenue bonds in 2008, along with a reduction of short term borrowings, mitigated the impact of the above items. Ameren Illinois (AIC) Interest charges increased $8 million in 2009, primarily because of the issuance of senior secured notes of $150 million at CILCO in December 2008 at a higher rate than the short term borrowings it refinanced, and because of the amortization of fees related to a credit facility entered into in the second quarter of 2009. Increased interest charges resulting from the issuance at IP of senior secured notes of $400 million and $337 million in October 2008 and 49 Table of Contents April 2008, respectively, were mitigated as the proceeds of these issuances were used to refinance auction rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds, which bore default rates ranging from 12% to 18%, and to reduce short term borrowings. Merchant Generation Interest charges increased $20 million in 2009 in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily because of increased intercompany borrowings at AERG and amortization of fees related to new credit facilities entered into in the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, interest charges increased because of variations at Genco, as discussed below. Genco Interest charges increased $6 million in 2009, because of the issuance of $300 million of senior unsecured notes in April 2008. Income Taxes The following table presents effective income tax rates for the registrants and by segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008: 2010 2009 2008 Ameren 68 %(a) 35 % 34 % UE 35 33 36 AIC 39 37 28 Genco (b ) 38 37 Merchant Generation (c ) 38 36 (a) The effective tax rate was 36% for 2010, after excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. (b) The effective tax rate was 40% for 2010, after excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. (c) The effective tax rate was 30% for 2010, after excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Amerens effective tax rate in 2010 was higher than 2009, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the goodwill impairment charge recognized in 2010 at Ameren. Goodwill impairment charges are not deductible for income tax purposes. In addition, legislation was enacted in the first quarter of 2010 that resulted in retiree health care costs no longer being deductible for tax purposes to the extent an employers postretirement health care plan receives federal subsidies that provide retiree prescription drug benefits equivalent to Medicare prescription drug benefits. See Note 17 Goodwill and Other Asset Impairments under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on the goodwill impairment charges. Additional variations are discussed below. Variations in effective tax rates for Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows. Ameren Missouri (UE) UEs effective tax rate was higher, primarily because of the change in tax treatment of retiree health care costs, along with the decreased impact of favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities and other permanent items on higher pretax book income. Ameren Illinois (AIC) The effective tax rate was higher, primarily because of the decreased impact of favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities and permanent items on higher pretax book income. Merchant Generation The effective tax rate was lower in the Merchant Generation segment, because of items detailed below at Genco, partially offset by the impact of state tax credits related to capital investments and decreased Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions on a pretax book loss. Genco The effective tax rate increased, after excluding the impact of the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge, primarily because of the change in tax treatment of retiree health care costs and changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions mitigated by the increased impact of state tax credits, Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions and investment tax credit amortization on lower pretax book income. 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Corporation Amerens effective tax rate in 2009 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2008 because of variations discussed below. Variations in effective tax rates for Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2009 and 2008 were as follows. Ameren Missouri (UE) UEs effective tax rate was lower, primarily because of higher favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities, partially mitigated by changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions. Ameren Illinois (AIC) The effective tax rate was higher, primarily because of the decreased impact of net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities, investment tax credit amortization, and permanent items on higher pretax book income. 50 Table of Contents Merchant Generation The effective tax rate was higher at the Merchant Generation segment because of items detailed below at Genco, along with the impact of deferred tax adjustments due to changes in state apportionment. Genco The effective tax rate increased, primarily because of the decreased impact of Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions, along with changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Ameren Illinois (AIC) On October 1, 2010, Ameren, CIPS, CILCO, IP, AERG and Resources Company completed a two step corporate internal reorganization. The first step of the reorganization was the AIC Merger. The second step of the reorganization involved the distribution of AERG stock from AIC to Ameren and the subsequent contribution by Ameren of the AERG stock to Resources Company. AIC determined that the operating results of AERG qualified for discontinued operations presentation. We have therefore segregated AERGs operating results and presented them separately as discontinued operations for all periods in this report. For Amerens financial statements, AERGs results of operation remain classified as continuing operations. See Note 16 Corporate Reorganization and Discontinued Operations under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. AICs income from discontinued operations (AERG) decreased $74 million in 2010, compared with 2009. AERGs results of operations were included in AICs consolidated statement of income for all periods prior to October 1, 2010. The inclusion of only nine months in 2010 contributed to the decrease in income from discontinued operations as well as a decrease in electric margins caused by lower realized revenue per megawatt sold and higher fuel and related transportation costs. The decrease was partially offset by a reduction in income tax expense primarily caused by lower pretax book income. AICs income from discontinued operations (AERG) increased $62 million in 2009, compared with 2008. The increase in income from discontinued operations was caused by a $94 million increase in AERGs electric margins during 2009, compared with 2008, primarily because of higher revenues allocated to AERG under its power supply agreement with Marketing Company as a result of higher reimbursable expenses and higher generation relative to Genco in accordance with the AERG PSA. Additionally, AERGs other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $22 million, primarily because of a $9 million reduction in plant maintenance costs and an $11 million reduction in asset impairment charges. Factors reducing income from discontinued operations (AERG) included a $30 million increase in income tax expense primarily because of higher pretax book income, a $12 million increase in interest charges primarily because of increased intercompany borrowings, and an $11 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses primarily because of capital additions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The tariff based gross margins of Amerens rate regulated utility operating companies continue to be a principal source of cash from operating activities for Ameren and its rate regulated subsidiaries. A diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate regulated residential, commercial, and industrial classes and a commodity mix of natural gas and electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows for Ameren, UE and AIC. For operating cash flows, Marketing Company sells power through primarily market based contracts with wholesale and retail customers. In addition to using cash flows from operating activities, the Ameren Companies use available cash, credit facility borrowings, commercial paper issuances, money pool borrowings, or other short term borrowings from affiliates to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements. The Ameren Companies may reduce their credit facility or short term borrowings with cash from operations or, at their discretion, with long term borrowings or, in the case of Ameren subsidiaries, with equity infusions from Ameren. The Ameren Companies expect to incur significant capital expenditures over the next five years as they comply with environmental regulations and make significant investments in their electric and natural gas utility infrastructure to improve overall system reliability. Ameren intends to finance those capital expenditures and investments with a blend of equity and debt so that it maintains a capital structure in its rate regulated businesses of approximately 50% to 55% equity. The Ameren Companies plan to implement their long term financing plans for debt, equity, or equity linked securities in order to finance their operations appropriately, meet scheduled debt maturities, and maintain financial strength and flexibility. The following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities Net Cash (Used In) Investing Activities Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Ameren(a) $ 1,842 $ 1,977 $ 1,524 $ (1,112 ) $ (1,789 ) $ (2,097 ) $ (807 ) $ 342 $ 310 UE 978 972 543 (706 ) (955 ) (1,033 ) (337 ) 250 305 AIC 597 859 488 (257 ) (452 ) (577 ) (324 ) (151 ) 103 Genco 280 253 421 (29 ) (389 ) (366 ) (251 ) 139 (54 ) (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. 51 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Amerens cash from operating activities decreased in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items contributed to the decrease in cash from operating activities during 2010, compared with 2009: A $116 million decrease in billed revenues, net of payments to suppliers, for pass through natural gas commodity costs primarily caused by higher priced natural gas injected into storage during 2008 and billed to customers in 2009. Accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances increased by $106 million, primarily because of higher utility rates and colder December weather in 2010, compared with December 2009. Deferred FAC costs increased $100 million as net base fuel costs incurred at UE exceeded the amounts allowed in base rates due to higher fuel costs and lower off system sales as a result of warmer weather increasing native load demand. Deferred budget billing balances increased by $74 million, partially as a result of warmer summer weather, which increased sales volumes over budget billed amounts. An overall $56 million increase in collateral posted with counterparties due, in part, to the items discussed at the subsidiaries below, offset by a $105 million reduction in collateral posted by nonregistrant subsidiaries, primarily due to changes in the market price of power. A $53 million decrease in cash from operating activities associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident, primarily as a result of reduced insurance recoveries. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional Taum Sauk information. A $39 million increase in payments related to the Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage that occurred in 2010, but did not occur in 2009. A $14 million increase in payments associated with major outages at coal fired plants, primarily at UE. A $12 million increase in property tax payments caused primarily by higher assessed tax rates in Missouri. A $10 million one time donation in 2010 for customer assistance programs required by the 2009 Illinois energy legislation that authorized the bad debt rate adjustment mechanism and was approved by the ICC in February 2010. Payments for professional services, additional franchise taxes, and other administrative items necessary to complete the AIC Merger and AERG distribution totaled $8 million. The following items reduced the decrease in Amerens cash from operating activities during 2010, compared with 2009: Electric and natural gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, increased by $212 million, excluding impacts of MTM transactions. Income tax refunds of $92 million in 2010, compared with income tax payments of $9 million in 2009. The refund primarily resulted from an acceleration of depreciation deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation. Ameren reduced its coal inventory levels, primarily at the Merchant Generation segment, in 2010. The impact of the inventory reduction is estimated to have resulted in cash savings of $69 million in 2010. A $32 million decrease in major storm restoration costs. Contributions to the pension and postretirement plans were $31 million lower in 2010. A $14 million reduction in severance payments as a result of the voluntary and involuntary separation programs initiated in both years. UE UEs cash from operating activities increased in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items contributed to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2010, compared with 2009: Higher electric and natural gas margins as discussed in Results of Operations including the benefit of MoPSC approved electric rate increases effective on March 1, 2009, and June 21, 2010, as well as favorable weather conditions. Margins increased by $281 million, excluding the impacts of MTM transactions. A $31 million reduction in collateral posted with counterparties due in part to improved credit ratings and to changes in the market price of power and natural gas. A $13 million decrease in major storm restoration costs. Contributions to the pension and postretirement plans were $8 million lower in 2010. A $5 million reduction in severance payments as a result of the voluntary and involuntary separation programs initiated in both years. The following items reduced the increase in UEs cash from operating activities during 2010, compared with 2009: A $102 million decrease in income tax refunds, primarily due to higher pretax book income and a reduction in 2010 of the benefit of a change in tax treatment of electric generation plant expenditures taken in 2009. Deferred FAC costs increased $100 million as net base fuel costs incurred at UE exceeded the amounts allowed in base rates due to higher fuel costs and lower off system sales as a result of warmer weather increasing native load demand. 52 Table of Contents A $53 million decrease in cash from operating activities associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident discussed above. A $39 million increase in payments related to a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage that occurred in 2010, but did not occur in 2009. A $24 million increase in payments associated with major outages at coal fired plants. A $12 million increase in property tax payments, caused primarily by higher assessed tax rates. AIC AICs cash from operating activities associated with continuing operations decreased in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items contributed to the decrease in cash from operating activities associated with continuing operations during 2010, compared with 2009: A $192 million increase in collateral posted with counterparties due, in part, to changes in the market price of natural gas and collateral posting requirements. Accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances increased by $183 million, primarily because of higher utility rates and colder December weather in 2010, compared with December 2009. A $98 million decrease in billed revenue, net of payments to suppliers, for pass through natural gas commodity costs primarily caused by higher priced natural gas injected into storage during 2008 and billed to customers in 2009. Deferred budget billing balances increased by $60 million, partially as a result of warmer summer weather, which increased sales volumes over budget billed amounts. A $10 million one time donation in 2010 for customer assistance programs required by the 2009 Illinois legislation that authorized the bad debt rate adjustment mechanism and was approved by the ICC in February 2010. Payments for professional services, additional franchise taxes, and other administrative items necessary to complete the AIC Merger and AERG distribution, which totaled $7 million. In 2009, AIC received $5 million from Marketing Company for the costs of upgrades to AICs electric transmission system. There was no such receipt in 2010. The following items reduced the decrease in AICs cash from operating activities associated with continuing operations during 2010, compared with 2009: Electric and natural gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, increased by $187 million, excluding the impacts of MTM transactions. Income tax refunds of $52 million in 2010, compared with income tax payments of $61 million in 2009. The refund primarily resulted from an acceleration of depreciation deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation. A $19 million decrease in major storm restoration costs. Contributions to the pension and postretirement plans were $11 million lower in 2010. A $6 million decrease in interest payments, primarily due to the first mortgage bond maturity in June 2009. AICs cash from operating activities associated with discontinued operations decreased in 2010 compared with 2009. AERGs cash flows were included in AICs consolidated statement of cash flows for all periods prior to October 1, 2010. The inclusion of only nine months in 2010 was the primary cause of the decrease in cash flows, along with a reduction in receipts from Marketing Company under the AERG PSA primarily due to lower market prices, as discussed in Results of Operations. A decrease in income tax payments, primarily due to lower pretax book income, and an acceleration of depreciation deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation partially offset the decrease in AERGs operating cash flows. Genco Gencos cash from operating activities increased in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items contributed to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2010, compared with 2009: A $73 million decrease in income tax payments, primarily due to lower pretax book income, deductions relating to environmental expenditures, and an acceleration of depreciation deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation. Reduced coal inventory levels in 2010, which are estimated to have resulted in cash savings of $50 million in 2010. Lower labor expenditures resulting from staff reductions and fewer major outages at its coal fired plants. A $7 million reduction in use tax payments as Genco and EEI began claiming tax exemptions and credits for purchase transactions related to their generation operations. Contributions to the pension plans were $6 million lower in 2010. The following items reduced the increase in Gencos cash from operating activities during 2010, compared with 2009: Electric margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, decreased by $99 million, excluding impacts of MTM transactions. A $13 million increase in interest payments, primarily due to the senior unsecured notes issued in November 2009, which required interest payments in 2010, but not in 2009. 2009 versus 2008 Ameren Corporation Amerens cash from operating activities increased in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items contributed 53 Table of Contents to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008: A $256 million increase in cash from operating activities associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident. The increase was a result of a $65 million increase in insurance recoveries and a $191 million reduction in payments compared with 2008. During 2009, UE received a property insurance settlement payment from all but three of the property insurance carriers. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information about the Taum Sauk incident. A $198 million decrease in payments for natural gas injections into storage because of lower prices. A $97 million decrease in income tax payments primarily at UE. The over collected deferred budget billing balance increased by $27 million, partially caused by a reduction in commodity costs and a decrease in sales volumes compared to budgeted billed amounts. Less cash used for operations and maintenance activities, because many plant related projects were reduced, deferred, or cancelled and because of the absence of a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2009. The following items reduced the increase in Amerens cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008: A $75 million increase in interest payments, primarily due to the payments at the subsidiaries discussed below and Amerens senior secured notes issued in May 2009, which required an interest payment in 2009, but not in 2008. A decrease in natural gas costs over recovered from customers under the PGA. A $35 million increase in pension and postretirement plan contributions. Lower electric margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, including the absence in 2009 of the 2008 lump sum settlement payment received by Genco from a coal mine owner for the early termination of a coal supply contract. A $21 million decrease in customer advances for construction. The 2009 voluntary and involuntary separation programs, which resulted in severance payments of $16 million. An increase in annual incentive compensation payments. An $8 million increase in cash payments for major storm restoration costs. UE UEs cash from operating activities increased in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items contributed to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008: Income tax refunds of $208 million in 2009 compared with income tax payments of $130 million in 2008. The significant change in income taxes was primarily a result of an acceleration of deductions due to economic stimulus legislation and a change in tax treatment of electric generation plant expenditures. A $256 million increase in cash from operating activities associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident, as discussed above. A $20 million decrease in payments for natural gas injections into storage because of lower prices. Higher electric margins as discussed in Results of Operations. An increase in natural gas costs over recovered from customers under the PGA. Less cash used for operations and maintenance activities, because several plant related projects were reduced, deferred, or cancelled and because of the absence of a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in 2009. The following items reduced the increase in UEs cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008: The collection of an $85 million affiliate receivable in 2008 that did not occur in 2009. A $39 million increase in interest payments, primarily due to the senior secured notes issued in April 2008, June 2008, and March 2009. A $16 million increase in pension and other postretirement plan contributions. A $10 million increase in energy efficiency expenditures for new customer programs. A $6 million increase in major storm restoration costs. The 2009 voluntary and involuntary separation programs, which resulted in severance payments of $6 million. AIC AICs cash from operating activities associated with continuing operations increased in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items contributed to the increase in cash from operating activities associated with continuing operations during 2009, compared with 2008: A $178 million decrease in payments for natural gas injections into storage because of lower prices. A $176 million net reduction in collateral posted with suppliers due in part to improved credit ratings. Higher electric and natural gas margins as discussed in Results of Operations. Accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances decreased by $167 million, primarily because of milder weather and lower natural gas commodity costs. The over collected deferred budget billing balance increased by $44 million, partially caused by a reduction in commodity costs and a decrease in sales volumes compared to budgeted billed amounts. The following items reduced the increase in AICs cash from operating activities associated with continuing operations during 2009, compared with 2008: Income tax payments of $61 million in 2009, compared with income tax refunds of $72 million in 2008, primarily due to higher pretax book income. 54 Table of Contents A decrease in natural gas costs over recovered from customers under the PGA. A $21 million increase in interest payments primarily due to the senior secured notes issued in October 2008. A $21 million reduction in customer advances for construction. A $7 million increase in pension and other postretirement plan contributions. AICs cash from operating activities associated with discontinued operations decreased in 2009 compared with 2008. Factors contributing to the decrease in cash from operating activities at AERG during 2009, compared with 2008, included income tax payments of $68 million in 2009, compared with income tax refunds of $8 million in 2008, primarily due to higher pretax book income; increased coal purchases to build inventories at the Duck Creek generating facility as a result of switching coal blends in 2009; and the absence of $5 million, net of premiums, of replacement power insurance recoveries received in 2008 from an affiliate, as the policy was not renewed. Factors partially reducing the decrease in cash from operating activities at AERG during 2009, compared with 2008, included a $98 million increase in receipts from Marketing Company under the AERG PSA, primarily because of increased generation levels relative to Genco, as discussed in Results of Operations, and a $4 million reduction in funding required by the 2007 Illinois Settlement Agreement. Genco Gencos cash from operating activities decreased in 2009 compared with 2008. The following items contributed to the decrease in cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008: Electric margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, decreased by $265 million, excluding impacts of MTM transactions. A one time lump sum settlement payment was received in 2008 from a coal mine owner for early termination of a contract, which was included in electric margins in 2008 and did not recur in 2009. A $9 million increase in interest payments, primarily due to the senior unsecured notes issued in April 2008. The 2009 voluntary and involuntary separation programs resulted in severance payments of $4 million. The following items reduced the decrease in Gencos cash from operating activities during 2009, compared with 2008: A $78 million reduction in income tax payments primarily because of lower pretax book income at EEI. Reduced coal purchases in 2009 as generation levels declined. Pension Funding Amerens pension plans are funded in compliance with income tax regulations and to meet federal funding or regulatory requirements. As a result, Ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the greater of the pension expense or the legally required minimum contribution. Considering Amerens assumptions at December 31, 2010, its investment performance in 2010, and its pension funding policy, Ameren expects to make annual contributions of $75 million to $110 million in each of the next five years, with aggregate estimated contributions of $470 million. We expect UEs, AICs, and Gencos portion of the future funding requirements to be 63%, 28% and 9%, respectively. These amounts are estimates. They may change with actual investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in our assumptions, any pertinent changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions. In 2010, Ameren contributed $81 million to its pension plans. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report and Outlook for additional information. Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2010 versus 2009 Amerens cash used in investing activities decreased by $677 million during 2010, compared with 2009. There was a $673 million decrease in capital expenditures as compared with 2009 as a result of reductions in planned capital expenditures for the distribution system and power plant improvements during 2010, a $109 million reduction in capital expenditures to repair severe storm damage, and the completion of power plant scrubber projects in the Merchant Generation segment during 2009 and early 2010. Cash flows from investing activities in 2010 also benefited from the sale of 25% of Gencos Columbia CT facility and other properties. UEs cash used in investing activities decreased by $249 million during 2010, compared with 2009. There was a $264 million decrease in capital expenditures as compared with 2009 as a result of reductions in planned capital expenditures for the distribution system and power plant improvements during 2010, as well as a $74 million reduction in capital expenditures to repair severe storm damage. This cash benefit was reduced by a $10 million increase in nuclear fuel expenditures related to the timing of purchases and a $12 million net decrease in nuclear decommissioning trust fund activities. AICs cash used in investing activities decreased by $195 million during 2010, compared with 2009. There was a $70 million decrease in capital expenditures compared with 2009 as a result of reductions in planned capital expenditures for the distribution system during 2010 in response to revenues granted being significantly less than requested in a rate proceeding, as well as a $35 million reduction in capital expenditures to repair severe storm damage. Similar planned capital expenditure reductions at AERG resulted in the $85 million decrease in capital expenditures of discontinued operations. Additionally, AICs advances to ATXI for construction under a joint ownership agreement decreased during 2010 as the project approached completion. AIC received funding for this 55 Table of Contents construction under a generator interconnection agreement related to ongoing transmission upgrade projects. Gencos cash used in investing activities decreased by $360 million during 2010, compared with 2009. Reductions in planned capital expenditures, as well as completion of power plant scrubber projects during 2009, resulted in a $221 million decrease in capital expenditures compared with 2009. Cash flows from investing activities in 2010 also benefited from the $18 million of proceeds Genco received from the sale of 25% of its Columbia CT facility and net repayment of money pool advances. 2009 versus 2008 Ameren used less cash for investing activities in 2009 than in 2008. Net cash used for capital expenditures decreased in 2009 as a result of efforts to reduce, defer or cancel capital expenditure programs in light of economic conditions and the completion of power plant scrubber projects in the Merchant Generation segment. Additionally, a $93 million decrease in nuclear fuel expenditures due to timing of purchases and a $10 million decrease in emission allowance purchases, due to lower prices and lower generation levels, as well as reduced emission levels resulting from completion of plant scrubber projects in 2009, benefited cash during 2009. UEs cash used in investing activities decreased by $78 million during 2009, compared with 2008. Nuclear fuel expenditures decreased $93 million as a result of the timing of purchases. Cash used in investing activities in 2009 did not benefit from the receipt of $36 million in proceeds from intercompany note receivables with Ameren and one of its subsidiaries, as occurred during 2008. Capital expenditures were consistent year over year. Reductions in planned capital expenditures for distribution system and power plant improvements in 2009 were offset by increased expenditures to repair severe storm damage and $93 million of rebuilding expenditures at Taum Sauk. AICs cash used in investing activities during 2009 decreased by $125 million compared with 2008, as a result of a $165 million decrease in capital expenditures of discontinued operations (AERG). The decrease in capital expenditures was driven by ongoing efforts to reduce, defer, or cancel capital expenditure programs. This cash benefit was reduced by an $20 million increase in utility capital expenditures to repair severe storm damage and by an increase in advances to ATXI for construction under a joint ownership agreement. AIC received funding for this construction under a generator interconnection agreement related to ongoing transmission upgrade projects. Gencos cash used in investing activities increased by $23 million in 2009 compared with 2008 because of $73 million of net money pool advances in 2009. Capital expenditures decreased $37 million, principally because of reduced spending for power plant scrubber projects. One scrubber project was completed in November 2009, and a second scrubber project was completed in 2010. Emission allowance purchases decreased $10 million because of lower prices and lower generation levels, as well as reduced emission levels resulting from the completion of a plant scrubber project in 2009, which resulted in a benefit to cash in 2009. Capital Expenditures The following table presents the capital expenditures by the Ameren Companies for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008: Capital Expenditures 2010 2009 2008 Ameren(a) $ 1,031 $ 1,704 $ 1,896 UE 608 872 874 AIC 286 356 345 Genco 95 316 353 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries. Amerens 2010 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE spent $130 million toward two scrubbers at its Sioux power plant, which were completed in 2010. At Genco, there was a cash outlay of $29 million for power plant scrubber projects. The scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental regulations. Other capital expenditures were made principally to maintain, upgrade, and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE and AIC, as well as to fund various plant upgrades. Amerens 2009 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE spent $173 million toward two scrubbers at its Sioux power plant, and $93 million toward the Taum Sauk rebuild, and it incurred storm related expenditures of $78 million. AIC incurred storm related expenditures of $38 million. At Genco, there was a cash outlay of $169 million for power plant scrubber projects. The scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental regulations. Other capital expenditures were made principally to maintain, upgrade, and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE and AIC as well as various plant upgrades. Amerens 2008 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. UE spent $149 million toward a scrubber at one of its power plants, and incurred storm related expenditures of $12 million. AIC incurred storm related expenditures of $18 million. At Genco, there was a cash outlay of $205 million for power plant scrubber projects. The scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental regulations. Other capital expenditures were made principally to maintain, upgrade, and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of UE and AIC as well as various plant upgrades. The following table estimates the capital expenditures that will be incurred by the Ameren Companies from 2011 through 2015, including construction expenditures, capitalized interest for the Merchant Generation business, 56 Table of Contents allowance for funds used during construction for our rate regulated utility business, and estimated expenditures for compliance with known and existing environmental regulations: 2011 2012 2015 Total UE $ 685 $ 2,500 $ 3,400 $ 3,185 $ 4,085 AIC 310 1,550 2,050 1,860 2,360 Genco 180 600 850 780 1,030 Other 75 450 600 525 675 Ameren(a) $ 1,250 $ 5,100 $ 6,900 $ 6,350 $ 8,150 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries. UEs estimated capital expenditures include transmission, distribution, and generation related investments, as well as expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations discussed below. AICs estimated capital expenditures are primarily for electric and natural gas transmission and distribution related investments. Gencos estimated capital expenditures are primarily for compliance with environmental regulations and upgrades to existing coal and gas fired generating facilities discussed below. We continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs. As a result, we could modify our plan for generation capacity, which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and whether capacity or power may be purchased, among other things. Any changes that we make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material. Environmental Capital Expenditures Ameren, UE and Genco will incur significant costs in future years to comply with existing and known federal EPA and state regulations regarding SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants. In addition to existing laws and regulations governing our facilities, the EPA is developing numerous new environmental regulations that will have a significant impact on the electric utility industry. These regulations could be particularly burdensome for certain companies, including Ameren, UE and Genco, that operate coal fired power plants. Significant new rules already proposed or promulgated within the past year include the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions; revised ambient air quality standards for SO2 and NOx emissions that increase the stringency of the existing ozone ambient air quality standard; the CATR, which would require further reduction of SO2 and NOx emissions from power plants; and a regulation governing coal ash impoundments. Within the next year, the EPA is also expected to propose new regulations under the Clean Water Act that could require significant capital expenditures such as new water intake structures or cooling towers at our power plants; NSPS and emission guidelines for greenhouse gas emissions applicable to new and existing electric generating units; and a MACT standard for the control of hazardous air pollutants such as mercury and acid gases from power plants. Such new regulations may be challenged with lawsuits, so the timing of their ultimate implementation is uncertain. Although many details of these future regulations are unknown, the combined effect of the new and proposed environmental regulations may result in significant capital expenditures and or increased operating costs over the next five to eight years for Ameren, UE and Genco. Actions required to ensure that our facilities and operations are in compliance with environmental laws and regulations could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, these regulations could require us to close or to significantly alter the operation of our generating facilities, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The estimates in the table below contain all of the known capital costs to comply with existing environmental regulations and our preliminary assessment of the potential impacts of the EPAs proposed regulations for coal combustion byproducts, the CATR, and the revised ambient air quality standards for SO2 and NOx emissions as of December 31, 2010. The estimates in the table below assume that coal combustion byproducts will ultimately be regarded as nonhazardous. The estimates shown in the table below could change depending upon additional federal or state requirements, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, new hourly ambient air quality standards or changes to existing standards for SO2 and NOx emissions, the requirements under a MACT standard for the control of hazardous air pollutants such as mercury and acid gases, the requirements under the finalized CATR, any new regulations under the Clean Water Act, a hazardous classification of coal combustion by products, new technology, and variations in costs of material or labor, or alternative compliance strategies, among other factors. 2011 2012 2015 2016 2020 Total UE(a) $ 35 $ 850 $ 1,050 $ 1,380 $ 1,610 $ 2,265 $ 2,695 Genco 125 470 580 50 60 645 765 AERG 10 125 160 5 10 140 180 Ameren $ 170 $ 1,445 $ 1,790 $ 1,435 $ 1,680 $ 3,050 $ 3,640 (a) UEs expenditures are expected to be recoverable from ratepayers. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a further discussion of environmental matters, including global climate change. Cash Flows from Financing Activities 2010 versus 2009 During 2010, we replaced and extended the expiration of our credit facilities, and we sought to reduce our reliance on borrowings from these credit facilities, and reduce long term debt outstanding while maintaining adequate cash balances for working capital needs. 57 Table of Contents Ameren had an $807 million net use of cash from financing activities in 2010, compared with a $342 million net source of cash in 2009. During 2010, Amerens cash flow from operating activities of $1.8 billion exceeded its capital expenditures of $1.0 billion and common stock dividend requirements of $368 million. Ameren utilized this cash to redeem $310 million of long term debt and $52 million of preferred stock in 2010. During 2009, Ameren issued $1 billion of senior debt and $634 million in common stock and used the proceeds to repurchase, redeem, and fund maturities of $631 million of long term debt, to reduce short term borrowings, and to fund capital expenditures and other working capital needs at UE, AIC, and Genco. UE had a $337 million net use of cash from financing activities in 2010, compared with a $250 million net source of cash in 2009. Planned reductions of expenditures, allowed UE to use cash from operations and credit facility borrowings to fund its capital expenditures and working capital needs without issuing additional senior debt or capital contributions from Ameren. Additionally, during 2010, these efforts allowed UE to redeem $70 million of long term debt, including its 7.69% Series A subordinated debentures; to redeem all outstanding shares of its $7.64 Series preferred stock; to increase common stock dividends by $60 million; and to reduce short term and intercompany borrowing repayments by $343 million, compared with 2009. AICs net cash used in financing activities increased by $173 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Reduction of planned expenditures allowed it to use cash from operations to fund its capital expenditures and working capital needs without the issuance of additional senior debt or capital contributions from Ameren. Additionally, AICs common stock dividends increased $35 million compared with 2009, and CILCO redeemed all of its preferred stock in connection with the AIC Merger. During 2009, Ameren made capital contributions to AIC of $272 million and AIC repaid $250 million of long term debt and $62 million of short term borrowing balances. Genco had a $251 million net use of cash from financing activities in 2010, compared with a $139 million net source of cash in 2009, primarily as a result of reductions of planned expenditures. These efforts allowed Genco to use cash from operations and credit facility borrowings to fund capital expenditures, to meet working capital needs, to repay its $200 million of 8.35% senior notes at maturity, and to repay a net $176 million of intercompany note borrowings in 2010. Additionally, Genco received a capital contribution from Ameren associated with a tax allocation agreement that benefited 2010 cash flows from financing activities. During 2009, Genco issued $249 million of long term debt and used the proceeds to repay short term borrowings and to fund general corporate purposes. 2009 versus 2008 During 2009, Ameren and its subsidiaries issued $1 billion of senior debt and $634 million in common stock. It used the proceeds to repurchase, redeem, and fund maturities of $631 million of long term debt, to reduce short term borrowings, and to fund capital expenditures and other working capital needs at UE, AIC and Genco. During 2008, Amerens subsidiaries issued $1.9 billion of senior debt and $154 million in common stock and used the proceeds to repurchase, redeem, and fund maturities of $842 million of long term debt, to reduce short term borrowings, and to fund capital expenditures and other working capital needs at UE, AIC and Genco. Amerens capital issuance costs increased in 2009 compared with 2008 because of $40 million in banking fees associated with the 2009 Multiyear Credit Agreements and the 2009 Illinois Credit Agreement, and $17 million of issuance costs associated with Amerens September 2009 common stock issuance, partially offset by a decrease in issuance costs associated with long term debt. Benefiting 2009 cash from financing activities, compared with 2008, was a $196 million decrease in common stock dividends and a $47 million increase in generator advances received for construction under generator interconnection agreements, net of repayments. UEs net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $55 million during 2009, compared with 2008, primarily because of $251 million of short term borrowings repayments in 2009 compared with net short term borrowings of $169 million in 2008, a $350 million decrease in the issuances of long term debt, and a $184 million increase in net repayments under an intercompany borrowing arrangement with Ameren. Benefits to cash for 2009, compared with 2008, included a $436 million capital contribution from Ameren funded by the proceeds of Amerens September 2009 common stock issuance, a $378 million decrease in redemptions of long term debt, and an $89 million decrease in common stock dividend payments. The proceeds from the capital contribution were primarily used to reduce outstanding short term borrowings. AIC had a $151 million net use of cash from financing activities in 2009, compared with a $103 million net source of cash in 2008, primarily as a result of efforts to improve its liquidity position in response to the turmoil experienced in the capital and credit markets during 2009 and 2008. These efforts included no long term debt issuances in 2009, which meant an $880 million decrease in long term debt issuances from 2008. AIC also received a $272 million capital contribution from Ameren that was made to maintain a capital structure of approximately 50% to 55% equity. Additionally, improved financial results allowed AIC to increase dividend payments from 2008 by $38 million. The change in short term borrowing arrangements at AERG also affected the 2009 financing activity of discontinued operations as compared with 2008. Genco had a $139 million net source of cash from financing activities in 2009, compared with a $54 million net use of cash in 2008, primarily as a result of efforts to improve its liquidity position in response to the turmoil experienced in the capital and credit markets during 2009 58 Table of Contents and 2008, as well as its efforts to reduce, defer and cancel expenditures. As a result of these efforts, Genco decreased common stock dividends by $178 million and short term borrowing repayments by $100 million. These benefits to cash during the 2009 period were slightly offset by a $106 million decrease in net money pool borrowings and a $51 million decrease in the issuance of long term debt. Credit Facility Borrowings and Liquidity The liquidity needs of the Ameren Companies are typically supported through the use of available cash, short term intercompany borrowings, drawings under committed bank credit facilities, or commercial paper issuances. See Note 4 Credit Facility Borrowings and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on credit facilities, short term borrowing activity, relevant interest rates, and borrowings under Amerens utility and non state regulated subsidiary money pool arrangements. The following table presents the committed bank credit facilities of Ameren and the Ameren Companies, and their availability, as of December 31, 2010: Credit Facility Expiration Amount Committed Amount Available Ameren and UE: 2010 Missouri Credit Agreement(a)(b) September 2011 $ 800 $ 445 (c) Ameren and Genco: 2010 Genco Credit Agreement(a) September 2013 500 400 Ameren and AIC: 2010 Illinois Credit Agreement(a) September 2013 800 800 Ameren: $20 million revolving credit facility June 2012 20 (a) The Ameren Companies may access these credit facilities through intercompany borrowing arrangements. (b) This credit agreement expires on September 10, 2013. The borrowing sublimit of UE will mature and expire on September 9, 2011, subject to extension on a 364 day basis, as requested by the borrower and approved by the lenders, or for a longer period upon receipt of any and all required federal or state regulatory approvals, as permitted under the credit agreement, but in no event later than September 10, 2013. UE is seeking state regulatory approval to extend the maturity date of its borrowing sublimit under the 2010 Missouri Credit Agreement to September 10, 2013. (c) In addition to amounts drawn on these facilities, the amount available is further reduced by standby letters of credit issued under the facilities. The amount of such letters of credit at December 31, 2010, was $15 million. The 2010 Credit Agreements are used to support Ameren and UEs commercial paper programs. Ameren may at its discretion use any of the 2010 Credit Agreements to support its commercial paper programs, subject to its borrowing sublimits. At December 31, 2010, Ameren had $269 million of commercial paper outstanding, which reduced the available amounts under these facilities. Based on outstanding borrowings under the 2010 Credit Agreements (and considering reductions for $15 million of letters of credit issued and $269 million of commercial paper borrowings), the aggregate available amount under the 2010 Credit Agreements at December 31, 2010, was $1.38 billion. The combined maximum amount available to all of the borrowers, collectively, under the 2010 Credit Agreements is $2.1 billion. The maximum aggregate amount available to each borrower under each facility is shown in the following table (such amount being such borrowers Borrowing Sublimit): 2010MissouriCreditAgreement 2010GencoCreditAgreement 2010 IllinoisCreditAgreement Ameren $ 500 $ 500 $ 300 UE 500 (a ) (a ) AIC (a ) (a ) 800 Genco (a ) 500 (a ) (a) Not applicable. These credit facilities were also available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short term borrowing authorizations, by EEI or by other Ameren non state regulated subsidiaries through direct short term borrowings from Ameren and by most of Amerens non rate regulated subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Ameren Services, Resources Company, AERG and Marketing Company, through a non state regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to coordinate and to provide for certain short term cash and working capital requirements. Separate money pools are maintained for utility and non state regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among Ameren, AIC, and Ameren Services enables AIC to make short term borrowings directly from Ameren. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time by AIC under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money pool agreement, together with any outstanding external credit facility borrowings by AIC, may not exceed $500 million, pursuant to authorization from the ICC. AIC is not currently borrowing under the unilateral borrowing agreement. Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the money pool agreements. See Note 4 Credit Facility Borrowings and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement. 59 Table of Contents On June 2, 2010, Ameren entered into a $20 million revolving credit facility ($20 Million Facility) that matures on June 1, 2012. The $20 Million Facility has been fully drawn since June 15, 2010. Borrowings under the $20 Million Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum. The obligations of Ameren under the $20 Million Facility are unsecured. No subsidiary of Ameren is a party to, guarantor of, or borrower under the facility. See Note 4 Credit Facility Borrowings and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. The issuance of short term debt securities by Amerens utility subsidiaries is subject to approval by FERC under the Federal Power Act. In March 2010, FERC issued an order authorizing the issuance of up to $1 billion of short term debt securities for UE. The authorization was effective as of April 1, 2010, and terminates on March 31, 2012. On October 1, 2010, FERC authorized AIC to issue up to $1 billion of short term debt securities. The authorization became effective immediately and terminates on September 30, 2012. On July 16, 2010, FERC granted Gencos request for unlimited long and short term debt issuance authorization. EEI has unlimited short term debt authorization from FERC. The issuance of short term debt securities by Ameren is not subject to approval by any regulatory body. The Ameren Companies continually evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of their liquidity arrangements given changing business conditions. When business conditions warrant, changes may be made to existing credit facilities or to other short term borrowing arrangements. Long term Debt and Equity The following table presents the issuances of common stock and the issuances, redemptions, repurchases and maturities of long term debt and preferred stock (net of any issuance discounts and including any redemption premiums) for the years 2010, 2009, and 2008 for the Ameren Companies. For additional information related to the terms and uses of these issuances and the sources of funds and terms for the redemptions, see Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

IP cancelled these preferred shares. In November 2008, Ameren, as a well known seasoned issuer, along with AICs predecessor companies, CIPS, CILCO and IP, and Genco, filed a Form S 3 shelf registration statement registering the issuance of an indeterminate amount of certain types of securities, which expires in November 2011. As amended in December 2010, Ameren, AIC and Genco may offer securities pursuant to the November 2008 Form S 3 shelf registration statement. In June 2008, UE, as a well known seasoned issuer, filed a Form S 3 shelf registration statement registering the issuance of an indeterminate amount of certain types of securities, which expires in June 2011. A Form S 3 registration statement was filed by Ameren with the SEC in July 2008, and supplemented in December 2010, authorizing the offering of six million additional shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at Amerens option, newly issued shares, treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Ameren is currently selling newly issued shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Ameren is also selling newly issued shares of common stock under its 401(k) plan pursuant to an effective SEC Form S 8 registration statement. Under DRPlus and its 401(k) plan, Ameren issued 3.0 million, 3.2 million, and 4.0 million shares of common stock in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, which were valued at $80 million, $82 million, and $154 million for the respective years. 61 Table of Contents In September 2009, Ameren issued and sold 21.85 million shares of its common stock at $25.25 per share, for proceeds of $535 million, net of $17 million of issuance costs. Ameren used the offering proceeds to make investments in its rate regulated utility subsidiaries in the form of capital contributions to UE and AIC of $436 million and $99 million, respectively. The Ameren Companies may sell securities registered under their effective registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant such sales. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus that meets the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants See Note 4 Credit Facility Borrowings and Liquidity and Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions (and applicable cross default provisions) contained in our bank credit and term loan agreements and in certain of the Ameren Companies indenture agreements and articles of incorporation. At December 31, 2010, the Ameren Companies were in compliance with their credit agreements, indentures, and articles of incorporation provisions and covenants. We consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows. Inability to raise capital on reasonable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses. After assessing our current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets or make access to the capital markets uncertain or limited. Such events could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. Dividends Ameren paid to its shareholders common stock dividends totaling $368 million, or $1.54 per share, in 2010, $338 million, or $1.54 per share, in 2009, and $534 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2008. The payout of common stock dividends exceeded net income in 2010 because of noncash goodwill and other impairment charges recorded during 2010. The payout rate based on net income in 2009 and 2008 was 55% and 88%, respectively. Dividends paid to common shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the same periods were 20% in 2010, 17% in 2009 and 35% in 2008. The amount and timing of dividends payable on Amerens common stock are within the sole discretion of Amerens board of directors. The board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends. However, as it has done in the past, the board of directors is expected to consider various issues, including Amerens overall payout ratio, payout ratios of our peers, projected cash flow and potential future cash flow requirements, historical earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, impacts of regulatory orders or legislation, and other key business considerations. On February 9, 2011, the board of directors of Ameren declared a quarterly dividend on Amerens common stock of 38.5 cents per share, payable on March 31, 2011, to shareholders of record on March 9, 2011. Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the Ameren Companies payment of dividends in certain circumstances. At December 31, 2010, none of these circumstances existed at the Ameren Companies and, as a result, they were allowed to pay dividends. Under UEs mortgage indenture, $31 million of total retained earnings as of December 31, 2010, was restricted against payment of common dividends, except those dividends payable in common stock, which left $2 billion of free and unrestricted retained earnings at December 31, 2010. AICs articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Gencos indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making any dividend payments on common stock if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold. UE, AIC and Genco as well as certain other nonregistrant Ameren subsidiaries are subject to Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for any officer or director of a public utility, as defined in the Federal Power Act, to participate in the making or paying of any dividend from any funds properly included in capital account. The meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the Federal Power Act or FERC regulations. However, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, (2) the dividends are not excessive, and (3) there is no self dealing on the part of corporate officials. At a minimum, Ameren believes that dividends can be paid by its subsidiaries that are public utilities from net income and retained earnings. In addition, under Illinois law, AIC may not pay any dividend on its stock, unless, among other things, its earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves, or unless AIC has specific authorization from the ICC. In its application for the FERC orders approving the AIC Merger and the AERG distribution, Ameren committed to maintain a minimum of 30% equity in its capital structure at AIC following the AIC Merger and the AERG distribution. 62 Table of Contents The following table presents common stock dividends paid by Ameren Corporation and by Amerens subsidiaries to their respective parents: 2010 2009 2008 UE $ 235 $ 175 $ 264 AIC 133 98 60 Genco 43 221 Nonregistrants including eliminations 22 (11 ) Dividends paid by Ameren $ 368 $ 338 $ 534 Certain of the Ameren Companies have issued preferred stock, which provides for cumulative preferred stock dividends. Each companys board of directors considers the declaration of the preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which the dividend is payable and the amount to be paid. See Note 5 Long Term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred stock issuances. Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding expected minimum funding levels for our pension plans. These expected pension funding amounts are not included in the table below. In addition, routine short term purchase order commitments are not included.

(e) Amounts related to certain real estate leases and railroad licenses have indefinite payment periods. Amerens $2 million annual obligation for these items is included in the Less than 1 Year, 1 3 Years, and 3 5 Years columns. Amounts for After 5 Years are not included in the total amount because that period is indefinite. (f) See Other Obligations within Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8 of this report, for discussion of items included herein. 63 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2010, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits under the authoritative accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions were $246 million, $164 million, $56 million, and $20 million for Ameren, UE, AIC, and Genco, respectively. It is reasonably possible to expect that the settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit will result in an underpayment or overpayment of tax and related interest. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the timing of cash payments or receipts associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The amount and timing of certain payments or receipts is not reliably estimable or determinable at this time. See Note 13 Income Taxes under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding the Ameren Companies unrecognized tax benefits and related liabilities for interest expense. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2010, none of the Ameren Companies had off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future. Credit Ratings The credit ratings of the Ameren Companies affect our liquidity, our access to the capital markets and credit markets, our cost of borrowing under our credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts. The following table presents the principal credit ratings of the Ameren Companies by Moodys, S&P, and Fitch effective on the date of this report: Moodys S&P Fitch Ameren: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa3 BBB BBB Senior unsecured debt Baa3 BB+ BBB Commercial paper P 3 A 3 F2 UE: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa2 BBB BBB+ Secured debt A3 BBB+ A AIC: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa3 BBB BBB Secured debt Baa1 BBB BBB+ Senior unsecured debt Baa3 BBB BBB Genco: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa3 BBB BBB Senior unsecured debt Baa3 BBB BBB Collateral Postings Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. Such changes may also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel, power, and gas supply, among other things, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. Cash collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties including postings related to exchange traded contracts at December 31, 2010, were $166 million, $15 million and $116 million at Ameren, UE and AIC, respectively. The amount of cash collateral external counterparties posted with Ameren was less than $1 million at December 31, 2010. Sub investment grade issuer or senior unsecured debt ratings (lower than BBB or Baa3) at December 31, 2010, could have resulted in Ameren, UE, AIC or Genco being required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to $274 million, $93 million, $111 million, and $28 million, respectively. Changes in commodity prices could trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments at current credit ratings. If market prices were 15% higher than December 31, 2010, levels in the next 12 months and 20% higher thereafter through the end of the term of the commodity contracts, then Ameren, UE, AIC or Genco could be required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations up to approximately $61 million, $13 million, $ million, and $ million, respectively. If market prices were 15% lower than December 31, 2010, levels in the next 12 months and 20% lower thereafter through the end of the term of the commodity contracts, then Ameren, UE, AIC or Genco could be required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations up to approximately $107 million, $9 million, $62 million, and $ million, respectively. The cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can also increase or decrease depending upon the credit ratings of the borrower. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. It should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. OUTLOOK Below are some key trends that may affect the Ameren Companies financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in 2011 and beyond. Economy and Capital and Credit Markets Economic conditions in our service territory continued to improve in 2010, which contributed to higher sales volume, exclusive of abnormal weather impacts, to Amerens rate regulated utilities native load customers. However, weak economic conditions, declining natural gas prices, and other factors resulted in reduced power prices and a decline in observable industry market multiples for companies similar to Ameren. Weak economic conditions expose the Ameren Companies to greater risk of default by counterparties, potentially higher bad debt expenses, and the risk of impairment of goodwill and long lived assets, among other things. In the third quarter of 2010, both Ameren and Genco recorded goodwill and long lived asset impairment 64 Table of Contents charges at their Merchant Generation reporting unit. A failure of reporting units to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results and cash flows, new environmental rules and regulations, or a decline of observable industry market multiples in the future could result in the recognition of additional goodwill or long lived asset impairment charges. For 2010, the actual return on investment of Amerens pension plan and postretirement plan assets exceeded the expected return. These returns and future returns will impact our future pension and postretirement expenses and pension funding levels. During 2010, we observed an improvement in the U.S. capital and credit markets and lower interest rates on new issuances of investment grade debt securities compared with 2008 and 2009, when these markets experienced extreme volatility. The Ameren Companies continue to have access to the capital markets at commercially acceptable rates. A future disruption in the capital or credit markets could limit our ability to access the capital and credit markets, which our business depends upon, and result in increased financing costs. On September 10, 2010, Ameren and certain of its subsidiaries entered into new multiyear credit facility agreements. These facilities cumulatively provide $2.1 billion of credit through September 10, 2013, subject to borrowing sublimit extensions. The costs of these credit facilities are less than the costs of the facilities they replaced. Costs are being amortized over the term of the 2010 Credit Agreements. Fees for UE will be deferred for recovery in future customer rates. In addition, borrowing rates under the facilities decreased, including, in the case of Ameren, from LIBOR plus 3.25%, under the prior credit facilities, to LIBOR plus 2.05%. At December 31, 2010, Ameren, on a consolidated basis, had available liquidity, in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under its existing credit facilities, of approximately $1.9 billion, which was equivalent to the amount of available liquidity at December 31, 2009. Economic conditions could affect the Ameren Companies results of operations, financial position and liquidity. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report for additional information. We believe that our liquidity is adequate given our expected operating cash flows, capital expenditures, and related financing plans. However, there can be no assurance that significant changes in economic conditions, disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or other unforeseen events will not materially affect our ability to execute our expected operating, capital or financing plans. Current Capital Expenditure Plans Between 2011 and 2020, Ameren expects to invest up to $3.6 billion, in the aggregate, to retrofit its coal fired power plants with pollution control equipment in compliance with existing and known environmental laws and regulations. Any pollution control investments will result in decreased plant availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses. Approximately 74% of this investment is expected to be in UEs operations, and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers, subject to prudency reviews. Regulatory lag may materially affect the timing of such recovery and, therefore affect our cash flows and related financing needs. The recoverability of amounts expended in our Merchant Generation operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions reflecting increased environmental costs for coal fired generators. Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on emissions would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force Ameren and other similarly situated electric power generators to close some coal fired facilities. Investments to control emissions at Amerens coal fired power plants to comply with future legislation or regulations would significantly increase future capital expenditures and operations and maintenance expenses, which if excessive could result in the closure of coal fired power plants, impairment of assets, or otherwise materially adversely affect Amerens results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. UE continues to evaluate its longer term needs for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity. UEs integrated resource plan filed with the MoPSC in February 2011 included the expectation that new baseload generation capacity would be required between 2020 and 2030. Because of the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload power plant, UE continues to study future generation alternatives, including energy efficiency programs that could help defer new plant construction. To prepare for the long term need for baseload capacity, and to prepare for potentially more stringent environmental regulation of coal fired power plants, which could lead to the retirement of current baseload assets, UE is taking steps to preserve options to meet future demand. These steps include seeking improvements in regulatory treatment of energy efficiency investments, evaluating potential sites for natural gas fired generation, and pursuing an ESP for an additional unit at its Callaway nuclear plant site subject to passage of state legislation that would ensure rate recovery of permit costs. UE is considering filing an application to obtain an ESP from the NRC at the Callaway nuclear plant site. In December 2010 and January 2011, the Missouri Energy Partnership Act was separately introduced in both the Missouri Senate and House of Representatives. The purpose of this legislation is to maintain an option for nuclear power in the state of Missouri, recover the costs of the ESP for a period up to 20 years, and provide appropriate consumer protections. Should the Missouri legislation be enacted into law, UE plans to file 65 Table of Contents an ESP application with the NRC in 2011. NRC approval of an ESP application often takes three to four years. As of December 31, 2010, UE had capitalized approximately $67 million relating to its efforts to construct a new nuclear unit. All of these incurred costs will remain capitalized while management assesses all options to maximize the value of its investment in this project. If all efforts are permanently abandoned or if management concludes it is probable the cost incurred will be disallowed in rates, it is possible that a charge to earnings could be recognized in a future period. UE intends to submit a license extension application with the NRC to extend its existing Callaway nuclear plants operating license by 20 years so that the license will expire in 2044. UE cannot predict whether or when the NRC will approve the license extension. Over the next few years, we expect to make significant investments in our electric and natural gas infrastructure and to incur increased operations and maintenance expenses to improve overall system reliability. We are committed to aligning our operations and maintenance spending and capital investments within our rate regulated businesses with the revenue and related cash flow levels provided by our regulators. We expect these costs or investments at our rate regulated businesses to be ultimately recovered in rates, subject to prudency reviews by regulators, although rate case outcomes and regulatory lag could materially impact the timing of such recovery and, therefore, our cash flows, related financing needs and the timing in which we are able to proceed with these projects. We are projecting labor and material costs for these capital expenditures will increase over time. ATX intends to build projects initially within Illinois and Missouri, with the potential for expanding to other areas in the future. ATXs initial investments are expected to be the Grand Rivers projects, the first of which involves building a 345 kilovolt line across the state of Illinois, from the Missouri border to the Indiana border. The investment could total more than $1.3 billion through 2021, with a potential investment of $265 million from 2011 to 2015. In September 2010, Resources Company announced that it signed a cooperative agreement with the DOE that could lead to repowering Gencos Meredosia plant. This would create the worlds first full scale, oxy combustion coal fired power plant designed for permanent CO2 capture and storage. Ameren and two independent companies will assess the project in phases to validate its scope, cost, schedule and commercial viability. If the first phases are successful and the project has received regulatory approval, Ameren and its partners will initiate the construction necessary to repower the plant. Increased investments for environmental compliance, reliability improvement, and new baseload capacity will result in higher depreciation and financing costs. Revenues The earnings of UE and AIC are largely determined by the regulation of their rates by state agencies. Rising costs, including labor, material, depreciation, and financing costs, coupled with increased capital and operations and maintenance expenditures targeted at enhanced distribution system reliability and environmental compliance, are expected. Ameren, UE and AIC anticipate regulatory lag until their requests to increase rates to recover such costs on a timely basis are granted by state regulators. Ameren, UE and AIC expect to file rate cases frequently. In future rate cases, UE and AIC will continue to seek cost recovery and tracking mechanisms from their state regulators to reduce the effects of regulatory lag. In April 2010, the ICC issued a rate order for AIC, which was amended in May 2010, that approved a net increase in annual revenues for electric delivery service of $35 million and a net decrease in annual revenues for natural gas delivery service of $20 million. The rate changes became effective in May 2010. AIC as well as some intervenors requested a rehearing with the ICC. In November 2010, the ICC approved an order on the rehearing issues, which authorized an increase in annual revenues of $25 million, in addition to the net $15 million authorized in the ICCs May 2010 amended rate order. The overall annual delivery service revenue increase as a result of these orders is $40 million. The rate changes relating to the rehearing issues became effective on November 19, 2010. The April 2010 ICC order confirmed the previously approved 80% allocation of fixed nonvolumetric residential and commercial natural gas customer charges and approved a higher percentage of recovery of fixed nonvolumetric electric residential and commercial customer charges. The percentage of costs to be recovered through fixed nonvolumetric electric residential and commercial customer and meter charges increased from 27% to 40%. AIC filed a request with the ICC in February 2011 to increase its annual revenues for electric delivery service by $60 million. AIC also filed a request with the ICC in February 2011 to increase its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by $51 million. AIC is using a future test year, 2012, in each of these rate requests, which is designed to reduce regulatory lag. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. A decision by the ICC in these proceedings is required by January 2012. AIC filed a request with FERC in January 2011 to increase its annual revenues for electric delivery service for its wholesale customers by approximately $11 million. AIC provides electric delivery service to nine wholesale customers. These wholesale delivery revenues are treated as a deduction in AICs revenue requirement in retail rate filings with the ICC. AIC reached an agreement with one customer prior to the filings, and that customers new rates are expected to 66 Table of Contents become effective on April 1, 2011. With respect to the remaining eight customers, AIC requested that the new rates become effective on February 1, 2011. In February 2011, these eight customers filed protests with FERC objecting to the proposed rates. The final rates and corresponding revenue amounts will become known after the FERC proceeding concludes, either through settlements reached between customers and AIC, or after the filings are fully litigated. The FERC is expected to rule on the January filings in 2011, and to allow the new rates to take effect subject to refund. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these filings or their impact on Amerens or AICs results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. In May 2010, the MoPSC issued an order approving an increase for UE in annual revenues for electric service of approximately $230 million, including $119 million to cover higher fuel costs and lower revenue from sales outside UEs system. The rate changes became effective on June 21, 2010. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information about other significant provisions of the MoPSCs order. The provisions of the May 2010 MoPSC order also resulted in the recognition of new regulatory assets. These new regulatory assets are being amortized over the next two to five years beginning July 2010, as described in Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report. The increased amortization of the regulatory assets and the increase in annual depreciation expense due to the adoption of the life span depreciation methodology is estimated to increase UEs pretax expense by $25 million in 2011. Noranda appealed certain aspects of the MoPSCs January 2009 electric rate order to the Circuit Court of Stoddard County and was granted a stay by the Circuit Court of Stoddard County as it applies specifically to Norandas electric service account until the court renders its decision on the appeal. In September 2010, UE filed an appeal with the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Southern District of Missouri. The Court of Appeals will conduct an independent review of the MoPSCs January 2009 electric order. A decision by the Court of Appeals is not expected until at least the third quarter of 2011. On February 16, 2011, the Missouri Office of Public Counsel (MoOPC) made a filing with the MoPSC in which the MoOPC argued that the December 20, 2010 Order Granting Stay Pursuant to Section 386.520 (Stay Order), discussed below, of the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri (Circuit Court) should apply to all UE customers rather than to just the four UE industrial customers that requested the Circuit Court to grant these industrial customers request to stay the MoPSCs 2010 Missouri electric rate order as to their billings. On that basis, the MoOPC requested the MoPSC to suspend UEs currently effective rate schedules (approved by the 2010 Missouri electric rate order) and to replace them with UEs previously effective rate schedules (approved by the 2009 Missouri electric rate order) for all customers. If the requested suspension occurs, it would continue until the earlier of the time that a subsequent order is issued by the MoPSC, or an order reversing any such suspension is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, but in no event beyond the implementation of new electric rates for UE. It is anticipated that new electric rates for UE will take effect by early August 2011, pursuant to an anticipated MoPSC rate order in UEs currently pending electric rate proceeding. If the currently effective 2010 rate schedules are suspended for all customers such that UE is only able to charge customers under its previously effective rate schedules for service provided for the period March through August 2011, the reduced charges, which would reflect the difference between billings under the 2010 Missouri electric rate order and billings under the 2009 Missouri electric rate order, are estimated at approximately $100 million and would result in corresponding reductions in pretax earnings and cash flows. Also on February 16, 2011, the Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers (MIEC), of which the four UE industrial customers referred to above are members, made a filing with the MoPSC in response to the MoOPC filing discussed above. In its filing, MIEC supported the position set forth in the MoOPC filing that the Stay Order should apply to all UE customers, except that MIEC requested the MoPSC to suspend UEs currently effective rate schedules, including its FAC, and replace them with UEs rate schedules approved by the MoPSC in its 2007 electric rate order. If the requested suspension occurs, it would continue until the earlier of the time that a subsequent order is issued by the MoPSC, or an order reversing any such suspension is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, but in no event beyond the implementation of new electric rates for UE. As noted, it is anticipated that new electric rates for UE will take effect by early August 2011. If the currently effective 2010 rate schedules (including the FAC) are suspended for all customers such that UE is only able to charge customers under its previously effective rate schedules for service provided for the period March through August 2011, the reduced charges, which would reflect the difference between billings under the 2010 Missouri electric rate order and billings under the 2007 Missouri electric rate order, including FAC billings, are estimated at approximately $300 million and would result in corresponding reductions in pretax earnings and cash flows. The filings by the MoOPC and MIEC relate to the December 20, 2010 Stay Order, in which the Circuit Court granted the request of four UE industrial customers to stay the MoPSCs 2010 Missouri electric rate order and to require those customers to pay into the Circuit Courts registry the difference between their billings under the 2010 Missouri electric rate order and their billings under a Missouri electric rate order that became effective in June 2007, the last UE rate order for which appeals have been exhausted. On February 15, 2011, the four UE industrial customers posted the bond required by the Stay Order and are 67 Table of Contents expected to begin making the required payments into the Circuit Courts registry. The Stay Order does not address the merits of the appeals of the MoPSCs 2010 electric rate order or the 2009 electric rate order, which will be addressed in the ordinary course of the judicial review process. The judicial review process typically takes 18 to 24 months to complete following the initiation of the process. At this time, UE does not believe any aspect of the 2009 and 2010 electric rate increases authorized by the 2009 and 2010 Missouri electric rate orders are probable of refund to UEs customers. If UE were to conclude that some portion of these rate increases become probable of refund to UEs customers, a charge to earnings would be recorded for the estimated amount of refund in the period in which that decision was made. UE disagrees with the Stay Order, as well as the related filings made by the MoOPC and MIEC with the MoPSC. With respect to further proceedings regarding the Stay Order, the pending review proceedings regarding the 2009 and 2010 Missouri electric rate orders and the MoOPCs and MIECs filings with the MoPSC, UE will continue to address the merits of those orders and filings through the judicial and regulatory review processes. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Taum Sauk was not available to generate electricity for off system revenues during 2009; however, UE included an adjustment in the calculation of the FAC for Taum Sauk off system revenues. Therefore, UEs customers received the benefit of Taum Sauks historical off system revenues even though the plant was not operational. Upon Taum Sauks return to service, which occurred in April 2010, the adjustment figure was eliminated and UEs earnings and cash flows from operations increased. Taum Sauk is expected to increase UEs margins during the first quarter of 2011 by $7 million. UE filed a request with the MoPSC in September 2010 to increase its annual revenues for electric service by approximately $263 million. Of that request, approximately $110 million relates to recovery of the costs of installing and operating two scrubbers at UEs Sioux plant. Also included in this requested increase is a $73 million anticipated increase in normalized net fuel costs above the net fuel costs included in base rates previously authorized by the MoPSC in its May 2010 electric rate order. Absent initiation of this general rate proceeding, 95% of this amount would have been reflected in rate adjustments implemented under UEs FAC. Capital additions relating to enhancements at the rebuilt Taum Sauk facility were also included in the increase request. In February 2011, the MoPSC staff responded to the UE request for an electric service rate increase. The MoPSC staff recommended an increase to UEs annual revenues of between $45 million and $99 million based on a return on equity of 8.25% to 9.25%. Included in this recommendation was approximately $50 million of increases in normalized net fuel costs and $32 million of asset disallowances relating to the Sioux plant scrubbers. Other parties also made recommendations through testimony filed in this case. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. A decision by the MoPSC in this proceeding is required by the end of July 2011. In January 2011, the MoPSC approved a stipulation and agreement that resolved a June 2010 request by UE to increase annual natural gas revenues. The stipulation and agreement authorized an increase in annual natural gas delivery revenues of $9 million, which included approximately $2 million of annual revenues previously collected through the ISRS rider for the test year ended December 31, 2009. The new rates became effective on February 20, 2011. The stipulation and agreement approved a revised block rate structure for residential customers that results in more certainty of margin revenue recovery regardless of weather conditions or conservation efforts as recovery is less dependent on usage. Missouri law requires the MoPSC to complete prudence reviews of UEs FAC at least every 18 months. In August 2010, the MoPSC staff completed a prudence review of the FAC from March 1, 2009, to September 30, 2009. The MoPSC staff contends that UE should have included in the FAC calculation all costs and revenues associated with certain contract sales that were made due to the loss of Noranda load caused by a severe ice storm in January 2009. UE disagrees with the MoPSC staffs classification of these transactions and opposes their inclusion in the FAC calculation. UE recognized margin associated with these contracts of $17 million during the period reviewed by the MoPSC and an additional $25 million of margin subsequent to September 30, 2009. If the MoPSC were to agree with the staff position, and if the MoPSCs order were to be upheld by the courts on appeal, UE would be required to pass through to customers the $42 million in margin associated with these contracts resulting in a charge to UEs earnings. The MoPSC is expected to issue an order for this review in 2011. If UE were to conclude that some portion of these contested FAC amounts become probable of refund to UEs customers, a charge to earnings would be recorded for the estimated amount of refund in the period in which that decision is made. As part of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, AIC entered into financial contracts with Marketing Company (for the benefit of Genco and AERG), to lock in energy prices for 400 to 1,000 megawatts annually of its round the clock power requirements during the period June 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012, at then relevant market prices. Under the terms of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, these financial contracts are deemed prudent and AIC is permitted full recovery of their costs in rates. Volatile power prices in the Midwest can affect the amount of revenues Ameren and Genco generate by 68 Table of Contents marketing power into the wholesale and spot markets and can influence the cost of power purchased in the spot markets. With few scheduled maintenance outages in 2011 and 2012, the Merchant Generation segment expects to have available generation from its coal fired plants of 34 million megawatthours in each year. However, the Merchant Generation segments actual generation levels will be significantly influenced by whether market prices for power in those years justify the generation output, among other things. The availability and performance of Amerens and Gencos Merchant Generation fleet can materially affect their revenues. The Merchant Generation segment expects to generate 29.5 million megawatthours of power from its coal fired plants in 2011 (Genco 22 million) based on expected power prices. Should power prices rise more than expected, the Merchant Generation segment has the capacity and availability to sell more generation. The marketing strategy for the Merchant Generation segment is to optimize generation output in a low risk manner to minimize volatility of earnings and cash flow, while seeking to capitalize on its low cost generation fleet to provide solid, sustainable returns. To accomplish this strategy, the Merchant Generation segment has established hedge targets for near term years. Through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts, Marketing Company targets to hedge Merchant Generations expected output by 80% to 90% for the following year, 50% to 70% for two years out, and 30% to 50% for three years out. As of February 15, 2011, Marketing Company had hedged approximately 26 million megawatthours of Merchant Generations expected 2011 generation, at an average price of $46 per megawatthour. For 2012, Marketing Company had hedged approximately 15 million megawatthours of Merchant Generations forecasted generation sales at an average price of $50 per megawatthour. For 2013, Marketing Company had hedged approximately 7.5 million megawatthours of Merchant Generations forecasted generation sales at an average price of $42 per megawatthour. Marketing Company has also entered into capacity only sales contracts for 2011, 2012, and 2013, resulting in expected capacity only revenues related to these contracts of $47 million, $19 million, and $7 million, respectively. Any unhedged forecasted generation will be exposed to market prices at the time of sale. Prices for power have decreased significantly since mid 2008. As a result, any new physical or financial power sales may be at price levels lower than previously experienced. Current and future energy efficiency programs developed by UE, AIC and others could result in reduced demand for our electric generation and our electric and natural gas transmission and distribution services. Our regulated operations will seek a regulatory framework that allows either a return on these programs similar to the return that could be earned on supply side capital investments, or recovery of their costs, within a declining demand environment. Fuel and Purchased Power In 2010, 85% of Amerens electric generation (UE 77%, Genco 99%) was supplied by coal fired power plants. About 97% of the coal used by these plants (UE 97%, Genco 97%) was delivered by rail from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. In the past, deliveries from the Powder River Basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail maintenance, weather, and derailments. As of December 31, 2010, coal inventories for Ameren, UE and Genco were at targeted levels. However, Merchant Generation is targeting a reduction in its coal inventory, relative to previous levels, in 2011. Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause Ameren, UE and Genco to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low margin periods, buying higher cost fuels to generate required electricity, or purchasing power from other sources. Amerens fuel costs (including transportation) are expected to increase in 2011 and beyond. As of February 15, 2011, the average cost of Merchant Generations baseload hedged fuel costs, which include coal, transportation, diesel fuel surcharges, and other charges, was approximately $23.50 per megawatthour in 2011, $25 per megawatthour in 2012, and $28.50 per megawatthour in 2013. See Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report for additional information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for 2011 through 2015. Other Costs In December 2005, there was a breach of the upper reservoir at UEs Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility. This resulted in significant flooding in the local area, which damaged a state park. The rebuilt Taum Sauk plant became fully operational in April 2010. Until Amerens remaining liability insurance claims and the related litigation, as well as its pending regulatory proceeding, are resolved, among other things, we are unable to determine the total impact the breach could have on Amerens and UEs results of operations, financial position, and liquidity beyond those amounts already recognized. Certain costs associated with the Taum Sauk facility not recovered from property insurers are expected to be recoverable from UEs electric customers. As of December 31, 2010, UE had capitalized in property and plant Taum Sauk related costs of $89 million that UE believes qualify for recovery in electric rates under the terms of UEs November 2007 state of Missouri settlement agreement, and those costs were included in UEs pending electric rate increase request filed in September 2010. The inclusion of such costs in UEs electric rates is subject to review and approval by the MoPSC. Any amounts not recovered in electric rates, or otherwise, could result in charges to earnings, which 69 Table of Contents could be material. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of Taum Sauk matters. UEs Callaway nuclear plants next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage will be in the fall of 2011. During a scheduled outage, which occurs every 18 months, maintenance and purchased power costs increase, and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases, compared with non outage years. Over the next few years, we expect rising employee benefit costs, higher property taxes, and higher insurance premiums as a result of insurance market conditions and loss experience, among other things. Amerens Merchant Generation segment is expecting 2011 non fuel other operations and maintenance expenses to be approximately $310 million, which is approximately 10% greater than other operations and maintenance expenses recorded in 2010. Higher employee related costs are the primary driver for the expected increase. The reduction in carrying value for some long lived and intangible Merchant Generation assets, recognized as a result of Amerens and Gencos third quarter 2010 impairment tests, as well as a corresponding change in the useful lives for some assets, is not expected to have a material impact on Amerens or Gencos 2011 net income. On January 12, 2011, the Illinois governor signed legislation that would increase the states corporate income tax rate from the current 7.3% to 9.5% (including the replacement tax), starting in 2011. The tax rate is scheduled to decrease to 7.75% in 2015, and it is scheduled to return to 7.3%, in 2025. This corporate income tax rate increase in Illinois is expected to increase Amerens income tax expense between $5 to $10 million in 2011 (AIC $3 million to $6 million, Genco $1 million to $2 million). UE, AIC, ATXI and Marketing Company are MISO members. Each member company of MISO is responsible for a portion of MISOs market cost. Recently, some non Ameren Companies have announced their intention to leave MISO, while other companies have announced plans to study their potential inclusion into MISO. In the near term, it appears likely that more companies will exit MISO than will join it. Ameren could be negatively affected as existing MISO companies leave the RTO as Amerens operating companies would bear a larger share of MISOs market costs. At this time, Ameren is unable to estimate the effects of these MISO member changes on its results of operation, financial position, and liquidity. Other A ballot initiative passed by Missouri voters in November 2008 created a renewable energy portfolio requirement. UE and other Missouri investor owned utilities will be required to purchase or generate electricity from renewable energy sources equaling at least 2% of native load sales by 2011, with that percentage increasing in subsequent years to at least 15% by 2021, subject to a 1% limit on customer rate impacts. At least 2% of each portfolio requirement must be derived from solar energy. Compliance with the renewable energy portfolio requirement can be achieved through generation, the procurement of renewable energy, or the procurement of renewable energy credits. UE expects that any related costs or investments would ultimately be recovered in rates. In July 2010, the MoPSC issued final rules implementing the States renewable energy portfolio requirements. In addition to other concerns, UE objected to the MoPSC rules creating geographical restrictions as well as the calculation of the 1% limit on customer rates. In February 2011, the Missouri legislature rejected the contested portion of the MoPSC rules creating geographical restrictions. This legislative action allows UE to comply with the law through its own generation or the procurement of renewable energy or renewable energy credits from sources regardless of geographical location. In August 2010, UE filed an appeal with the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri. UE is appealing the portion of the MoPSC rules calculating the 1% limit on customer rates. UE cannot predict when the court will issue a ruling or the ultimate outcome of the appeal. In September 2010, President Obama signed into law the Small Business Jobs Act. That legislation includes an extension of the bonus depreciation provision to 2010, retroactive to the beginning of 2010. This provision will allow the Ameren Companies to accelerate depreciation deductions on qualifying property for federal income tax purposes that Ameren would have otherwise received over 15 or 20 years. In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Jobs Creation Act of 2010 was signed into law by President Obama. This provision allowed increased acceleration for qualifying property placed in service after September 8, 2010. Amerens preliminary estimate is that these provisions will result in a reduction of Amerens 2011 federal income tax payments of between $100 million to $150 million (UE $65 million to $85 million, AIC $35 million to $55 million, Genco $ million to $10 million) and a reduction of Amerens 2012 federal income tax payments of between $150 million to $200 million (UE $90 million to $105 million, AIC $60 million to $80 million, Genco $ million to $5 million). AICs $150 million 6.625% senior secured notes will mature in June 2011. AIC expects to use cash on hand and operating cash flows to pay the bondholders $150 million, plus interest, at the maturity date. Additionally in 2011, AIC is planning to contribute approximately $100 million to Amerens postretirement benefit plan. This cash contribution will reduce future postretirement expense. In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This law will require additional governmental regulation of derivative and OTC transactions that could expand collateral requirements. The Commodities Futures 70 Table of Contents Trading Commission has issued a number of proposed rulemakings to implement the new law. Ameren is currently evaluating the new law and the proposed rulemaking to determine their potential impact to our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Depending on how the law is ultimately interpreted in subsequent rulemaking, it could reduce the effectiveness of hedging, increasing the volatility of earnings, and could require increased collateral postings. In 2010, President Obama signed into law a health care reform bill that makes several fundamental changes to the U.S. health care system. In March 2010, Ameren recorded a $13 million charge relating to the taxation of the Medicare Part D subsidy. The Ameren Companies are currently evaluating the long term effects of this reform and the health care benefits they currently offer their employees and retirees. Additionally, Ameren will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the health care reforms, including any clarifying regulations issued to address how the provisions are to be implemented. Until those reviews are completed, Ameren is unable to estimate the effects of the new law on its results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The above items could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase Amerens stockholder value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed. The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. REGULATORY MATTERS See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report. ACCOUNTING MATTERS Critical Accounting Estimates Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. These estimates involve judgments regarding many factors which in and of themselves could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. We have outlined below the critical accounting estimates that we believe are most difficult, subjective, or complex. Any change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results. Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery Ameren, UE and AIC defer costs in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, and make investments that they assume will be collected in future rates. Regulatory environment and external regulatory decisions and requirements Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact Impact of deregulation, rate freezes, prudency reviews, and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs Basis for Judgment We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate and any other factors that may indicate whether cost recovery is probable. If facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery or that plant assets are probable of disallowance, we record a charge to earnings, which could be material. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for quantification of these assets for each of the Ameren Companies, excluding Genco. Unbilled Revenue At the end of each period, UE and AIC project expected usage and estimate the amount of revenue to record for services that have been provided to customers but not yet billed. Projecting customer energy usage Estimating impacts of weather and other usage affecting factors for the unbilled period Estimating loss of energy during transmission and delivery Basis for Judgment We base our estimate of unbilled revenue each period on the volume of energy delivered, as valued by a model of billing cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class for our service area. This figure is then adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and weather variations based on historical results. See the balance sheets for Ameren, UE and AIC, under Part II, Item 8, of this report for unbilled revenue amounts. 71 Table of Contents Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Derivative Financial Instruments We account for derivative financial instruments and measure their fair value in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance. The identification and classification of a derivative and the fair value of such derivative must be determined. See Commodity Price Risk and Fair Value of Contracts in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 8 Fair Value Measurements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Our ability to assess whether derivative contracts qualify for the NPNS exception Our ability to consume or produce notional values of derivative contracts Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility and liquidity Valuation assumptions on longer term contracts due to lack of observable inputs Effectiveness of derivatives that have been designated as hedges Counterparty default risk Basis for Judgment We determine whether to exclude the fair value of certain derivatives from valuation under the NPNS provisions of authoritative accounting guidance after assessing our intent and ability to physically deliver commodities purchased and sold. Further, our forecasted purchases and sales also support our designation of some fair valued derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. Fair value of our derivatives is measured in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, which provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When we do not have observable inputs, we use certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation. Our valuations also reflect our own assessment of counterparty default risk, using the best internal and external information available. If we were required to discontinue our use of the NPNS exception or cash flow hedge treatment for some of our contracts, the impact of changes in fair value for the applicable contracts could be material to our earnings. Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long Lived Assets, and Asset Retirement Obligations We periodically assess the carrying value of our goodwill, intangible assets, and long lived assets to determine whether they are impaired. We also review for the existence of asset retirement obligations. If an asset retirement obligation is identified, we determine its fair value and subsequently reassess and adjust the obligation, as necessary. Managements identification of impairment indicators Changes in business, industry, laws, technology, or economic and market conditions Valuation assumptions and conclusions Our assessment of market participants Estimated useful lives of our significant long lived assets Actions or assessments by our regulators Identification of an asset retirement obligation and assumptions about the timing of asset removals Basis for Judgment Annually, or whenever events indicate a valuation may have changed, we use various methodologies that we believe market participants would use to determine valuations, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization multiples, and discounted, undiscounted, and probabilistic discounted cash flow models with multiple operating scenarios. The identification of asset retirement obligations is conducted through the review of legal documents and interviews. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for quantification of our goodwill, intangible assets, and asset retirement obligations. See Note 17 Goodwill and Other Asset Impairments under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information of our goodwill, intangible asset, and long lived asset impairment evaluation and charge recorded in 2010. 72 Table of Contents Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Benefit Plan Accounting Based on actuarial calculations, we accrue costs of providing future employee benefits in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance regarding benefit plans. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations Health care cost trend rates Timing of employee retirements and mortality assumptions Ability to recover certain benefit plan costs from our ratepayers Changing market conditions impacting investment and interest rate environments Impacts of the health care reform legislation enacted in 2010 Basis for Judgment Our ultimate selection of the discount rate, health care trend rate, and expected rate of return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on our consistent application of assumption setting methodologies and our review of available historical, current, and projected rates, as applicable. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report for sensitivity of Amerens benefit plans to potential changes in these assumptions. Accounting for Contingencies We make judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, environmental remediation, the actions of various regulatory agencies, or other matters that occur in the normal course of business. We record a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. A gain contingency is not recorded until realized or realizable. Estimating financial impact of events Estimating likelihood of outcomes Regulatory and political environments and requirements Outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors Basis for Judgment The determination of a loss contingency requires significant judgment as to the expected outcome of each contingency in future periods. In making the determination as to the amount of potential loss and the probability of loss, we consider all available evidence including the expected outcome of potential litigation. We record our best estimate of a loss or the minimum value of our estimated range of outcomes if no estimate is better than another estimate within our range of estimates. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to the contingency and revise our estimates. In our evaluation of legal matters, management consults with legal counsel and relies on analysis of relevant case law and legal precedents. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 10 Callaway Nuclear Plant, and Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on the Ameren Companies contingencies. Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report. EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Amerens rates for retail electric and natural gas utility service are regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Nonretail electric rates are regulated by FERC. Rate regulation is generally based on the recovery of historical or projected costs. As a result, revenue increases could lag behind changing prices. Inflation affects our operations, earnings, stockholders equity, and financial performance. The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers. As a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years. Amerens Merchant Generation businesses do not have regulated recovery mechanisms and are therefore dependent on market prices for power to reflect rising costs. UE recovers the cost of fuel for electric generation and the cost of purchased power by adjusting rates as allowed through an FAC. AIC recovers power supply costs from electric customers by adjusting rates through a rider mechanism to accommodate changes in power prices. UE and AIC are affected by changes in the cost of electric transmission services. FERC regulates the rates charged and the terms and conditions for electric transmission services. Each RTO separately files regional transmission tariff rates for approval by FERC. All members 73 Table of Contents within that RTO are then subjected to those rates. As members of MISO, UEs and AICs transmission rates are calculated in accordance with MISOs rate formula. The transmission rate is updated in June of each year based on FERC filings. This rate is charged directly to wholesale customers. AIC also charges this rate directly to alternative retail electric suppliers. For Illinois retail customers who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier, the transmission rate is collected through a rider mechanism. This rate is not directly charged to Missouri retail customers because the MoPSC includes transmission related costs in setting bundled retail rates in Missouri. In our Missouri and Illinois retail natural gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. Ameren, UE and Genco are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent that they must purchase natural gas to run CTs. These companies have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins, and to minimize the impact to their financial statements. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, below for additional information. Also see Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on the cost recovery mechanisms discussed above. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument, derivative or nonderivative, caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates, commodity prices, and equity security prices. A derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value of some underlying asset. The following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. We handle market risks in accordance with established policies, which may include entering into various derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks, principally business, legal and operational risks, are not part of the following discussion. Our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets and to pursue market opportunities within prudent risk parameters. Our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee, which is composed of senior level Ameren officers. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with: long term and short term variable rate debt; fixed rate debt; auction rate long term debt; and defined pension and postretirement benefit plans. We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of debt instruments we have within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. For defined pension and postretirement benefit plans, we control the duration and portfolio mix of our plan assets. The following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by 1% on variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2010: Interest Expense Net Income(a) Ameren(b) $ 10 $ (6 ) UE 2 (1 ) AIC (c ) (c ) Genco 2 (1 ) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Includes intercompany eliminations. (c) Less than $1 million. The estimated changes above do not consider the potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would probably act to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted. Exchange traded contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the respective exchanges and have nominal credit risk. In all other transactions, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on the potential loss on counterparty exposure as of December 31, 2010. Our revenues are primarily derived from sales or delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and Illinois. Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and executory contracts with market risk exposures. The risk associated with trade receivables is 74 Table of Contents mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base. At December 31, 2010, no nonaffiliated customer represented more than 10%, in the aggregate, of our accounts receivable. The risk associated with AICs electric and natural gas trade receivables is also mitigated by a rate adjustment mechanism that allows AIC to recover the difference between its actual bad debt expense under GAAP and the bad debt expense included in its base rates. UE and AIC continue to monitor the impact of increasing rates on customer collections. UE and AIC make adjustments to their allowance for doubtful accounts as deemed necessary to ensure that such allowances are adequate to cover estimated uncollectible customer account balances. Ameren, UE, AIC and Genco may have credit exposure associated with off system or wholesale purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2010, Amerens, UEs, AICs and Gencos combined credit exposure to nonaffiliated non investment grade trading counterparties was $3 million, net of collateral (2009 $2 million). We establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program. It involves daily exposure reporting to senior management, master trading and netting agreements, and credit support, such as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze each counterpartys financial condition before we enter into sales, forwards, swaps, futures or option contracts, and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged lease. We estimate our credit exposure to MISO associated with the MISO Energy and Operating Reserves Market to be $53 million at December 31, 2010 (2009 $13 million). Equity Price Risk Our costs for providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, including the rate of return on plan assets. Ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in ERISA. Amerens goal is to ensure that sufficient funds are available to provide the benefits at the time they are payable and also to maximize total return on plan assets and minimize expense volatility consistent with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment management to specialists. Where appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio. Projected rates of return for each asset class were estimated after an analysis of historical experience, future expectations, and the volatility of the various asset classes. After considering the target asset allocation for each asset class, we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared with benchmark returns, and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets. In future years, the costs of such plans reflected in net income, OCI, or regulatory assets, and cash contributions to the plans could increase materially, without pension and postretirement asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our 2011 assumed return on plan assets of 8% and 7.75%, respectively. UE also maintains a trust fund, as required by the NRC and Missouri law, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning. As of December 31, 2010, this fund was invested primarily in domestic equity securities (68%) and debt securities (32%). It totaled $337 million (2009 $293 million). By maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments, UE seeks to maximize the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk. However, the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. The debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. UE actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options. UEs exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated, because UE is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs, which would include unfavorable investment results, through electric rates. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity, emission allowances, fuel, and natural gas. Amerens, UEs and Gencos risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements. Merchant Generation also seeks to sell power forward to wholesale, municipal, and industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices. We also attempt to mitigate financial risks through risk management programs and policies, which include forward hedging programs, and the use of derivative financial instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts, and financial swap contracts). However, a portion of the generation capacity of Ameren, UE and Genco is not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices. The following table shows how our earnings might decrease if power prices were to decrease by 1% on unhedged economic generation for 2011 through 2014: Net Income(a) Ameren(b) $ (17 ) UE (c ) Genco (14 ) (a) Calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 38%. (b) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (c) Less than $1 million. 75 Table of Contents Amerens forward hedging power programs include the use of derivative financial swap contracts. These swap contracts financially settle a fixed price against a floating price. The floating price is typically the realized, or settled, price at a liquid regional hub at some forward period of time. Ameren controls the use of derivative financial swap contracts with volumetric and correlation limits that are intended to mitigate any material adverse financial impact. Historically, Ameren has utilized swaps that settle against the Cinergy Hub MISO locational marginal pricing. This hub had traditionally been the most liquid location, with a strong correlation to the pricing that was realized at our generating locations. As of December 31, 2011, MISO intends to stop publishing Cinergy Hub pricing. As a result, Ameren will pursue financial hedging at the next best available regional location with sufficient liquidity. Ameren does not expect any material adverse financial impact to the outcomes of its forward hedging programs as a result of this change. Ameren will continue to pursue the best available options to fix pricing for the output of its generating units. Ameren also uses its portfolio management and trading capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy risk capital to generate additional returns. Due to our physical presence in the market, we are able to identify and pursue opportunities, which can generate additional returns through portfolio management and trading activities. All of this activity is performed within a controlled risk management process. We establish value at risk (VaR) and stop loss limits that are intended to prevent any negative material financial impact. We manage risks associated with changing prices of fuel for generation using techniques similar to those used to manage risks associated with changing market prices for electricity. Most Ameren, UE and Genco fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts. Merchant Generation does not have the ability to pass through higher fuel costs to its customers for electric operations with the exception of an immaterial percentage of the output that has been contracted with a fuel cost pass through. Prior to March 2009, UE did not have this ability either except through a general rate proceeding. The MoPSC granted UE permission to put a FAC in place beginning March 1, 2009. UE remains exposed to 5% of changes, greater or less than the amounts set in base rates, in its fuel and purchased power costs, net of off system revenues. Ameren, UE and Genco have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal to manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility. Price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures, whereby the amount of coal purchased is determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year. Ameren, UE and Genco generally purchase coal up to five years in advance, but they may purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable deals or market conditions. The strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions. UE has an ongoing need for coal to serve its native load customers and pursues a price hedging strategy consistent with this requirement. Merchant Generations forward coal requirements are dependent on the volume of power sales that have been contracted. As such, Merchant Generation strives to achieve increased margin certainty by aligning its fuel purchases with their power sales. Transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs. Ameren, UE and Genco typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility. Natural gas transportation expenses for Amerens gas distribution utility companies and the gas fired generation units of Ameren, UE and Genco are regulated by FERC through approved tariffs governing the rates, terms, and conditions of transportation and storage services. Certain firm transportation and storage capacity agreements held by the Ameren Companies include rights to extend the contracts prior to the termination of the primary term. Depending on our competitive position, we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariff rates for our requirements. In addition, coal and coal transportation costs are sensitive to the price of diesel fuel as a result of rail freight fuel surcharges. If diesel fuel costs were to increase or decrease by $0.25 a gallon, Amerens fuel expense could increase or decrease by $12 million annually (UE $7 million, Genco $4 million). As of December 31, 2010, Ameren had a price cap for approximately 89% of expected fuel surcharges in 2011. In the event of a significant change in coal prices, Ameren, UE and Genco would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources. With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel, UE has fixed priced, base price with escalation, and market priced agreements. It uses inventories to provide some price hedge to fulfill its Callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium, conversion and enrichment. There is no fuel reloading or planned maintenance outage scheduled for 2012 and 2015. UE has price hedges (including inventories) for approximately 83% of its 2011 to 2014 nuclear fuel requirements. Nuclear fuel market prices remain subject to an unpredictable supply and demand environment. UE has continued to follow a strategy of managing its inventory of nuclear fuel as an inherent price hedge. New long term uranium contracts are almost exclusively market price related with an escalating price floor. New long term enrichment contracts usually have a base price with escalation price mechanism, and may also have either a 76 Table of Contents market price related component or market based price re benchmarking. UE expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the Callaway nuclear plant, at prices that cannot now be accurately predicted. Unlike the electricity and natural gas markets, nuclear fuel markets have somewhat limited financial instruments available for price hedging, so most hedging is done through inventories and forward contracts, if they are available. With regard to the electric generating operations for Ameren, UE and Genco that are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run CTs, the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs. We optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins. Through the market allocation process, UE, AIC and Genco have been granted FTRs associated with the MISO Energy and Operating Reserves Market. In addition, Marketing Company has acquired FTRs for its participation in the PJM Northern Illinois market. The FTRs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission congestion charges related to the physical electricity business. Depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid, FTRs could result in either charges or credits. Complex grid modeling tools are used to determine which FTRs to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is a risk of incorrectly modeling the amount of FTRs needed, and there is the potential that the FTRs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges. With regard to UEs and AICs electric and natural gas distribution businesses, exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery mechanisms in place. These cost recovery mechanisms allow UE and AIC to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas supply costs. UEs and AICs strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations for our regulated customers. The effects of price volatility cannot be eliminated. However, procurement strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier, as well as the management of physical assets. The following table presents, as of December 31, 2010, the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired power plants, nuclear fuel for UEs Callaway nuclear plant, natural gas for our CTs and retail distribution, as appropriate, and purchased power needs of AIC, which does not own generation, that are price hedged over the five year period 2011 through 2015. The projected required supply of these commodities could be significantly affected by changes in our assumptions for such matters as customer demand for our electric generation and our electric and natural gas distribution services, generation output, and inventory levels, among other matters. 2011 2012 2013 2015 Ameren(a): Coal 94 % 55 % 11 % Coal transportation 100 75 28 Nuclear fuel 98 84 78 Natural gas for generation 40 2 Natural gas for distribution(b) 89 39 19 Purchased power for AIC(c) 78 56 8 UE: Coal 95 % 59 % 16 % Coal transportation 100 56 38 Nuclear fuel 98 84 78 Natural gas for generation 30 1 Natural gas for distribution(b) 90 35 19 AIC: Natural gas for distribution(b) 89 % 39 % 19 % Purchased power(c) 78 56 8 Genco: Coal 93 % 49 % 4 % Coal transportation 100 99 9 Natural gas for generation 84 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.

With regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for construction and maintenance activities, Ameren is exposed to changes in market prices for metal commodities and labor availability. See Supply for Electric Power under Part I, Item 1, of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal, nuclear power, natural gas, hydroelectric power, and oil. Also see Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Fair Value of Contracts We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, diesel, electricity, uranium, and emission allowances. Such price fluctuations may cause the following: an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sale prices under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices; market values of coal, natural gas, and uranium inventories or emission allowances that differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory; and actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that differ from anticipated cash outlays. The derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward contracts, futures, options, and swaps. Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required. The goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements. Contracts we enter into as part of our risk management program may be settled financially, settled by physical delivery, or net settled with the counterparty. See Note 7Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) changes in the fair value of all derivative contracts marked to market during the year ended December 31, 2010. We use various methods to determine the fair value of our contracts. In accordance with hierarchy levels outlined in authoritative accounting guidance, the sources we used to determine the fair value of these contracts were active quotes (Level 1), inputs corroborated by market data (Level 2), and other modeling and valuation methods that are not corroborated by market data (Level 3). All of these contracts have maturities of less than five years.
