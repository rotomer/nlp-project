ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Ameren Executive Summary Operations During 2011, Ameren remained committed to providing its customers with safe, reliable, environmentally responsible and reasonably priced energy while at the same time enhancing value for our shareholders. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois seek to earn competitive returns on their investments by improving their regulatory frameworks and seeking rate increases as needed. Amerens Merchant Generation business seeks to protect and enhance shareholder value by minimizing operating and capital spending during the current period of low power prices while advocating for regulatory policies and power market improvements that will lead to improved economics. Ameren is committed to allocating capital to projects that have an opportunity to earn a competitive return and to aligning its spending with regulatory outcomes and economic conditions. There were several developments during 2011 and early 2012 that have the potential to improve the level or predictability of earned returns at Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois. In January 2012, Ameren Illinois elected to participate in the IEIMAs performance based formula ratemaking process for electric delivery service. As a result, Ameren Illinois electric delivery service earnings in 2012 and beyond are expected to reflect performance based formula ratemaking, which will enable additional infrastructure investment and the creation of jobs. The improved infrastructure will enhance reliability and provide customers with the energy usage options made possible by smart meters. Also in January 2012, the ICC approved an increase in annual Ameren Illinois revenues for natural gas delivery service. In 2011, Ameren Missouri received rate increases for its electric and natural gas businesses. In February 2012, Ameren Missouri filed an electric rate case with the MoPSC seeking to recover its operating and capital costs and to earn a fair return on investments made to serve its customers. In addition to that pending electric rate case, in January 2012, Ameren Missouri filed its first request with the MoPSC for approval of new and expanded energy efficiency programs along with a cost recovery mechanism under the MEEIA. The MEEIA was designed to enable utilities to pursue cost effective energy efficiency programs by aligning the utilitys financial incentives with those of its customers. Also, FERC is expected to issue an order on MISOs proposal to establish a capacity market within the RTO. The MISO proposal calls for the first annual capacity auction to be held in April 2013 for the June 2013 to May 2014 planning year. Ameren supports the MISO proposal as well as MISOs efforts to increase the amount of capacity that can be shared between MISO and PJM. Ameren will continue to advocate for a multi year capacity construct to improve the functioning of power markets. The creation of a MISO capacity market would more accurately reflect the value of capacity, improve efficiency and reliability, and benefit customers over the long term. The Merchant Generation segment expects its cash flows from operating activities to exceed capital expenditures in 2012 reflecting the benefit of its forward power sales and hedging programs as well as actions taken to reduce spending. In early 2012, there has been a sharp decline in forward power prices. The decline in power prices is believed to be caused by factors such as declining natural gas prices and the stay of the CSAPR. It is unclear when legal and regulatory uncertainties related to CSAPR will be resolved and when natural gas prices will recover. As a result of the declining price of power, Merchant Generation and Genco have revised their capital spending plans. Genco is decelerating construction of its Newton energy center scrubber project, postponing installation until such time as the incremental investment necessary for completion is justified by visible market conditions. In addition, AERG has removed from its five year capital expenditure plans the previously planned precipitator upgrades at its E.D. Edwards energy center. Merchant Generation believes these actions are the best path to achieving appropriate returns on incremental environmental investments during this period of low power prices. These Merchant Generation actions will reduce capital needs by approximately $270 million from 2012 through 2014 compared to prior plans. Genco will decelerate the Newton scrubber project in a manner that preserves the value of the work commissioned to date. Genco has reduced its expected 2012 capital expenditures for the Newton scrubber project to approximately $150 million. After 2012, Genco will perform minimal amounts of ongoing construction activities such that when the economics merit completing the Newton scrubber project, the project can be completed in an orderly and cost effective manner. Ameren plans to significantly grow its investment in electric transmission assets, which are regulated by FERC. Ameren expects to invest a total of approximately $1.7 billion in transmission projects over the five year period ending in 2016. Of that total, Ameren Illinois expects to invest $900 million in transmission projects that are focused on local load growth and reliability needs. In December 2011, MISO approved the Illinois Rivers, Spoon River, and Mark Twain projects. ATX and ATXIs total investment in these three MISO approved projects is expected to be more than $1.2 billion through 2019, with potential investment of approximately $750 million from 2012 to 2016. In 2012, ATXI is moving forward with the line routing and siting process for the Illinois Rivers project. Earnings Ameren reported net income of $519 million, or $2.15 per share, for 2011 compared with net income of $139 million, or 58 cents per share, in 2010. The main factor contributing to the increase in earnings in 2011 compared with 2010 was a reduction in goodwill, impairment and other charges of $464 million, or $1.87 per share. The 2011 charges were the result of the MoPSCs July 2011 disallowance of costs of enhancements related to the rebuilding of Ameren Missouris Taum Sauk energy 32 Table of Contents center in excess of amounts recovered from property insurance, as well as new environmental rules, the primary impact of which was Gencos closure of the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers. Amerens earnings also increased in 2011, compared with 2010, because of higher electric utility rates for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois and lower interest expense. Offsetting factors included reduced electric margins in the Merchant Generation segment due to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation related expenses; lower electric sales to native load utility customers due, in part, to summer temperatures that while warmer than normal, were below those of a very hot 2010; unrealized net losses on MTM activity related to nonqualifying power hedges and fuel related contracts; and higher major storm repair expenses. Additionally, Ameren recorded a charge to earnings associated with the voluntary separation offers to eligible Ameren Missouri and Ameren Services employees during the fourth quarter of 2011. Liquidity Cash flows from operations of $1.9 billion were used to pay dividends to common stockholders of $375 million and to fund capital expenditures of $1.0 billion. At December 31, 2011, Ameren, on a consolidated basis, had available liquidity, in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under its existing credit facilities, of approximately $2.2 billion, which was a $300 million increase in the amount of available liquidity at December 31, 2010. Capital Spending From 2012 through 2016, Amerens cumulative capital spending is projected to range between $6.5 billion and $8.3 billion. Much of this spending is at Amerens rate regulated utilities, including a total of approximately $750 million at ATX and ATXI, in the aggregate, to invest in their electric transmission assets. The Merchant Generation segments capital spending is expected to be up to $450 million, primarily for environmental compliance, from 2012 through 2016. The decision to make pollution control equipment investments in Amerens Merchant Generation segment depends on whether the expected future market price for power reflects the increased cost of environmental compliance. General Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company under PUHCA 2005, administered by FERC. Amerens primary assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries. Amerens subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. These subsidiaries operate, as the case may be, rate regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution businesses, rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution businesses, and merchant electric generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Amerens common stock and the payment of other expenses by Ameren depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. Amerens principal subsidiaries are listed below. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed description of our principal subsidiaries. Ameren Missouri operates a rate regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution business, and a rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution business in Missouri. Ameren Illinois operates a rate regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois. AER consists of non rate regulated operations, including Genco, AERG, Marketing Company and Medina Valley. The Medina Valley energy center was sold in February 2012. Genco operates a merchant electric generation business in Illinois and holds an 80% ownership interest in EEI. On October 1, 2010, Ameren, CIPS, CILCO, IP, AERG and AER completed a two step corporate internal reorganization. The first step of the reorganization was the Ameren Illinois Merger. Upon consummation of the Ameren Illinois Merger, the separate legal existence of CILCO and IP ended. The second step of the reorganization involved the distribution of AERG stock from Ameren Illinois to Ameren and the subsequent contribution by Ameren of the AERG stock to AER. The Ameren Illinois Merger and the distribution of AERG stock were accounted for as transactions between entities under common control. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, assets and liabilities transferred between entities under common control were accounted for at the historical cost basis of the common parent, Ameren, as if the transfer had occurred at the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented. Amerens historical cost basis in Ameren Illinois included purchase accounting adjustments related to Amerens acquisition of CILCORP in 2003. Ameren Illinois accounted for the AERG distribution as a spinoff. Ameren Illinois transferred AERG to Ameren based on AERGs carrying value. Ameren Illinois has segregated AERGs operating results and cash flows and presented them separately as discontinued operations in its consolidated statement of income and consolidated statement of cash flows, respectively, for all periods presented prior to October 1, 2010, in this report. For Amerens financial statements, AERGs results of operations remain classified as continuing operations. See Note 16 Corporate Reorganization and Discontinued Operations under Part II, Item 8, for additional information. Effective January 1, 2010, as part of an internal reorganization, AER transferred its 80% stock ownership interest in EEI to Genco through a capital contribution. The transfer of EEI to Genco was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, whereby Genco accounted for the transfer at the historical carrying value of the parent (Ameren) as if the transfer had occurred at the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented. Amerens historical cost basis in EEI included purchase 33 Table of Contents accounting adjustments relating to Amerens acquisition of an additional 20% ownership interest in EEI in 2004. This transfer required Gencos prior period financial statements to be retrospectively combined for all periods presented. Consequently, Gencos prior period consolidated financial statements reflect EEI as if it had been a subsidiary of Genco. Ameren and Genco consolidate EEI for financial reporting purposes. The financial statements of Ameren are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, unless otherwise indicated. In addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, we present certain information in cents per share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect Amerens earnings. We believe this per share information helps readers to understand the impact of these factors on Amerens earnings per share. All references in this report to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares outstanding. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Summary Our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Weather, economic conditions, and the actions of key customers or competitors can significantly affect the demand for our services. Our results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations: winter heating and summer cooling demands. The vast majority of Amerens revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. This regulation has a material impact on the price we charge for our services. Merchant Generation sales are also subject to market conditions for power. We principally use coal, nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil for fuel in our operations. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to the global economic and political environment, weather, supply and demand, and many other factors. We have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois and Missouri natural gas delivery service businesses, a purchased power cost recovery mechanism for our Illinois electric delivery service business, and a FAC for our Missouri electric utility business. Fluctuations in interest rates and conditions in the capital and credit markets affect our cost of borrowing and our pension and postretirement benefits costs. We employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risk and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of our energy centers and transmission and distribution systems and the level of purchased power costs, operations and maintenance costs, and capital investment are key factors that we seek to control to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation was $519 million, or $2.15 per share, for 2011, $139 million, or $0.58 per share, for 2010, and $612 million, or $2.78 per share, for 2009. 2011 versus 2010 Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation increased $380 million, and earnings per share increased $1.57 in 2011 compared with 2010. The Merchant Generation segment reported net income attributable to Ameren Corporation of $45 million in 2011, compared with a $409 million net loss in 2010. Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation decreased in the Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Regulated segments by $77 million and $15 million, respectively, in 2011 compared with 2010. Compared with 2010 earnings per share, 2011 earnings were favorably affected by: reduced goodwill, impairment and other charges in the Merchant Generation segment offset, in part, by a charge to earnings related to the MoPSCs July 2011 disallowance of costs of enhancements relating to the rebuilding of the Taum Sauk energy center in excess of amounts recovered from property insurance ($1.87 per share); higher Ameren Missouri electric rates pursuant to orders issued by the MoPSC, which became effective in June 2010 and in July 2011, as well as higher Ameren Missouri natural gas rates pursuant to a MoPSC order, which became effective in late February 2011. The impact of the Ameren Missouri electric rate increases on earnings was reduced by the adoption of life span depreciation methodology, recognition in 2010 of regulatory assets for previously expensed costs in the prior year period, and increased regulatory asset amortization as directed by the rate orders (17 cents per share). These amounts exclude the unfavorable impact of the charge to earnings related to the MoPSCs disallowance of Taum Sauk rebuilding costs discussed above; lower interest expense, primarily due to the maturity and repayment of $200 million of Gencos senior secured notes in November 2010, the redemption of $66 million of Ameren Missouris subordinated deferrable interest debentures in September 2010, Ameren Illinois redemptions of $150 million of senior secured notes and $40 million of first mortgage bonds in June 2011 and September 2010, respectively, and a reduction in borrowings under credit facility agreements (12 cents per share); higher Ameren Illinois electric rates pursuant to orders issued by the ICC in 2010 (6 cents per share); the absence in 2011 of a charge for the impact on deferred taxes from changes in federal health care laws (6 cents per share); the absence in 2011 of charges recorded in 2010 for cancelled or unrecoverable projects at Ameren Missouri (6 cents per share); a reduction in operations and maintenance expense related to plant maintenance, primarily at Ameren Missouri, as fewer costs were incurred for major outages at coal fired energy centers as the scope of the outages in 2011 was not as extensive as the scope of the outages conducted in 2010 (5 cents per share); and 34 Table of Contents reduction in expense as a result of disciplined cost management efforts to align spending with regulatory outcomes and economic conditions. Compared with 2010 earnings per share, 2011 earnings were unfavorably affected by: lower electric margins in the Merchant Generation segment, largely due to lower realized revenue per megawatthour sold and higher fuel and related transportation costs (21 cents per share). This amount excludes the unfavorable impacts of net unrealized MTM activity discussed below. See Outlook for expected trends in future coal, transportation and power prices; reduced rate regulated retail sales volumes, excluding the effects of abnormal weather, as sales volumes declined due to continued economic pressure, energy efficiency measures, and customer conservation efforts as well as lower wholesale sales at Ameren Missouri due to a reduction in customers and the expiration of favorably priced contracts, among other items (15 cents per share); unrealized net losses on MTM activity primarily related to nonqualifying power hedges and fuel related contracts as well as unfavorable changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans (10 cents per share); the impact of weather conditions on electric and natural gas demand (estimated at 10 cents per share); increased operations and maintenance expenses as a result of major storms in 2011 (9 cents per share); a reduction in allowance for equity funds used during construction reflecting the 2010 completion of two scrubbers at Ameren Missouris Sioux energy center (8 cents per share); increased operations and maintenance expenses associated with voluntary separation offers to eligible Ameren Missouri and Ameren Services employees during the fourth quarter of 2011 (7 cents per share); a reduction in revenues resulting from the MoPSCs April 2011 order with respect to its FAC review for the period from March 1, 2009, to September 30, 2009, that resulted in Ameren Missouri recording an obligation to refund to its electric customers the earnings associated with certain previously recognized sales. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information (5 cents per share); and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense caused primarily by the installation of scrubbers at Ameren Missouris Sioux energy center as well as other capital additions (4 cents per share). The cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2010. 2010 versus 2009 Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation decreased $473 million, and its earnings per share decreased $2.20 in 2010 compared with 2009. Net income attributable to Ameren Corporation increased in the Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Regulated segments by $105 million and $81 million, respectively, in 2010 compared with 2009, while net income attributable to Ameren Corporation in the Merchant Generation segment decreased by $656 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Compared with 2009 earnings per share, 2010 earnings were negatively affected by: the 2010 impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long lived assets within the Merchant Generation segment due to the sustained decline in market prices for electricity, industry market multiples becoming observable at lower levels than previously estimated, and potentially more stringent environmental regulations ($2.19 per share); lower realized electric margins in the Merchant Generation segment largely due to lower realized revenue per megawatthour sold and higher fuel and related transportation costs (79 cents per share). This amount excludes the unfavorable impacts of net unrealized MTM activity on nonqualifying power hedges discussed below; higher dilution (23 cents per share) caused by an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding, largely because of a September 2009 common stock issuance, the proceeds of which were used to make investments in Amerens rate regulated utilities. The impact of dilution was offset by higher earned returns on investments at Amerens rate regulated utilities and lower financing costs; costs associated with the Callaway energy centers scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in 2010. There was no Callaway refueling and maintenance outage in 2009 (12 cents per share); increased depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily due to capital additions placed in service at the Merchant Generation segment in late 2009 and early 2010, excluding the impacts at Ameren Missouri of the May 2010 MoPSC electric rate order discussed below (9 cents per share); a reduced gain from net unrealized MTM activity on nonqualifying power hedges and from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans (6 cents per share); and the impact on deferred taxes from changes in federal health care laws (6 cents per share). Compared with 2009 earnings per share, 2010 earnings were favorably affected by: the impact of weather conditions on energy demand (estimated at 40 cents per share); higher Ameren Missouri electric rates pursuant to the MoPSC 2009 and 2010 electric rate orders effective in May 2009 and in June 2010, respectively, offset by the adoption of the life span depreciation methodology and increased regulatory asset amortization as directed by the MoPSC 2010 electric rate order (27 cents per share); the favorable impact on electric and natural gas margins in our rate regulated businesses from higher weather normalized sales volumes (exclusive of higher sales to Noranda discussed below), largely due to 35 Table of Contents improved economic conditions and higher wholesale sales margins at Ameren Missouri because of additional customers and higher priced wholesale sales contracts, among other things (20 cents per share); increased Ameren Missouri sales to Noranda as its smelter plant gradually returned to full capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2010 after a January 2009 severe ice storm significantly reduced the plants capacity (11 cents per share); a reduction in financing expenses caused primarily by an increase in the allowance for funds used during construction at Ameren Missouri for the installation of two scrubbers at its Sioux energy center (10 cents per share); higher Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas net delivery rates pursuant to the ICC 2010 rate orders, which became effective in May and November 2010 (9 cents per share); and reduced charges in 2010 relating to workforce reductions through voluntary and involuntary separation programs (4 cents per share). The cents per share information presented above is based on average shares outstanding in 2009.

Electric margins are defined as electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. Natural gas margins are defined as gas revenues less gas purchased for resale. The table covers the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. We consider electric and natural gas margins useful measures to analyze the change in profitability of our electric and natural gas operations between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information we provide in accordance with GAAP. However, these margins may not be a presentation defined under GAAP, and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or more useful than the GAAP information we provide elsewhere in this report. 2011 versus 2010 AmerenMissouri AmerenIllinoisRegulated Segment Genco Other(a) Ameren Electric revenue change: Effect of weather (estimate)(b) $ (29 ) $ (7 ) $ $ $ (36 ) Regulated rates: Higher base rates 172 29 201 Recovery of FAC under recovery(c) 89 89 Off system revenues 53 53 FAC disallowance (17 ) (17 ) Transmission services 1 (4 ) 3 Illinois pass through power supply costs (112 ) (1 ) (113 ) Energy efficiency programs and environmental remediation cost riders 6 6 Bad debt rider (17 ) (17 ) Rate regulated sales (excluding the impact of abnormal weather) (37 ) (15 ) (52 ) Wholesale revenues (43 ) (43 ) Merchant Generation sales price changes, including hedge effect (58 ) (3 ) (61 ) Net unrealized MTM losses (2 ) (4 ) (12 ) (18 ) Non rate regulated sales and other 5 (1 ) 2 11 17 Total electric revenue change $ 192 $ (121 ) $ (60 ) $ (2 ) $ 9 Fuel and purchased power change: Fuel: Merchant Generation production volume and other $ $ $ (2 ) $ 14 $ 12 Fuel and transportation costs included in base rates (84 ) (84 ) Recovery of FAC under recovery(c) (89 ) (89 ) Net unrealized MTM losses (6 ) (2 ) (8 ) Price Merchant Generation (11 ) (6 ) (17 ) Merchant Generation purchased power and other 6 (37 ) (31 ) Illinois pass through power supply costs 112 1 113 Total fuel and purchased power change $ (173 ) $ 112 $ (13 ) $ (30 ) $ (104 ) Net change in electric margins $ 19 $ (9 ) $ (73 ) $ (32 ) $ (95 ) Natural gas margins change: Effect of weather (estimate)(b) $ (1 ) $ (5 ) $ $ $ (6 ) Bad debt rider (14 ) (14 ) Change in base rates 5 3 8 Energy efficiency programs and environmental remediation cost riders (1 ) (1 ) Sales (excluding impact of abnormal weather) and other (4 ) (4 ) Net change in natural gas margins $ 4 $ (21 ) $ $ $ (17 ) 37 Table of Contents 2010 versus 2009 AmerenMissouri AmerenIllinoisRegulated Segment Genco Other(a) Ameren Electric revenue change: Effect of weather (estimate)(b) $ 134 $ 40 $ $ $ 174 Regulated rates: Higher base rates 162 41 203 Recovery of FAC under recovery(c) 60 60 Off system revenues (102 ) (102 ) Noranda sales 54 54 Transmission services 7 42 49 Illinois pass through power supply costs (83 ) 303 220 Energy efficiency programs and environmental remediation cost riders 29 29 Bad debt rider 14 14 Rate regulated sales (excluding the impact of abnormal weather) 9 16 25 Wholesale revenues (4 ) (4 ) Merchant Generation sales price changes, including hedge effect (81 ) (162 ) (243 ) 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, net of reimbursement 10 10 3 23 Net unrealized MTM gains (losses) (1 ) 50 49 Non rate regulated sales and other 10 (13 ) 50 (17 ) 30 Total electric revenue change $ 330 $ 96 $ (22 ) $ 177 $ 581 Fuel and purchased power change: Fuel: Merchant Generation production volume and other $ $ $ (38 ) $ (9 ) $ (47 ) Fuel and transportation costs included in base rates 9 9 Recovery of FAC under recovery(c) (60 ) (60 ) Net unrealized MTM losses (29 ) (18 ) (4 ) (51 ) Price Merchant Generation (51 ) (20 ) (71 ) Merchant Generation purchased power and other 11 50 61 Illinois pass through power supply costs 83 (303 ) (220 ) Total fuel and purchased power change $ (80 ) $ 83 $ (96 ) $ (286 ) $ (379 ) Net change in electric margins $ 250 $ 179 $ (118 ) $ (109 ) $ 202 Natural gas margins change: Effect of weather (estimate)(b) $ $ 1 $ $ $ 1 Bad debt rider 15 15 Change in base rates (11 ) (11 ) Energy efficiency programs and environmental remediation cost riders 1 1 Net unrealized MTM losses (6 ) (6 ) Sales (excluding impact of abnormal weather) and other 2 2 (2 ) 2 Net change in natural gas margins $ 2 $ 2 $ $ (2 ) $ 2 (a) Includes amounts for nonregistrant subsidiaries (largely made up of other Merchant Generation) and intercompany eliminations.

(c) Represents the change in the net recovery of fuel costs under the FAC recovered from customer rates, with corresponding offsets to fuel expense. 2011 versus 2010 Ameren Amerens electric margins decreased by $95 million, or 2%, in 2011 compared with 2010. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Amerens electric margins: Lower sales prices, including hedge effects, at the Merchant Generation segment due to reductions in higher margin sales resulting from the expiration of the 2006 auction power supply agreements on May 31, 2010, and lower market prices resulting in fewer opportunities for economic power sales, which decreased margins by $61 million. Excluding the estimated impact of abnormal weather, rate regulated retail sales volumes declined 1%, attributable to continued economic pressure, energy efficiency measures and customer conservation efforts, which decreased revenues by $52 million. Lower wholesale sales at Ameren Missouri due to a reduction in customers, the expiration of favorably priced contracts and the inclusion of revenues from the remaining contracts as an offset to fuel costs in the FAC beginning July 31, 2011, which decreased revenues by $43 million. Summer weather conditions in 2011 were not as hot as a very hot 2010, as evidenced by a 4% decrease in 38 Table of Contents cooling degree days, which decreased revenues by $36 million. However, weather conditions in Amerens service territory in 2011 were still warmer than normal as evidenced by 19% more cooling degree days. Net unrealized MTM losses principally at the Merchant Generation segment (primarily at Marketing Company), related to nonqualifying power hedges and fuel related contracts, which decreased margins by $26 million. Decreased utilization of Merchant Generations energy centers, primarily due to planned and unplanned outages and lower market prices resulting in fewer opportunities for economic power sales. Decreased utilization resulted in a $23 million decline in non rate regulated sales. This decline was mitigated by a $12 million decrease in Merchant Generation production volume and other costs. A $17 million reduction in revenues, recorded in the second quarter of 2011, at Ameren Missouri resulting from the MoPSCs order with respect to its FAC disallowance for the period from March 1, 2009, to September 30, 2009. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, for further information regarding the FAC prudence review.

See Operations and Maintenance in this section for additional information on a related offsetting decrease in bad debt expense. 6% higher fuel prices in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily due to higher commodity and transportation costs associated with new supply contracts, which decreased margins by $17 million. The following items had a favorable impact on Amerens electric margins in 2011 compared with 2010: Higher electric base rates at Ameren Missouri, effective June 2010 and July 2011, which increased revenues by $172 million, offset by an increase in net base fuel expense ($31 million), which was a result of higher net base fuel cost rates approved in the 2010 and 2011 MoPSC rate orders and due to higher fuel and transportation costs. Net base fuel expense is the sum of fuel and transportation costs included in base rates ( $84 million) and off system revenues (+$53 million) in the above table. See below for additional details regarding the FAC. Higher electric delivery service rates at Ameren Illinois, effective in early May and November 2010, which increased margins by $20 million, and higher wholesale revenues due to an increase in electric delivery service rates effective April 2011, which increased margins by $9 million. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, for further information regarding the 2011 wholesale distribution rate case. Increased recovery of energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs through Illinois rate adjustment mechanisms at Ameren Illinois, which increased margins by $6 million. See Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses in this section for information on a related offsetting increase in energy efficiency and environmental remediation costs. Amerens revenues associated with Illinois pass through power supply costs decreased $113 million because of lower power prices on sales primarily to nonaffiliated parties. These revenues were offset by a corresponding net decrease in purchased power. Ameren Missouri has a FAC cost recovery mechanism that allows Ameren Missouri to recover, through customer rates, 95% of changes in fuel and purchased power costs, net of off system revenues, including MISO costs and revenues, greater or less than the amount set in base rates, without a traditional rate proceeding. Ameren Missouri accrued, as a regulatory asset, fuel and purchased power costs that were greater than the amount set in base rates (FAC under recovery). Net recovery of fuel costs under the FAC through customer rates increased by $89 million in 2011, as compared with 2010, with corresponding offsets to fuel expense to reduce the previously recognized FAC regulatory asset. See below for explanations of electric and natural gas margin variances for the Ameren Missouri segment. Amerens natural gas margins decreased by $17 million, or 4%, in 2011 compared with 2010. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Amerens natural gas margins: Decreased recovery of prior years bad debt expense through the Illinois bad debt rider at Ameren Illinois, which became effective March 2010, decreased margins by $14 million. See Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses in this section for additional information on a related offsetting decrease in bad debt expense. Unfavorable winter weather conditions, as evidenced by a 6% decrease in heating degree days, which decreased revenues by $6 million. Compared to normal, Ameren experienced 3% fewer heating degree days in 2011. 4% lower native load sales volumes, excluding the estimated impact of abnormal weather, largely in the commercial and industrial sectors, attributable to continued economic pressure decreased margins by $4 million. Amerens natural gas margins were favorably affected by $8 million in 2011 compared with 2010 due to higher natural gas rates effective February 2011 at Ameren Missouri and effective in May and November 2010 at Ameren Illinois. Ameren Missouri Ameren Missouri has a FAC cost recovery mechanism, which is outlined in the Ameren margin section above. Ameren Missouris electric margins increased by $19 million, or 1%, in 2011 compared with 2010. Ameren Missouris electric margins were favorably affected by 39 Table of Contents higher electric base rates, effective in June 2010 and July 2011 ($172 million), offset by increased net base fuel expense ($31 million), which was a result of higher net base fuel cost rates approved in the 2010 and 2011 MoPSC rate orders and due to higher fuel and transportation costs. Net base fuel expense is the sum of fuel and transportation costs included in base rates ( $84 million) and off system revenues (+$53 million) in the above table. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Ameren Missouris electric margins in 2011 compared with 2010: Lower wholesale sales due to a reduction in customers, the expiration of favorably priced contracts, and the inclusion of revenues from the remaining contracts as an offset to fuel costs in the FAC beginning July 31, 2011, which decreased revenues by $43 million. Excluding the estimated impact of abnormal weather, rate regulated retail sales volumes declined by 1%, attributable to continued economic pressure, energy efficiency measures, and customer conservation efforts, which decreased revenues by $37 million. Summer weather conditions in 2011 were not as hot as a very hot 2010, as evidenced by a 3% decrease in cooling degree days, which decreased revenues by $29 million. However, weather conditions in Ameren Missouris service territory in 2011 were still warmer than normal as evidenced by 20% more cooling degree days. A $17 million reduction in revenues, recorded in the second quarter of 2011, resulting from the MoPSCs order with respect to its FAC disallowance for the period from March 1, 2009 to September 30, 2009. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, for further information regarding the FAC prudence review. Ameren Missouris natural gas margins increased by $4 million, or 5%, in 2011 compared with 2010. Ameren Missouris natural gas margins were favorably affected by higher natural gas rates, effective February 2011, which increased margins by $5 million. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment Ameren Illinois has a cost recovery mechanism for power purchased on behalf of its customers. These pass through power costs do not affect margins; however, the electric revenues and offsetting purchased power costs may fluctuate, primarily because of customer switching to alternative power providers and usage. Ameren Illinois does not generate earnings based on the resale of power, but rather on the delivery of energy. Ameren Illinois electric margins decreased by $9 million, or 1%, in 2011 compared with 2010. The following items had an unfavorable impact on electric margins: Decreased recovery of prior years bad debt expense under the Illinois bad debt rider, which became effective in March 2010, which decreased margins by $17 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for additional information on a related offsetting decrease in bad debt expense.

Increased recovery of energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs through Illinois rate adjustment mechanisms, which increased margins by $6 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for information on a related offsetting increase in energy efficiency and environmental remediation costs. Ameren Illinois natural gas margins decreased by $21 million, or 6%, in 2011 compared with 2010. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Ameren Illinois natural gas margins: Decreased recovery of prior years bad debt expense under the Illinois bad debt rider, which became effective March 2010, which decreased margins by $14 million. See Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses in this section for additional information on a related offsetting decrease in bad debt expense. Unfavorable winter weather conditions, as evidenced by a 5% decrease in heating degree days, decreased revenues by $5 million. However, compared to normal, Ameren Illinois experienced in 2011 a 2% decrease in heating degree days. Native load sales volumes declined by 4%, excluding the estimated impact of abnormal weather, largely in the commercial and industrial sectors, attributable to continued economic pressure, which decreased revenues by $4 million. Ameren Illinois gas margins were favorably affected by $3 million due to higher natural gas rates effective in May and November 2010. Merchant Generation Merchant Generations electric margins decreased by $112 million, or 14%, in 2011 compared with 2010. See below for explanations of electric margin variances for the Merchant Generation segment. 40 Table of Contents Genco Gencos electric margins decreased by $73 million, or 13%, in 2011 compared with 2010. The following items had an unfavorable impact on electric margins: Lower revenues allocated to Genco under its power supply agreement (Genco PSA) with Marketing Company. There was a smaller pool of money to allocate because of reductions in higher margin sales, after the expiration of long term contracts and because of lower market prices. However, in accordance with the Genco PSA, Genco was allocated a higher percentage of revenues from the pool because of higher reimbursable expenses and greater levels of generation relative to AERG. Genco also experienced lower market prices associated with EEIs power supply agreement with Marketing Company (EEI PSA). The combined impact of lower market prices under both power supply agreements resulted in an unfavorable price variance, which reduced revenues by $58 million. The decrease in revenues was mitigated by a favorable settlement of a contract dispute with a large customer in the second quarter of 2011. 5% higher fuel prices, primarily due to higher commodity and transportation costs associated with escalations in existing transportation agreements and new commodity supply agreements, which decreased margins by $11 million. Net unrealized MTM activity on fuel related transactions, primarily associated with financial instruments that were acquired to mitigate the risk of rising diesel fuel price adjustments embedded in coal transportation contracts, and on nonqualifying power hedges, which decreased margins by $10 million. Gencos energy center utilization in 2011 was comparable with 2010. Gencos production volume increased electric revenues by $2 million, which was offset by a $2 million increase in Merchant Generation production volume and other costs. Gencos average capacity factor remained unchanged at 71% in 2011 and 2010, but Gencos equivalent availability factor decreased to 86% in 2011, compared with 88% in 2010. Other Merchant Generation Electric margins from Amerens other Merchant Generation operations, primarily AERG and Marketing Company, decreased by $39 million, or 16%, in 2011 compared with 2010. The following items had an unfavorable impact on electric margins: Decreased energy center utilization at AERG, primarily due to planned and unplanned outages and lower market prices resulting in fewer opportunities for economic power sales. AERGs lower production volume decreased electric revenues by $25 million, mitigated by a $14 million decline in Merchant Generation production volume and other costs. AERGs average capacity factor decreased to 73% in 2011, compared with 75% in 2010, and AERGs equivalent availability factor decreased to 81% in 2011, compared with 85% in 2010. Unfavorable net unrealized MTM activity, principally at Marketing Company, largely related to nonqualifying power hedges, which decreased margins by $15 million. 6% higher fuel prices at AERG, primarily due to higher commodity and transportation costs associated with escalations in existing transportation agreements and new commodity supply agreements, decreased margins by $6 million. Lower revenues allocated to AERG under its power supply agreement (AERG PSA) with Marketing Company. There was a smaller pool of money to allocate because of reductions in higher margin sales, after the expiration of long term contracts and because of lower market prices. In accordance with the AERG PSA, AERG was also allocated a lower percentage of revenues from the pool because of lower reimbursable expenses and lower levels of generation relative to Genco. The lower market prices resulted in an unfavorable price variance, which decreased revenues by $3 million. The decrease in revenues was mitigated by a favorable settlement of a contract dispute with a large customer in the second quarter of 2011. 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Amerens electric margins increased by $202 million, or 5%, in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items had a favorable impact on Amerens electric margins: Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 52% increase in cooling degree days, which increased revenues by $174 million. Weather conditions in Amerens service territory were warmer than normal, as evidenced by 35% more cooling degree days. Higher electric base rates at Ameren Missouri, effective March 2009 and June 2010, which increased revenues by $162 million, offset by net base fuel expense ($93 million), which was a result of higher net base fuel cost rates approved in the 2010 MoPSC rate order and due to higher fuel and transportation costs and reduced off system revenues. Net base fuel expense is the sum of fuel and transportation costs included in base rates (+$9 million) and off system revenues ( $102 million) in the above table. See below for additional details regarding the FAC. Increased Ameren Missouri sales to Noranda in 2010, as its smelter plant gradually returned to full capacity in March 2010, after a severe January 2009 storm significantly reduced the plants capacity, which increased revenues by $54 million. Higher transmission revenues primarily associated with higher FERC regulated transmission rates at Ameren Illinois, which increased margins by $49 million. Higher rates were due, in part, to a significant increase in transmission assets placed into service at Ameren Illinois during 2009, higher equity levels as a result of Amerens capital contributions to Ameren Illinois in 2009 to improve its credit profile, and mild 2009 weather. 41 Table of Contents Higher electric delivery service rates at Ameren Illinois, effective in early May and November 2010, as well as the adjustment of residential electric delivery rates effective in October 2009, to recover the full increase of IPs 2008 ICC rate order, which increased margins by $41 million. Net unrealized MTM activity principally at the Merchant Generation segment (primarily at Marketing Company), related to nonqualifying power hedges, which increased margins by $49 million. Increased recovery of energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs through Illinois rate adjustment mechanisms at Ameren Illinois, which increased margins by $29 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for information on a related offsetting increase in energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs. Excluding the impact of Ameren Missouris increased sales to Noranda and the estimated impact of abnormal weather, rate regulated retail sales volumes increased by 3%, largely because of improved economic conditions, which increased revenues by $25 million. A reduction in the impact of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, which increased margins by $23 million. Increased recovery of prior years bad debt expense through the Illinois bad debt rider at Ameren Illinois, which became effective March 2010, which increased margins by $14 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for additional information on a related offsetting increase in bad debt expense. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Amerens electric margins for 2010 compared with 2009: Reductions in higher margin sales at the Merchant Generation segment after the expiration of the 2006 auction power supply agreements on May 31, 2010, and lower market prices that resulted in fewer opportunities for economic power sales, which decreased margins by $243 million. 14% higher fuel prices in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily due to higher commodity and transportation costs associated with new supply contracts, which decreased margins by $71 million. In the first quarter of 2009, the reversal of previously unrealized losses related to regulatory assets resulted in the recognition of a $29 million net MTM gain on energy and fuel related contracts at Ameren Missouri. After the implementation of Ameren Missouris FAC in March 2009, Ameren Missouris net MTM gains or losses no longer affect electric margins. Net unrealized MTM activity at the Merchant Generation segment on fuel related transactions, primarily associated with financial instruments acquired to mitigate the risk of rising diesel fuel price adjustments embedded in coal transportation contracts, reduced margins by $20 million. Amerens Illinois pass through power supply costs reflect lower power prices and the expiration of intercompany power supply agreements between Ameren Illinois and Marketing Company. Ameren Illinois purchased power from Marketing Company from January 1, 2007, through May 31, 2010, under power supply agreements entered into following a 2006 Illinois power procurement auction. The purchases and sales under these agreements were eliminated in consolidation for Amerens financial statements. Subsequent to the expiration of these agreements in May 2010, Marketing Companys power sales and Ameren Illinois power purchases have been made primarily with nonaffiliated parties. As a result, Amerens consolidated revenues increased by a net $220 million in 2010 compared with 2009. These revenues were offset by a corresponding $220 million net increase in purchased power costs. Ameren Missouri has a FAC cost recovery mechanism that allows Ameren Missouri to recover, through customer rates, 95% of changes in fuel and purchased power costs, net of off system revenues, including MISO costs and revenues, greater or less than the amount set in base rates, without a traditional rate proceeding. Ameren Missouri accrued, as a regulatory asset, fuel and purchased power costs that were greater than the amount set in base rates (FAC under recovery). Net recovery of fuel costs under the FAC through customer rates increased by $60 million in 2010, as compared with 2009, with corresponding offsets to fuel expense to reduce the previously recognized FAC regulatory asset. See below for explanations of electric and natural gas margin variances for the Ameren Missouri segment. Amerens natural gas margins increased by $2 million, or less than 1%, in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items had a favorable impact on Amerens natural gas margins: Increased recovery of prior years bad debt expense through the Illinois bad debt rider at Ameren Illinois, effective March 2010, which increased margins by $15 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for additional information on a related offsetting increase in bad debt expense. Favorable higher margin customer mix that was mitigated by a 2% decrease in sales volumes, which increased margins by $2 million. The following items had an unfavorable impact on Amerens natural gas margins in 2010 compared with 2009: Lower natural gas rates effective early May 2010 at Ameren Illinois, which reduced margins by $11 million. The absence of net unrealized MTM gains in 2010 of $6 million on natural gas swaps. Ameren Missouri Ameren Missouri has a FAC cost recovery mechanism as discussed in the Ameren margin discussion above. 42 Table of Contents Ameren Missouris electric margins increased by $250 million, or 13%, in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items had a favorable impact on Ameren Missouris electric margins: Higher electric base rates, effective March 2009 and June 2010, which increased revenues by $162 million, offset by net base fuel expense ($93 million), which was a result of higher net base fuel cost rates approved in the 2010 MoPSC rate order and due to higher fuel and transportation costs and reduced off system revenues. Net base fuel expense is the sum of fuel and transportation costs included in base rates (+$9 million) and off system revenues ( $102 million) in the above table. Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 44% increase in cooling degree days, which increased revenues by $134 million. Weather conditions in Ameren Missouris service territory were warmer than normal as evidenced by 45% more cooling degree days. Increased sales to Noranda in 2010 as its smelter plant gradually returned to full capacity in March 2010, after a severe January 2009 storm significantly reduced the plants capacity, which increased electric revenues by $54 million. Taum Sauk energy centers return to service. Although Taum Sauk was not available to generate electricity for off system revenues during 2009, Ameren Missouri had included $19 million in the calculation of the FAC as if Taum Sauk had generated off system revenues. Upon Taum Sauks return to service in April 2010, Ameren Missouris margins increased. The adjustment factor was eliminated from the FAC calculation, which increased margins by $12 million. Excluding the impact of increased sales to Noranda and the estimated impact of abnormal weather, rate regulated retail sales volumes increased by less than 1%, largely because of improved economic conditions, which increased revenues by $9 million. Ameren Missouris electric margin was unfavorably affected by the reversal of previously unrealized losses to regulatory assets, which resulted in the recognition of a $29 million net MTM gain on energy and fuel related contracts in the first quarter of 2009. This benefit did not recur in 2010. After the implementation of the FAC in March 2009, net MTM gains or losses no longer affect electric margins. Ameren Missouris natural gas margins increased by $2 million, or 3%, in 2010 compared with 2009 because of a 2% increase in sales volumes, largely due to improved economic conditions. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment Ameren Illinois has a cost recovery mechanism for power purchased on behalf of its customers. These pass through power costs do not affect margins; however, the electric revenues and offsetting purchased power costs may fluctuate, primarily because of customer switching to alternative providers and usage. Ameren Illinois electric margins increased by $179 million, or 20%, in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items had a favorable impact on electric margins: Higher transmission revenues primarily associated with higher FERC regulated transmission rates, which increased revenues by $42 million. Higher rates were due, in part, to an increase in transmission assets placed into service during 2009, higher equity levels resulting from Amerens capital contributions to IP in 2009, and mild 2009 weather. Higher electric delivery service rates, effective in early May and November 2010, as well as the adjustment of residential electric delivery rates effective October 1, 2009, at IP to recover the full increase of the 2008 ICC rate order, which increased margins by $41 million. Favorable weather conditions, as evidenced by a 65% increase in cooling degree days, which increased revenues by $40 million. Weather conditions in Ameren Illinois service territory were warmer than normal, as evidenced by 23% more cooling degree days. Increased recovery of energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs through Illinois rate adjustment mechanisms, which increased margins by $29 million. See Operations and Maintenance in this section for information on a related offsetting increase in energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs.

The absence of net unrealized MTM gains in 2010 of $6 million on natural gas swaps, as occurred in 2009. 43 Table of Contents Merchant Generation Merchant Generations electric margins decreased by $232 million, or 23%, in 2010 compared with 2009. See below for explanations of electric margin variances for the Merchant Generation segment. Genco Gencos electric margins decreased by $118 million, or 18%, in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items had an unfavorable impact on electric margins: Lower revenues allocated to Genco under its power supply agreement (Genco PSA) with Marketing Company. There was a smaller pool of money to allocate because of reductions in higher margin sales, after the expiration of older long term contracts and because of lower market prices. The lower market prices associated with the Genco PSA were mitigated by higher market prices associated with EEIs power supply agreement with Marketing Company (EEI PSA). The net impact of lower market prices under both power supply agreements reduced electric revenues by $81 million. In accordance with the Genco PSA, Genco was also allocated a lower percentage of revenues from the pool because of lower reimbursable expenses and lower generation relative to AERG. 14% higher fuel prices, primarily due to higher commodity and transportation costs associated with new supply contracts, which decreased margins by $51 million. Net unrealized MTM activity on fuel related transactions primarily associated with financial instruments that were acquired to mitigate the risk of rising diesel fuel price adjustments embedded in coal transportation contracts, which reduced margins by $19 million.

Increased energy center utilization, primarily due to more economic sales opportunities and a reduction in transmission constraints, which previously limited the period in which power could be sold. In addition, one of Gencos coal fired energy centers experienced a transformer fire in September 2009, which put two units out of service for a time in 2009. The higher production volume contributed to the $50 million increase in electric revenues, which was mitigated by higher Merchant Generation production volume and other costs of $38 million. Gencos baseload coal fired energy centers average capacity factor increased to 71% in 2010, compared with 67% in 2009, and Gencos equivalent availability factor increased to 88% in 2010, compared with 82% in 2009. Other Merchant Generation Electric margins from Amerens other Merchant Generation operations, primarily AERG and Marketing Company, decreased by $114 million, or 32%, in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items had an unfavorable impact on electric margins: Lower revenues allocated to AERG under its power supply agreement (AERG PSA) with Marketing Company. There was a smaller pool of money to allocate because of reductions in higher margin sales after the expiration of older long term contracts and because of lower market prices. These items reduced electric margins by $162 million. However, in accordance with the AERG PSA, AERG was allocated a greater percentage of revenues from the pool because of higher reimbursable expenses and higher generation relative to Genco. 19% higher fuel prices at AERG primarily due to higher commodity and transportation costs associated with new supply contracts, which decreased margins $20 million. The following items had a favorable impact on the electric margins of other Merchant Generation operations in 2010 compared with 2009: Net unrealized MTM activity at Marketing Company improved margins by $46 million, largely related to nonqualifying power hedges. A reduction in the impact of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement at AERG, which increased margins by $4 million. Increased energy center utilization at AERG, primarily due to more opportunities for economic sales and a reduction in energy center outages.

AERGs baseload coal fired energy centers average capacity factor increased to 75% in 2010, compared with 69% in 2009, while AERGs equivalent availability factor increased to 85% in 2010, compared with 78% in 2009. Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 2011 versus 2010 Ameren Corporation Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between 2011 and 2010. The following items reduced other operations and maintenance expenses between years: Charges in 2010 of $22 million due to cancelled or unrecoverable projects at Ameren Missouri that did not recur in 2011. A decrease of $20 million in plant maintenance costs, primarily because the scope of the outages in 2011 were not as extensive as the scope of the outages performed in 2010. Costs associated with the 2011 refueling and maintenance outage at Ameren Missouris Callaway energy center were consistent with costs incurred for the 2010 refueling and maintenance outage. 44 Table of Contents A $17 million decrease in bad debt expense. Bad debt expense decreased primarily because of adjustments under the Ameren Illinois bad debt rider mechanism. Expense recorded under the Ameren Illinois bad debt rider mechanism is recovered through customer billings, with no overall effect on net income. A $5 million decrease in employee benefit costs, primarily because of adjustments under Ameren Missouris pension and postretirement benefit cost tracker. Disciplined cost management efforts to align spending with regulatory outcomes and economic conditions. The following items increased other operations and maintenance expenses between years: A $34 million increase in storm related repair costs, due to major storms in 2011. Recognition of $28 million of employee severance costs related to the voluntary separation offers to eligible Ameren Missouri and Ameren Services employees in 2011, $27 million of which Ameren Missouri will seek to recover in its pending electric rate case. A reduction in other operations and maintenance expenses in 2010 by $11 million for a May 2010 MoPSC rate order, which resulted in the recording of regulatory assets related to 2009 employee severance costs and storm costs. An unfavorable change of $9 million in unrealized net MTM adjustments between years, resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans. A $5 million increase in Ameren Illinois energy efficiency and environmental remediation costs, which are recovered through customer billings and offset by increased revenues, with no overall impact on net income. Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Ameren Missouri Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between years. The following items increased other operations and maintenance expenses between years: Recognition of $27 million of employee severance costs because of a voluntary separation plan in 2011.

A reduction in other operations and maintenance expenses in 2010 by $3 million for a May 2010 ICC rate order, which resulted in the recording of a regulatory asset related to 2009 employee severance costs. The following items reduced other operations and maintenance expenses between years: A $19 million reduction in bad debt expense. Adjustments of $31 million under the bad debt rider mechanism were partially offset by higher uncollectible expense. A reduction of $5 million in non storm related distribution maintenance expenditures due, in part, to cost management efforts. Merchant Generation and Genco Other operations and maintenance expenses were comparable between years in the Merchant Generation segment as increased employee benefit costs, primarily pension costs, as well as higher plant maintenance costs resulting from increased planned outages at AERG, mitigated the favorable impact of property sale gains at Genco. Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased by $12 million in 2011 at Genco, primarily because of a $7 million increase in gains on property sales. 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Other operations and maintenance expenses increased by $53 million in 2010 compared with 2009. 45 Table of Contents The following items increased other operations and maintenance expenses between years: Increased plant maintenance and labor costs of $39 million associated with a refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway energy center and an increase of $16 million for other scheduled coal fired plant outages, the installation of scrubbers at Ameren Missouris Sioux energy center, and other maintenance work. There was no Callaway energy center refueling and maintenance outage in 2009. A $46 million increase in bad debt expense. The July 2009 capitalization and recovery of prior years bad debt expense under the Ameren Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism (net of a related donation for customer assistance programs) reduced bad debt expense in 2009. Additionally, bad debt expense increased in 2010, because of amortization of regulatory assets set up in conjunction with the Ameren Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism in 2009. Amortization expense associated with these regulatory assets was offset by increased revenues through collection from customers, with no overall impact on net income. Increased Ameren Illinois energy efficiency program costs and environmental remediation costs of $30 million. Energy efficiency program costs are allowed to be recovered from customers under the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement; environmental remediation costs associated with MGPs are recoverable from customers through Ameren Illinois environmental adjustment rate riders. Accordingly, these costs are offset by increased revenues, with no overall impact on net income. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. An unfavorable change of $7 million in unrealized net MTM adjustments between years, resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans. The following items reduced other operations and maintenance expenses between years: The absence in 2010 of major storms, such as those in 2009, which resulted in a $27 million reduction in other operations and maintenance expenses. Severance costs of $17 million for employee separation programs recognized in 2009, as compared with $4 million in 2010. A May 2010 MoPSC electric rate order, which resulted in Ameren Missouri recording regulatory assets in 2010 related to employee severance costs, and storm costs incurred in 2009, which decreased expenses by $11 million. A reduction in labor costs of $10 million, primarily because of staff reductions. Items that unfavorably affected Ameren in 2009 that did not recur in 2010: a $5 million penalty incurred for the termination of a heavy forgings contract associated with efforts to build a new nuclear unit at Ameren Missouris Callaway energy center and a $5 million write off of Amerens investment in a supply acquisition partnership. A gain on the sale of property interests at Genco recognized in 2010. Variations in other operations and maintenance expenses in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Ameren Missouri Other operations and maintenance expenses increased by $51 million in 2010. The following items increased other operations and maintenance expenses between years: Plant maintenance and labor costs increased by $39 million as a result of the Callaway energy center refueling and maintenance outage and by $34 million for other scheduled coal fired plant outages, the installation of scrubbers at the Sioux energy center, and other maintenance work and plant related costs. An unfavorable change of $4 million in unrealized net MTM adjustments between years resulting from changes in the market value of investments used to support Amerens deferred compensation. Higher bad debt expense of $5 million, primarily due to higher customer billings resulting from rate increases and weather conditions. The following items reduced other operations and maintenance expenses between years: The absence of major storms, such as those in 2009, which resulted in a decrease in other operations and maintenance expenses of $13 million. The recording of regulatory assets in 2010 related to employee severance costs and storm costs incurred in 2009, as discussed above. The absence of severance costs for employee separation programs and the absence of the forgings contract penalty recognized in 2009, as discussed above. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment Other operations and maintenance expenses increased by $45 million in 2010. The following items increased other operations and maintenance expenses between years: A $40 million increase in bad debt expense resulting from the July 2009 capitalization and recovery of prior years bad debt expense under the Ameren Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism (net of a related donation for customer assistance programs), which decreased bad debt expense in 2009, and the amortization in 2010 of regulatory assets set up in 46 Table of Contents conjunction with the Ameren Illinois bad debt rate adjustment mechanism in 2009. Energy efficiency and environmental remediation costs increased by $30 million, as discussed above. The following items reduced other operations and maintenance expenses between years: The absence of major storms in 2010, as compared with storm costs of $16 million in 2009. A reduction of $9 million in employee benefit costs due, in part, to the absence of severance costs in 2010 such as those incurred in 2009. Merchant Generation Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased by $46 million in 2010 in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily because of variations at Genco, as discussed below. Additionally, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased at AERG, primarily because of lower labor costs due to staff reductions, and reduced severance costs due to employee separation programs that were implemented in 2009. Genco Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased by $35 million in 2010. Plant maintenance costs were lower by $16 million due to the retirement in 2009 of two generation units at Gencos Meredosia energy center and other reductions in required maintenance work. Additionally, other operations and maintenance costs were lower due to a $7 million reduction in employee benefit costs, due, in part, to reduced severance costs because of employee separation programs in 2009, a $5 million decline in labor costs resulting from staff reductions, and a property sale gain in 2010. Goodwill, Impairment and Other Charges The following table summarizes goodwill, impairment and other charges for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009: Long lived Assets andRelatedCharges Emission Allowances Goodwill Total 2011: AMO $ 89 $ $ $ 89 Genco 34 1 35 AERG 1 1 Ameren $ 123 $ 2 $ $ 125 2010: Genco $ 64 $ 41 $ 65 $ 170 AERG 37 27 355 419 Ameren $ 101 $ 68 $ 420 $ 589 2009: Genco $ 6 $ $ $ 6 AERG 1 1 Ameren $ 7 $ $ $ 7 See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 15 Commitment and Contingencies, and Note 17 Goodwill, Impairment and Other Charges under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Ameren Corporation Goodwill, impairment and other charges decreased by $464 million in 2011. Ameren Missouri and Genco recorded long lived asset impairments and related charges in 2011, which are discussed individually below. Additionally, Ameren and Genco recorded intangible asset impairment charges in 2011 relating to emission allowances of $2 million and $1 million, respectively. Larger impairments were recorded in 2010, when Ameren recognized noncash, pretax impairment charges relating to goodwill, long lived assets, and emission allowances within the Merchant Generation segment. The impairments recorded in 2010 in the Merchant Generation segment were caused by a sustained decline in market prices for electricity, industry market multiples becoming observable at lower levels than previously estimated, and potentially more stringent environmental regulations being enacted. Ameren Missouri In July 2011, the MoPSC issued an electric rate order that disallowed the recovery of costs of enhancements relating to the rebuilding of the Taum Sauk energy center in excess of the amounts recovered from property insurance. As a result, Ameren Missouri recorded a pretax charge to earnings of $89 million in 2011. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on the disallowance, including Ameren Missouris appeal of the MoPSCs July 2011 electric rate order. Merchant Generation and Genco At the end of 2011, Genco ceased operations of its Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers. The closure of these energy centers was primarily the result of the expected cost of complying with the CSAPR and the MATS. Genco determined that environmental compliance options for these four units were uneconomical. Another factor driving the closure of these energy centers was a lack of a multiyear capacity market managed by MISO, without which Genco was not positioned to make the substantial investment for environmental controls that would be required to keep these units in service. As a result of these closures, Ameren and Genco each recorded a charge to earnings in 2011 of $34 million. Larger impairments were recorded in 2010, when Ameren and Genco recognized noncash, pretax impairment charges relating to goodwill, long lived assets, and emission allowances. In 2009, Genco recorded asset impairment charges of $6 million as a result of the termination of a rail line extension project at a subsidiary of Genco and to adjust the carrying value of an office building owned by Genco to its estimated fair value as of December 31, 2009. In addition, AERG recorded an asset impairment charge of $1 million to adjust the carrying value of its Indian Trails generation facilitys estimated fair value as of December 31, 2009. 47 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization 2011 versus 2010 Ameren Corporation Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $20 million in 2011 compared with 2010, because of items noted below. Partially mitigating these increases was an $8 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expenses at Ameren Services, primarily because of computer equipment becoming fully depreciated during 2011. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Ameren Missouri Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $26 million in 2011, primarily because of increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the installation of scrubbers at the Sioux energy center and other capital additions. Additionally, an increase in Ameren Missouris annual depreciation rates as a result of the 2010 MoPSC electric rate order resulted in higher depreciation and amortization expenses. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $5 million in 2011, primarily because of capital additions. Merchant Generation and Genco Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable between years in the Merchant Generation Segment and at Genco. 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Amerens depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $40 million in 2010 compared with 2009, because of items noted below. Variations in depreciation and amortization expenses in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Ameren Missouri Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $25 million in 2010, primarily because of capital additions and an increase in Ameren Missouris annual depreciation rates due largely to the adoption of the life span depreciation methodology as a result of the 2010 MoPSC electric rate order. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $6 million in 2010, primarily because of a reduction in amortization of regulatory assets. An ICC rate order in April 2010 extended the amortization period of the IP integration related regulatory asset. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part lI, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Merchant Generation and Genco Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $20 million in 2010 in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily because depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $17 million in 2010 at Genco, due to capital additions and increased depreciation rates resulting from depreciation studies performed in 2009. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2011 versus 2010 Ameren Corporation Taxes other than income taxes increased by $8 million in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily because of items noted below at Ameren Missouri. Variations in taxes other than income taxes in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Ameren Missouri Taxes other than income taxes increased by $11 million in 2011, primarily because of increased property taxes, due to higher state and local assessments and higher tax rates, and higher gross receipts taxes from increased revenues. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between years. Increased property taxes in 2011, primarily due to higher tax rates, were mitigated by the absence of franchise taxes that were incurred in 2010 in association with the Ameren Illinois Merger. Merchant Generation and Genco Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between years in the Merchant Generation Segment and at Genco. 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Taxes other than income taxes increased by $29 million in 2010 compared with 2009, because of items noted below. 48 Table of Contents Variations in taxes other than income taxes in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Ameren Missouri Taxes other than income taxes increased by $28 million in 2010, primarily because of higher gross receipts taxes as a result of increased sales, and because of increased property taxes due to higher assessed tax rates in Missouri. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment and Merchant Generation Taxes other than income taxes were comparable between years in the Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment, in the Merchant Generation segment, and at Genco. Other Income and Expenses 2011 versus 2010 Ameren Corporation Miscellaneous income, net of expenses, decreased by $11 million in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily because of items noted below. Variations in miscellaneous income, net of expenses, in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Ameren Missouri Miscellaneous income, net of expenses, decreased by $19 million in 2011, primarily because of reduced allowance for equity funds used during construction. Allowance for equity funds used during construction was higher in 2010, primarily due to scrubbers being constructed at Ameren Missouris Sioux energy center, which were placed in service in late 2010. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment Miscellaneous income, net of expenses, increased by $7 million in 2011, primarily because of reduced expenses associated with customer assistance programs. Merchant Generation and Genco Miscellaneous income, net of expenses, was comparable between years in the Merchant Generation Segment and at Genco. 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Miscellaneous income, net of expenses, increased by $9 million in 2010 compared with 2009, because of items noted below. Variations in miscellaneous income, net of expenses, in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Ameren Missouri Miscellaneous income, net of expenses, increased by $14 million in 2010, primarily because of higher allowance for equity funds used during construction associated with a project to install scrubbers at Ameren Missouris Sioux energy center, reduced, in part, by increased charitable contributions. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment Ameren Illinois had net miscellaneous expense of $6 million in 2010, compared with net miscellaneous income of $2 million in 2009. Interest income decreased by $5 million in 2010 compared with 2009, because the CIPS note receivable from Genco matured on May 1, 2010. Merchant Generation and Genco Miscellaneous income, net of expenses, was comparable between years in the Merchant Generation Segment and at Genco. Interest Charges 2011 versus 2010 Ameren Corporation Interest charges decreased by $46 million in 2011 compared with 2010, because of items noted below and because of reduced credit facility borrowings at Ameren. Variations in interest charges in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Ameren Missouri Interest charges decreased by $4 million in 2011, primarily because of a reduction in interest charges associated with uncertain tax positions of $6 million, the redemption of $66 million of subordinated deferrable interest debentures in September 2010, and reduced amortization of credit facility fees. Offsetting these favorable items was a reduction in interest charges in 2010 due to the May 2010 MoPSC electric rate order. The rate order resulted in a reduction of interest charges of $10 million in 2010, through the recording of a regulatory asset for recovery of bank credit facility fees incurred in 2009. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment Interest charges decreased by $7 million in 2011, primarily because of the redemption of $150 million of senior secured notes in June 2011 and the redemption of $40 million of first mortgage bonds in September 2010. 49 Table of Contents Merchant Generation Interest charges decreased by $28 million in 2011 in the Merchant Generation segment because of items discussed below at Genco, and because of reduced intercompany borrowings at AERG. Genco Interest charges decreased by $15 million in 2011 at Genco, primarily because of the maturity and repayment of $200 million of senior unsecured notes in November 2010. 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Interest charges decreased by $11 million in 2010 compared with 2009, because of items noted below. The decreases below were mitigated by additional interest charges resulting from the issuance of $425 million of senior notes by Ameren in May 2009. Variations in interest charges in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Ameren Missouri Interest charges decreased by $16 million in 2010. Interest charges were reduced by $10 million because of a May 2010 MoPSC electric rate order, as discussed above. Additionally, interest charges were reduced by an increase in allowance for borrowed funds used during construction associated with a project to install scrubbers at the Sioux energy center. Partially reducing the above benefits was an increase in interest charges associated with the issuance of $350 million of senior secured notes in March 2009. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment Interest charges decreased by $10 million in 2010, primarily because of the maturity of $250 million of first mortgage bonds in June 2009. Merchant Generation and Genco Interest charges increased by $14 million in 2010 in the Merchant Generation segment and $17 million at Genco, primarily because of the issuance of $250 million of senior unsecured notes at Genco in November 2009. Income Taxes The following table presents effective income tax rates for the registrants and by segment for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Ameren 37 % 68 %(a) 35 % Ameren Missouri 36 35 33 Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment 39 39 37 Genco 42 (b ) 38 Merchant Generation 41 (c ) 38 (a) The effective tax rate was 36% for 2010, after excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. (b) The effective tax rate was 40% for 2010, after excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. (c) The effective tax rate was 30% for 2010, after excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. 2011 versus 2010 Ameren Corporation Amerens effective tax rate was lower in 2011 than in 2010, primarily due to the impact of the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge in 2010. See Note 17 Goodwill, Impairment and Other Charges under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on the goodwill impairment charges. In addition, there was a noncash, after tax charge to earnings of $13 million, in the first quarter of 2010, to reduce deferred tax assets. The charge to earnings was recorded because of legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2010 that resulted in retiree health care costs no longer being deductible for tax purposes to the extent an employers postretirement health care plan receives federal subsidies that provide retiree prescription drug benefits equivalent to Medicare prescription drug benefits. This was offset, in part, by the impact of the increased Illinois statutory tax rate effective at the beginning of 2011, along with lower favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2011 compared with 2010, changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions, and the decreased impact of federal and state tax credits. Variations in effective tax rates in Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Ameren Missouri Ameren Missouris effective tax rate was higher, primarily because of lower favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities in 2011 compared to 2010, offset, in part, by the effect of the change in the tax treatment of retiree health care costs in 2010 and changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment Ameren Illinois Regulated Segments effective tax rate was comparable between years. Merchant Generation The effective tax rate was higher in the Merchant Generation segment, primarily because of items detailed below at Genco. 50 Table of Contents Genco Gencos effective tax rate was higher, after excluding the impact of the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge, primarily due to the increase in the Illinois statutory income tax rate in 2011, decreased Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions and lower benefits from state tax credits related to capital investments, offset by favorable changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2011, compared to unfavorable changes in 2010, and the decrease in the effective tax rate from the effect of the change in the tax treatment of retiree health care costs in 2010. 2010 versus 2009 Ameren Corporation Amerens effective tax rate was higher in 2010 than in 2009, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the goodwill impairment charge and the effect of the change in the tax treatment of retiree health care costs. Additional variations are discussed below. Variations in effective tax rates for Amerens business segments and for the Ameren Companies between 2010 and 2009 were as follows. Ameren Missouri Ameren Missouris effective tax rate was higher, primarily because of the change in tax treatment of retiree health care costs, along with the decreased impact of favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities and other permanent items on higher pretax book income. Ameren Illinois Regulated Segment The effective tax rate was higher, primarily because of the decreased impact of favorable net amortization of property related regulatory assets and liabilities and permanent items on higher pretax book income. Merchant Generation The effective tax rate was lower in the Merchant Generation segment, because of items detailed below at Genco, partially offset by the impact of state tax credits related to capital investments and decreased Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions on a pretax book loss. Genco The effective tax rate increased, after the impact of the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge was excluded, primarily because of the change in tax treatment of retiree health care costs and changes to reserves for uncertain tax positions mitigated by the increased impact of state tax credits, Internal Revenue Code Section 199 production activity deductions, and investment tax credit amortization on lower pretax book income. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Ameren Illinois On October 1, 2010, Ameren, CIPS, CILCO, IP, AERG and AER completed a two step corporate internal reorganization. The first step of the reorganization was the Ameren Illinois Merger. The second step of the reorganization involved the distribution of AERG stock from Ameren Illinois to Ameren and the subsequent contribution by Ameren of the AERG stock to AER. Ameren Illinois determined that the operating results of AERG qualified for discontinued operations presentation. We have therefore segregated AERGs operating results and presented them separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented prior to October 1, 2010, in this report. For Amerens financial statements, AERGs results of operation remain classified as continuing operations. See Note 16 Corporate Reorganization and Discontinued Operations under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Ameren Illinois income from discontinued operations (AERG) decreased $74 million in 2010, compared with 2009. AERGs results of operations were included in Ameren Illinois consolidated statement of income for all periods prior to October 1, 2010. The inclusion of only nine months in 2010 contributed to the decrease in income from discontinued operations as well as a decrease in electric margins caused by lower realized revenue per megawatt sold and higher fuel and related transportation costs. The decrease was partially offset by a reduction in income tax expense primarily caused by lower pretax book income. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The tariff based gross margins of Amerens rate regulated utility operating companies continue to be a principal source of cash from operating activities for Ameren and its rate regulated subsidiaries. A diversified retail customer mix of primarily rate regulated residential, commercial, and industrial classes and a commodity mix of natural gas and electric service provide a reasonably predictable source of cash flows for Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois. For operating cash flows, Genco, through Marketing Company, sells power through primarily market based contracts with wholesale and retail customers. In addition to using cash flows from operating activities, the Ameren Companies use available cash, credit facility borrowings, commercial paper issuances, money pool borrowings, or other short term borrowings from affiliates to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements. The Ameren Companies may reduce their credit facility or short term borrowings with cash from operations or, at their discretion, with long term borrowings or, in the case of Ameren subsidiaries, with equity infusions from Ameren. The Ameren Companies expect to incur significant capital expenditures over the next five years as they comply with environmental regulations and make significant investments in their electric and natural gas utility infrastructure to support overall system reliability and 51 Table of Contents other improvements. Ameren intends to finance those capital expenditures and investments with a blend of equity and debt so that it maintains a capital structure in its rate regulated businesses of approximately 50% to 55% equity, assuming constructive regulatory environments. Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois plan to implement their long term financing plans for debt, equity, or equity linked securities in order to finance their operations appropriately, meet scheduled debt maturities, and maintain financial strength and flexibility. Genco and the Merchant Generation segment seek to fund their operations internally and therefore seek not to rely on financing from Ameren or external, third party sources. Genco and the Merchant Generation segment will continue to seek to defer capital and operating expenses, sell certain assets, and take other actions as necessary to fund their operations internally while maintaining safe and reliable operations. Under its indenture, Genco may not borrow additional funds from external, third party sources if its interest coverage ratio is less than a specified minimum or its leverage ratio is greater than a specified maximum. See Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on Gencos indenture provisions. Based on projections as of December 31, 2011, of Gencos operating results and cash flows, we expect that, by the end of the first quarter of 2013, Gencos interest coverage ratio will be less than the minimum ratio required for the company to borrow additional funds from external, third party sources. Gencos indenture does not restrict intercompany borrowings from Amerens non state regulated subsidiary money pool. However, borrowings from the money pool are subject to Amerens control, and if a Genco intercompany financing need were to arise, borrowings from the non state regulated subsidiary money pool by Genco would be dependent on consideration by Ameren of the facts and circumstances existing at that time. The following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009: Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities Net Cash (Used In) Investing Activities Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Ameren(a) $ 1,878 $ 1,823 $ 1,967 $ (1,048 ) $ (1,096 ) $ (1,781 ) $ (1,120 ) $ (804 ) $ 344 Ameren Missouri 1,056 969 975 (627 ) (700 ) (957 ) (430 ) (334 ) 249 Ameren Illinois 504 593 845 (296 ) (247 ) (442 ) (509 ) (330 ) (147 ) Genco 215 304 253 (141 ) (29 ) (389 ) (72 ) (275 ) 139 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. Cash Flows from Operating Activities 2011 versus 2010 Ameren Corporation Amerens cash from operating activities increased in 2011, compared with 2010. The following items contributed to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2011, compared with 2010: Ameren Missouris regulatory asset for FAC under recovery decreased by $216 million as more deferred costs were recovered from customers during 2011. Trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues balances decreased, primarily because of milder weather in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Those same weather conditions caused accounts payable balances to MISO and natural gas suppliers to decrease as less power and natural gas was purchased. Additionally, during 2011, MISO shortened the length of its settlement terms for all of its members. The new terms resulted in an acceleration of payments that previously would not have been paid until 2012. These factors resulted in a net increase of $120 million in cash from operating activities in 2011 compared with 2010. A net $100 million decrease in collateral posted with counterparties due primarily to the items discussed at the registrant subsidiaries below, partially offset by a decrease in collateral returned from Ameren counterparties of $10 million and additional collateral posted to counterparties of $4 million due to changes in the market price of power. Deferred budget billing receivables decreased by $71 million, partially as a result of milder weather. A $45 million decrease in interest payments, primarily due to the long term debt redemptions at the registrant subsidiaries discussed below and a reduction in Amerens borrowings under its credit facility agreements, which resulted in an $11 million reduction in interest payments. An $11 million reduction in payments for scheduled nuclear refueling and maintenance outages at the Callaway energy center caused primarily by the timing of the 2011 outage compared with the 2010 outage, which had unpaid liabilities as of December 31, 2011. The following items reduced the increase in Amerens cash from operating activities during 2011, compared with 2010: A $115 million increase in pension and OPEB plan contributions. Ameren Illinois contributed to Amerens postretirement benefit VEBA trust an incremental $100 million in excess of Ameren Illinois annual postretirement net periodic cost for regulatory purposes. Electric and natural gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, decreased by $86 million, 52 Table of Contents excluding impacts of noncash MTM transactions. During 2010, Amerens Merchant Generation coal fired energy centers, significantly reduced their coal inventory levels, which resulted in an estimated $64 million cash savings in excess of the smaller inventory reduction that occurred in 2011. A $55 million decrease associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident, primarily as a result of insurance recoveries received in 2010, but not in 2011. A $34 million increase in major storm restoration costs. A $31 million decrease in income tax refunds. The 2010 refund resulted primarily from a 2009 change in tax treatment of electric generation plant expenditures while the 2011 refund resulted primarily from casualty loss deductions due to an Internal Revenue Service audit settlement. Ameren did not make any federal income tax payments in 2011 because of accelerated deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation, use of its net operating loss carryforwards, and other deductions. A $30 million increase in taxes other than income tax payments related to higher assessed property tax values for energy center enhancements, county property tax rate increases, the timing of property tax payments at each year end for Ameren Missouri. Ameren Illinois incurred an increase in electricity distribution and invested capital tax payments resulting from the tiered rate structure for the merged entity. Reduced collections as more utility customers were past due on their bills on December 31, 2011, than on December 31, 2010. Additionally, write offs of customer receivable balances increased because of economic conditions. An $18 million increase in Ameren Missouri receivables held in court registries under the appeals of the MoPSCs 2009 and 2010 rate orders. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. A $16 million decrease in Ameren Illinois electric purchased power commodity over recovered costs. A $15 million increase in energy efficiency expenditures for new customer programs. The Ameren Illinois amount is recovered through customer billings over time. An $11 million decrease in natural gas commodity over recovered costs under the PGA, primarily in Illinois. A $7 million increase in preliminary study expenditures, primarily at Ameren Missouri for environmental compliance testing. Ameren Missouri Ameren Missouris cash from operating activities increased in 2011 compared with 2010. The following items contributed to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2011, compared with 2010: The regulatory asset for FAC under recovery decreased by $216 million as more deferred costs were recovered from customers during 2011. Trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances decreased by $65 million, primarily because of milder weather in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Deferred budget billing receivables decreased by $33 million, partially as a result of milder weather. Electric and natural gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, increased by $25 million, excluding impacts of noncash MTM transactions. A $16 million decrease in payments associated with major outages at coal fired energy centers, primarily because the scope of the major outages in 2011 were not as extensive as the scope of the major outages performed in 2010. An $11 million reduction in payments due to the timing of scheduled nuclear refueling and maintenance outages at the Callaway energy center as discussed above. A $4 million decrease in interest payments, primarily due to the redemption of subordinated deferrable interest debentures in September 2010. The following items reduced the increase in Ameren Missouris cash from operating activities during 2011, compared with 2010: Income tax payments of $9 million in 2011, compared with income tax refunds of $106 million in 2010. The 2010 refund resulted primarily from a 2009 change in tax treatment of electric generation plant expenditures and accelerated deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation. Ameren Missouris 2011 tax liability was reduced by accelerated deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation, use of its net operating loss carryforwards, and other deductions. A $55 million decrease associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident, primarily as a result of insurance recoveries received in 2010, but not in 2011. A $23 million increase in property tax payments caused primarily by higher assessed tax values for energy center enhancements, county tax rate increases, and the timing of property tax payments at each year end. A $21 million increase in major storm restoration costs. An $18 million increase in receivables held in court registries under the appeals of the MoPSCs 2009 and 2010 rate orders. Reduced collections as more customers were past due on their bills on December 31, 2011, than on December 31, 2010. Additionally, write offs of customer receivable balances increased because of economic conditions. A net $6 million decrease in collateral returned from exchange counterparties and, to a lesser extent, additional collateral postings to MISO, all due to changes in the market price of power and natural gas. A $6 million increase in energy efficiency expenditures for new customer programs. A $6 million increase in preliminary study expenditures, primarily for environmental compliance testing. 53 Table of Contents Ameren Illinois Ameren Illinois cash from operating activities decreased in 2011 compared with 2010. Ameren Illinois cash from operating activities included AERGs operating cash flows for all periods prior to October 1, 2010, which were presented as discontinued operations in Ameren Illinois consolidated statement of cash flows. Excluding the impacts of discontinued operations, Ameren Illinois cash from operating activities decreased in 2011 compared with 2010. The following items contributed to the decrease in cash from operating activities associated with continuing operations during 2011, compared with 2010: A $103 million increase in pension and OPEB plan contributions. Ameren Illinois contributed to Amerens postretirement benefit VEBA trust an incremental $100 million in excess of Ameren Illinois annual postretirement net periodic cost for regulatory purposes. A $38 million decrease in income tax refunds caused primarily by a reduction in transmission and distribution repair deductions, partially offset by additional casualty loss deductions from an Internal Revenue Service audit settlement. Ameren Illinois did not make any federal income tax payments in 2011 because of accelerated deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation and other deductions. Electric and natural gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, decreased by $30 million, excluding impacts of noncash MTM transactions. A $16 million decrease in electric purchased power commodity over recovered costs. A $13 million increase in major storm restoration costs. Reduced collection results as more customers were past due on their bills on December 31, 2011, than on December 31, 2010. Additionally, write offs of customer receivable balances increased because of economic conditions. A $9 million increase in taxes other than income payments, due primarily to an increase in electricity distribution and invested capital tax payments resulting from the tiered rate structure for the merged entity. A $9 million decrease in natural gas commodity over recovered costs under the PGA. A $9 million increase in energy efficiency expenditures for new customer programs. These expenditures are recovered through customer billings over time. The following items reduced the decrease in Ameren Illinois cash from operating activities associated with continuing operations during 2011, compared with 2010: A net $120 million decrease in collateral posted with counterparties due, in part, to a reduction in the market price of natural gas and in contracted volumes. Trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues balances decreased, primarily because of milder weather in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Those same weather conditions caused accounts payable balances to MISO and natural gas suppliers to decrease as less power and natural gas was purchased. Additionally, during 2011, MISO shortened the length of its settlement terms for all of its members. The new terms resulted in an acceleration of payments that previously would not have been paid until 2012. These factors resulted in a net increase of $63 million in cash from operating activities in 2011 compared with 2010. Deferred budget billing balances decreased by $38 million, partially as a result of milder weather. An $11 million decrease in interest payments, primarily due to the redemption of first mortgage bonds in September 2010. Genco Gencos cash from operating activities decreased in 2011 compared with 2010. The following items contributed to the decrease in cash from operating activities during 2011, compared with 2010: Electric margins, as discussed in Result of Operations, decreased by $63 million, excluding impacts of noncash MTM transactions. During 2010, Genco significantly reduced the volume of its coal inventory, which resulted in an estimated $43 million cash savings in excess of the smaller inventory reduction that occurred in 2011. The January 2010 receipt from Marketing Company for December 2009 generation output was $16 million higher than the January 2011 receipt for December 2010 generation output. This was primarily caused by the inclusion of higher priced sales contracts from the 2006 Illinois power procurement auction, which expired in May 2010. A $9 million increase in payments associated with major outages at coal fired energy centers, primarily because the scope of the major outages in 2011 were more extensive than the scope of the major outages performed in 2010. An $8 million increase in pension plan contributions as EEI made a contribution in 2011, but made no contribution in 2010. The following items reduced the decrease in Gencos cash from operating activities during 2011, compared with 2010: Income tax refunds of $25 million in 2011, compared with income tax payments of $1 million in 2010. The 2011 refund was primarily due to an increase in accelerated depreciation deductions authorized by the economic stimulus legislation. Genco did not make any federal income tax payments in 2011 primarily because of accelerated deductions related to pollution control equipment, economic stimulus legislation and deductions related to the closure of Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers. A $20 million decrease in interest payments, primarily due to the redemption of senior notes in November 2010. 54 Table of Contents 2010 versus 2009 Amerens cash from operating activities decreased in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items contributed to the decrease in cash from operating activities during 2010, compared with 2009: A $116 million decrease in billed revenues, net of payments to suppliers, for pass through natural gas commodity costs primarily caused by higher priced natural gas injected into storage during 2008 and billed to customers in 2009. Accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances increased by $106 million, primarily because of higher utility rates and colder December weather in 2010, compared with December 2009. Deferred FAC costs increased $100 million as net base fuel costs incurred at Ameren Missouri exceeded the amounts allowed in base rates due to higher fuel costs and lower off system sales as a result of warmer weather increasing native load demand. Deferred budget billing balances increased by $74 million, partially as a result of warmer summer weather, which increased sales volumes over budget billed amounts. An overall $56 million increase in collateral posted with counterparties due, in part, to the items discussed at the subsidiaries below, offset by a $105 million reduction in collateral posted by nonregistrant subsidiaries, primarily due to changes in the market price of power. A $53 million decrease associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident, primarily as a result of reduced insurance recoveries. A $39 million increase in payments related to the Callaway energy center refueling and maintenance outage that occurred in 2010, but did not occur in 2009. A $14 million increase in payments associated with major outages at coal fired plants, primarily at Ameren Missouri. A $12 million increase in property tax payments caused primarily by higher assessed tax rates in Missouri. A $10 million one time donation in 2010 for customer assistance programs required by the 2009 Illinois energy legislation that authorized the bad debt rate adjustment mechanism used by Ameren Illinois. Payments for professional services, additional franchise taxes, and other administrative items necessary to complete the Ameren Illinois Merger and AERG distribution totaled $8 million. The following items reduced the decrease in Amerens cash from operating activities during 2010, compared with 2009: Electric and natural gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, increased by $212 million, excluding impacts of noncash MTM transactions. Income tax refunds of $92 million in 2010, compared with income tax payments of $9 million in 2009. The refund primarily resulted from an acceleration of depreciation deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation. Ameren reduced its coal inventory levels, primarily at the Merchant Generation segment, in 2010. The inventory reduction is estimated to have resulted in cash savings of $69 million in 2010. A $32 million decrease in major storm restoration costs. Contributions to the pension and postretirement plans were $31 million lower in 2010. A $14 million reduction in severance payments as a result of the voluntary and involuntary separation programs initiated in both years. Ameren Missouri Ameren Missouris cash from operating activities decreased in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items contributed to the decrease in cash from operating activities during 2010, compared with 2009: A $102 million decrease in income tax refunds, primarily due to higher pretax book income and a reduction in 2010 of the benefit of a change in tax treatment of electric generation plant expenditures taken in 2009. Deferred FAC costs increased $100 million as net base fuel costs incurred exceeded the amounts allowed in base rates due to higher fuel costs and lower off system sales as a result of warmer weather increasing native load demand. A $53 million decrease associated with the December 2005 Taum Sauk incident discussed above. A $39 million increase in payments related to a Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage that occurred in 2010, but did not occur in 2009. A $24 million increase in payments associated with major outages at coal fired plants. A $12 million increase in property tax payments, caused primarily by higher assessed tax rates. An $11 million increase in energy efficiency expenditures for new customer programs.

A $31 million reduction in collateral posted with counterparties due in part to improved credit ratings and to changes in the market price of power and natural gas. A $13 million decrease in major storm restoration costs. Contributions to the pension and postretirement plans were $8 million lower in 2010. A $5 million reduction in severance payments as a result of the voluntary and involuntary separation programs initiated in both years. 55 Table of Contents Ameren Illinois Ameren Illinois cash from operating activities decreased in 2010 compared with 2009. Ameren Illinois cash from operating activities included AERGs operating cash flows for all periods prior to October 1, 2010, which were presented as discontinued operations in Ameren Illinois consolidated statement of cash flows. Excluding the impacts of discontinued operations, Ameren Illinois cash from operating activities decreased in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items contributed to the decrease in cash from operating activities associated with continuing operations during 2010, compared with 2009: A $192 million increase in collateral posted with counterparties due, in part, to changes in the market price of natural gas and collateral posting requirements. Accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances increased by $183 million, primarily because of higher utility rates and colder December weather in 2010, compared with December 2009. A $98 million decrease in billed revenues, net of payments to suppliers, for pass through natural gas commodity costs primarily caused by higher priced natural gas injected into storage during 2008 and billed to customers in 2009. Deferred budget billing balances increased by $60 million, partially as a result of warmer summer weather, which increased sales volumes over budget billed amounts. A $10 million one time donation in 2010 for customer assistance programs required by the 2009 Illinois legislation that authorized the bad debt rate adjustment mechanism. Payments for professional services, additional franchise taxes, and other administrative items necessary to complete the Ameren Illinois Merger and AERG distribution, which totaled $7 million. In 2009, Ameren Illinois received $5 million from Marketing Company for the costs of upgrades to Ameren Illinois electric transmission system. There was no such receipt in 2010. The following items reduced the decrease in Ameren Illinois cash from operating activities associated with continuing operations during 2010, compared with 2009: Electric and natural gas margins, as discussed in Results of Operations, increased by $187 million, excluding the noncash impacts of MTM transactions. Income tax refunds of $52 million in 2010, compared with income tax payments of $61 million in 2009. The refund resulted primarily from an acceleration of depreciation deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation. A $19 million decrease in major storm restoration costs. Contributions to the pension and postretirement plans were $11 million lower in 2010. A $6 million decrease in interest payments, primarily because of the first mortgage bond maturity in June 2009. Ameren Illinois cash from operating activities associated with discontinued operations decreased in 2010 compared with 2009. AERGs cash flows were included in Ameren Illinois consolidated statement of cash flows for all periods prior to October 1, 2010. The inclusion of only nine months in 2010 was the primary cause of the decrease in cash flows, along with a reduction in receipts from Marketing Company under the AERG PSA, primarily due to lower market prices. A decrease in income tax payments, primarily due to lower pretax book income, and an acceleration of depreciation deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation partially offset the decrease in AERGs operating cash flows. Genco Gencos cash from operating activities increased in 2010 compared with 2009. The following items contributed to the increase in cash from operating activities during 2010, compared with 2009: A $73 million decrease in income tax payments, primarily due to lower pretax book income, deductions relating to environmental expenditures, and an acceleration of depreciation deductions authorized by economic stimulus legislation. Reduced coal inventory levels in 2010, which are estimated to have resulted in cash savings of $50 million in 2010. Lower labor expenditures resulting from staff reductions and fewer major outages at its coal fired plants. A $7 million reduction in use tax payments as Genco and EEI began claiming tax exemptions and credits for purchase transactions related to their generation operations. Contributions to the pension plans were $6 million lower in 2010. The following items reduced the increase in Gencos cash from operating activities during 2010, compared with 2009: Electric margins, as discussed in Result of Operations, decreased by $99 million, excluding impacts of noncash MTM transactions. A $13 million increase in interest payments, primarily due to the senior unsecured notes issued in November 2009, which required interest payments in 2010, but not in 2009. Pension Funding Amerens pension plans are funded in compliance with income tax regulations and to meet federal funding or regulatory requirements. As a result, Ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the greater of the pension expense or the legally required minimum contribution. Considering Amerens assumptions at December 31, 2011, its investment performance in 2011, and its pension funding policy, Ameren expects to make annual contributions of $90 million to $150 million in each of the next five years, with aggregate estimated contributions of $580 million. We expect Ameren 56 Table of Contents Missouris, Ameren Illinois, and Gencos portion of the future funding requirements to be 51%, 33% and 12%, respectively. These amounts are estimates. The estimates may change with actual investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in our assumptions, any pertinent changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions. In 2011, Ameren contributed $103 million to its pension plans. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2011 versus 2010 Amerens cash used in investing activities decreased by $48 million during 2011, compared with 2010. In 2011, cash flows from investing activities benefited from an increase of proceeds from property sales as well as $8 million in proceeds from the sale of its investment in a leveraged lease and a $9 million payment received from the DOE under the terms of Ameren Missouris settlement with the DOE in 2011 related to nuclear waste disposal. Net cash used for capital expenditures decreased $12 million during 2011, compared with 2010. Reductions in capital expenditures caused by the completion of two energy center scrubber projects in 2010 were offset, in part, by an increase in storm related repair costs, an increase in electric transmission investments, and expenditures for a third energy center scrubber project in 2011. Ameren Missouris cash used in investing activities decreased by $73 million during 2011, compared with 2010, principally because of a $74 million decrease in capital expenditures and a $9 million payment received from the DOE in 2011 under the terms of the settlement with the DOE related to nuclear waste disposal. These cash benefits were reduced by a $6 million net decrease in nuclear decommissioning trust fund activities. Capital expenditures were lower in 2011 as a result of the completion in 2010 of two scrubbers at Ameren Missouris Sioux energy center and boiler projects, which offset a $28 million increase in capital expenditures related to storm related repair costs. Ameren Illinois cash used in investing activities increased by $49 million during 2011, compared with 2010. There was a $70 million increase in capital expenditures primarily as a result of increased investment in electric transmission assets and a $17 million increase in capital expenditures related to storm related repair costs. In 2011, cash flows from investing activities benefited from the repayments of advances previously paid to ATXI, as a result of the completion of a project under a joint ownership agreement. In 2010, cash flows from investing activities benefited from the proceeds received on an intercompany note receivable, offset, in part, by advances to ATXI. Gencos cash used in investing activities increased by $112 million during 2011, compared with 2010. Net cash used for capital expenditures increased by $46 million primarily as a result of increased spending for energy center scrubber projects and boiler projects. The Coffeen energy center scrubber project was completed in February 2010, and construction began in April 2011 on Gencos Newton energy center scrubber project. In 2011, cash flows from investing activities benefited from the proceeds of property sales, principally attributed to $45 million of proceeds received from the sale of Gencos remaining interest in its Columbia CT facility. In 2010, cash flows from investing activities benefited from the proceeds received from the sale of 25% of Gencos Columbia CT facility. During 2011, cash provided by sales of properties enabled Genco to contribute net non state regulated subsidiaries money pool advances of $49 million. During 2010, Genco received $48 million in net repayment of non state regulated subsidiaries money pool advances. 2010 versus 2009 Amerens cash used in investing activities decreased by $685 million during 2010, compared with 2009. There was a $668 million decrease in capital expenditures as compared with 2009 as a result of reductions in planned capital expenditures for the distribution system and energy center improvements during 2010, a $109 million reduction in capital expenditures to repair severe storm damage, and the completion of energy center scrubber projects in the Merchant Generation segment during 2009 and early 2010. Cash flows from investing activities in 2010 also benefited from the sale of 25% of Gencos Columbia CT facility and other properties. Ameren Missouris cash used in investing activities decreased by $257 million during 2010, compared with 2009. There was a $258 million decrease in capital expenditures as compared with 2009 as a result of reductions in planned capital expenditures for the distribution system and energy center improvements during 2010, as well as a $74 million reduction in capital expenditures to repair severe storm damage. This cash benefit was reduced by a $12 million net decrease in nuclear decommissioning trust fund activities. Ameren Illinois cash used in investing activities decreased by $195 million during 2010, compared with 2009. There was a $71 million decrease in capital expenditures compared with 2009 because Ameren Illinois reduced planned capital expenditures for the distribution system during 2010 after receiving significantly less than it requested in a rate proceeding, as well as a $35 million reduction in capital expenditures to repair severe storm damage. Similar planned capital expenditure reductions at AERG resulted in the $85 million decrease in capital expenditures of discontinued operations. Additionally, Ameren Illinois advances to ATXI for construction under a joint ownership agreement decreased during 2010 as the project approached completion. Ameren Illinois received funding for this construction under a generator interconnection agreement related to ongoing transmission upgrade projects. Gencos cash used in investing activities decreased by $360 million during 2010, compared with 2009. Reductions in planned capital expenditures, as well as completion of energy center scrubber projects during 2009, resulted in a $221 million decrease in capital expenditures compared with 2009. Cash flows from investing activities in 2010 also 57 Table of Contents benefited from the $18 million of proceeds Genco received from the sale of 25% of its Columbia CT facility and net repayment of non state regulated subsidiaries money pool advances. Capital Expenditures The following table presents the capital expenditures by the Ameren Companies for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009: Capital Expenditures 2011 2010 2009 Ameren(a) $ 1,030 $ 1,042 $ 1,710 Ameren Missouri 550 624 882 Ameren Illinois 351 281 352 Merchant Generation Genco 141 95 316 Merchant Generation Other 12 6 92 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and the elimination of intercompany transfers. Amerens 2011 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. Ameren Missouri spent $24 million on building its Maryland Heights energy center and $31 million for storm related repair costs. Ameren Illinois incurred storm related repair costs of $20 million. Genco spent $75 million toward scrubbers at its Newton and Coffeen energy centers for compliance with environmental regulations. Other capital expenditures were made principally to maintain, upgrade, and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, as well as to fund various energy center upgrades. Amerens 2010 capital expenditures principally consisted of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. Ameren Missouri spent $130 million toward two scrubbers at its Sioux energy center, which were completed in 2010. At Genco, there was a cash outlay of $29 million for energy center scrubber projects. The scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental regulations. Other capital expenditures were made principally to maintain, upgrade, and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, as well as to fund various energy center upgrades. Amerens 2009 capital expenditures consisted principally of the following expenditures at its subsidiaries. Ameren Missouri spent $173 million toward two scrubbers at its Sioux energy center, $93 million toward the Taum Sauk rebuild, and it incurred storm related expenditures of $78 million. Ameren Illinois incurred storm related repair costs of $38 million. At Genco, there was a cash outlay of $169 million for energy center scrubber projects. The scrubbers are necessary to comply with environmental regulations. Other capital expenditures were made principally to maintain, upgrade, and expand the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois as well as various energy center upgrades. The following table estimates the capital expenditures that will be incurred by the Ameren Companies from 2012 through 2016, including construction expenditures, capitalized interest for the Merchant Generation business, allowance for funds used during construction for our rate regulated utility businesses, and estimated expenditures for compliance with known and existing environmental regulations. As a result of a sharp decline in forward power prices in early 2012, as well as uncertain environmental regulations, Genco is decelerating the construction of two scrubbers at its Newton energy center, and AERG has removed the previously planned precipitator upgrades at its E.D. Edwards energy center from the five year capital expenditures forecast. Genco will continue to incur some ongoing capital costs related to the construction of the Newton scrubbers. The table below includes Gencos estimated capital expenditures of approximately $150 million in 2012 and approximately $20 million annually from 2013 through 2016 for the installation of the two scrubbers, excluding capitalized interest. See Outlook and also Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of the impact of declining power prices on the Merchant Generation segment. 2012 2013 2016 Total Ameren Missouri $ 665 $ 2,190 $ 2,960 $ 2,855 $ 3,625 Ameren Illinois 535 2,020 2,730 2,555 3,265 Merchant Generation Genco 175 165 220 340 395 Merchant Generation Other 5 35 50 40 55 ATX/ATXI 25 625 845 650 870 Other(a) (10 ) 45 65 35 55 Ameren $ 1,395 $ 5,080 $ 6,870 $ 6,475 $ 8,265 (a) Includes the eliminations of intercompany transfers. Ameren Missouris estimated capital expenditures include transmission, distribution, and generation related investments, as well as expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations discussed below. Ameren Illinois estimated capital expenditures are primarily for electric and natural gas transmission and distribution related investments, and expected capital expenditures incremental to historical average electric delivery capital expenditures to modernize its distribution system pursuant to the IEIMA. For additional information on the IEIMA, see Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Gencos estimated capital expenditures are primarily for compliance with environmental regulations and upgrades to existing coal and natural gas fired energy centers discussed below. Estimated capital expenditures of Ameren nonregistrant subsidiaries consist primarily of AERGs estimated expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations discussed below and ATX/ATXIs estimated transmission expenditures. We continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs. As a result, we could modify our plan for generation capacity, which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and whether capacity or power may 58 Table of Contents be purchased, among other things. Additionally, we continually review the reliability of our transmission and distribution systems, expected capacity needs, and opportunities for transmission investments. The timing and amount of investment could vary due to changes in expected capacity, the condition of transmission and distribution systems, and the ability and willingness to pursue transmission investments, among other things. Any changes that we may plan to make for future generation, transmission or distribution needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred, which could be material. Environmental Capital Expenditures Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco will incur significant costs in future years to comply with existing and known federal and state regulations regarding SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of existing environmental laws and regulations that affect, or may affect, our facilities and capital costs to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our assessment of the potential impacts of the EPAs proposed regulation of CCR and cooling water intake structures, the MATS, the stayed CSAPR, and the revised national ambient air quality standards for SO2 and NOx emissions as of December 31, 2011. Cash Flows from Financing Activities 2011 versus 2010 During 2011, we reduced our reliance on borrowings from short term debt and credit facilities, and we reduced long term debt outstanding while maintaining adequate cash balances for working capital needs. Amerens cash used in financing activities increased in 2011, compared with 2010. During 2011, Amerens cash flow from operating activities of $1.9 billion exceeded its capital expenditures of $1.0 billion and common stock dividend requirements of $375 million. Ameren used this cash as well as cash on hand to repay $581 million of short term debt and credit facility borrowings, to redeem $155 million of long term debt, and to repay $73 million of advances previously received from generators due to project completion. During 2010, Ameren redeemed $310 million of long term debt and $52 million of preferred stock. Ameren Missouris cash used in financing activities increased by $96 million in 2011, compared with 2010. During 2011, Ameren Missouris cash flow from operating activities of $1.1 billion exceeded its combined capital and nuclear fuel expenditures of $612 million. Ameren Missouri utilized this cash to pay common stock dividends of $403 million and repay $19 million of advances previously received from generators due to project completion. During 2010, Ameren Missouri paid common stock dividends of $235 million; redeemed $70 million of long term debt, including its 7.69% Series A subordinated debentures; and redeemed all outstanding shares of its $7.64 Series preferred stock. Ameren Illinois net cash used in financing activities increased by $179 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Ameren Illinois common stock dividend increased $194 million compared with 2010. In June 2011, Ameren Illinois 6.625% $150 million senior secured notes matured and were repaid and retired using available cash on hand. During 2010, in connection with the Ameren Illinois Merger, Ameren Illinois (formerly CILCO) redeemed all of its preferred stock and all $40 million of its 7.61% Series 1997 2 first mortgage bonds (formerly CIPS). Net repayments of generator advances received for construction increased $25 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Gencos net cash used in financing activities decreased by $203 million in 2011 compared with 2010. During 2011, Gencos cash flow from operating activities of $215 million exceeded its capital expenditures of $141 million. Additionally, Genco received a capital contribution from Ameren associated with a tax allocation agreement that benefited 2011 cash flows from financing activities. Genco used this cash to reduce its reliance on credit facility borrowings. In 2010, Genco repaid at maturity $200 million of its 8.35% senior notes at maturity and repaid a net $176 million of intercompany note borrowings. These 2010 cash outlays were offset, in part, by credit facility borrowings. 2010 versus 2009 During 2010, we replaced and extended the expiration of our credit facilities. We sought to reduce our reliance on borrowings from our credit facilities and to reduce long term debt outstanding while maintaining adequate cash balances for working capital needs. Ameren had an $804 million net use of cash from financing activities in 2010, compared with a $344 million net source of cash in 2009. During 2010, Amerens cash flow from operating activities of $1.8 billion exceeded its capital expenditures of $1.0 billion and common stock dividend requirements of $368 million. Ameren used this cash to redeem $310 million of long term debt and $52 million of preferred stock in 2010. During 2009, Ameren issued $1 billion of senior debt and $634 million in common stock. It used the proceeds to repurchase, redeem, and fund maturities of $631 million of long term debt, to reduce short term borrowings, and to fund capital expenditures and other working capital needs at Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and Genco. Ameren Missouri had a $334 million net use of cash from financing activities in 2010, compared with a $249 million net source of cash in 2009. Planned reductions of expenditures allowed Ameren Missouri to use cash from operations and credit facility borrowings to fund its capital expenditures and working capital needs without issuing additional senior debt or capital contributions from 59 Table of Contents Ameren. Additionally, during 2010, these efforts allowed Ameren Missouri to redeem $70 million of long term debt, including its 7.69% Series A subordinated debentures; to redeem all outstanding shares of its $7.64 Series preferred stock; to increase common stock dividends by $60 million; and to reduce short term and intercompany borrowing repayments by $343 million, compared with 2009. Ameren Illinois net cash used in financing activities increased by $183 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Reduction of planned expenditures allowed it to use cash from operations to fund its capital expenditures and working capital needs without the issuance of additional senior debt or capital contributions from Ameren. Additionally, Ameren Illinois common stock dividends increased $35 million compared with 2009, and CILCO redeemed all of its preferred stock in connection with the Ameren Illinois Merger. During 2009, Ameren made capital contributions to Ameren Illinois of $272 million and Ameren Illinois repaid $250 million of long term debt and $62 million of short term borrowing balances. Genco had a $275 million net use of cash from financing activities in 2010, compared with a $139 million net source of cash in 2009, primarily as a result of reductions of planned expenditures. These efforts allowed Genco to use cash from operations and credit facility borrowings to fund capital expenditures, to meet working capital needs, to repay its $200 million of 8.35% senior notes at maturity, and to repay a net $176 million of intercompany note borrowings in 2010. During 2009, Genco issued $249 million of long term debt and used the proceeds to repay short term borrowings and to fund general corporate purposes. Credit Facility Borrowings and Liquidity The liquidity needs of the Ameren Companies are typically supported through the use of available cash, short term intercompany borrowings, drawings under committed bank credit facilities, or commercial paper issuances. See Note 4 Short Term Debt and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on credit facilities, short term borrowing activity, commercial paper activity, relevant interest rates, and borrowings under Amerens utility and non state regulated subsidiary money pool arrangements. 60 Table of Contents The following table presents the committed 2010 Credit Agreements of Ameren and the Ameren Companies, and the credit capacity available under such agreements, considering reductions for commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit, as of December 31, 2011: Expiration Borrowing Capacity Credit Available Ameren and Ameren Missouri: 2010 Missouri Credit Agreement(a) September 2013 $ 800 $ 800 Ameren and Genco: 2010 Genco Credit Agreement(a) September 2013 500 500 Ameren and Ameren Illinois: 2010 Illinois Credit Agreement(a) September 2013 800 800 Ameren: Less: Commercial paper outstanding (148 ) Letters of credit (15 ) Total $ 2,100 $ 1,937 (a) The Ameren Companies may access these credit facilities through intercompany borrowing arrangements. In February 2011, Ameren Illinois received approval from the ICC to extend the expiration of its borrowing sublimit under the 2010 Illinois Credit Agreement to September 10, 2013. In June 2011, Ameren Missouri received approval from the MoPSC to extend the expiration of its borrowing sublimit under the 2010 Missouri Credit Agreement to September 10, 2013. The 2010 Credit Agreements are used to make cash borrowings, to issue letters of credit, and to support borrowings under Amerens $500 million commercial paper program, Ameren Missouris $500 million commercial paper program, and Ameren Illinois $500 million commercial paper program, the latter of which was created in October 2011. Any of the 2010 Credit Agreements are available to Ameren to support borrowings under Amerens commercial paper program, subject to borrowing sublimits. The 2010 Missouri Credit Agreement is available to support borrowings under Ameren Missouris commercial paper program, and the 2010 Illinois Credit Agreement is available to support borrowings under Ameren Illinois commercial paper program. The maximum aggregate amount available to each borrower under each facility is shown in the following table (such amount being such borrowers Borrowing Sublimit): 2010MissouriCreditAgreement 2010GencoCreditAgreement 2010 IllinoisCreditAgreement Ameren $ 500 $ 500 $ 300 Ameren Missouri 500 (a ) (a ) Ameren Illinois (a ) (a ) 800 Genco (a ) 500 (a ) (a) Not applicable. These credit agreements were also available for use, subject to applicable regulatory short term borrowing authorizations, by EEI or by other Ameren non state regulated subsidiaries through direct short term borrowings from Ameren and by most of Amerens non rate regulated subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Ameren Services, AER, AERG and Marketing Company, through a non state regulated subsidiary money pool agreement. Ameren has money pool agreements with and among its subsidiaries to coordinate and to provide for certain short term cash and working capital requirements. Separate money pools are maintained for utility and non state regulated entities. In addition, a unilateral borrowing agreement among Ameren, Ameren Illinois, and Ameren Services enables Ameren Illinois to make short term borrowings directly from Ameren. Pursuant to the terms of the unilateral borrowing agreement, the aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any time by Ameren Illinois under the unilateral borrowing agreement and the utility money pool agreement, together with any outstanding Ameren Illinois external credit facility borrowings or commercial paper issuances, may not exceed $500 million, pursuant to authorization from the ICC. Ameren Illinois did not borrow under the unilateral borrowing agreement during 2011 or 2010. Ameren Services is responsible for operation and administration of the money pool agreements. See Note 4 Short Term Debt and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of the money pool arrangements and the unilateral borrowing agreement. The issuance of short term debt securities by Amerens utility subsidiaries is subject to approval by FERC under the Federal Power Act. In March 2010, FERC issued an order authorizing the issuance of up to $1 billion of short term debt securities for Ameren Missouri. The authorization was effective as of April 1, 2010, and terminates on March 31, 2012. On October 1, 2010, FERC authorized Ameren Illinois to issue up to $1 billion of short term debt securities. The authorization became effective immediately and terminates on September 30, 2012. Genco has unlimited long and short term debt issuance authorization from FERC. EEI has unlimited short term debt authorization from FERC. The issuance of short term debt securities by Ameren is not subject to approval by any regulatory body. The Ameren Companies continually evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of their liquidity arrangements given changing business conditions. When business conditions warrant, changes may be made to existing credit facilities or to other short term borrowing arrangements. 61 Table of Contents Long term Debt and Equity The following table presents the issuances of common stock and the issuances, redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long term debt and preferred stock (net of any issuance discounts and including any redemption premiums) for the years 2011, 2010, and 2009 for the Ameren Companies. For additional information related to the terms and uses of these issuances and the sources of funds and terms for the redemptions, see Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

IP cancelled these preferred shares. 62 Table of Contents A Form S 3 registration statement filed by Ameren with the SEC in June 2011 authorized the offering of 6 million additional shares of its common stock under DRPlus. Shares of common stock sold under DRPlus are, at Amerens option, newly issued shares, treasury shares, or shares purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In 2012, Ameren plans for shares to be purchased in the open market for DRPlus and its 401(k) plan. Under DRPlus and its 401(k) plan, Ameren issued 2.2 million, 3.0 million, and 3.2 million shares of common stock in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, which were valued at $65 million, $80 million, and $82 million for the respective years. In September 2009, Ameren issued and sold 21.85 million shares of its common stock at $25.25 per share, for proceeds of $535 million, net of $17 million of issuance costs. Ameren used the offering proceeds to make investments in its rate regulated utility subsidiaries in the form of capital contributions to Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois of $436 million and $99 million, respectively. The Ameren Companies may sell securities registered under their effective registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant such sales. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus that meets the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants See Note 4 Short Term Debt and Liquidity and Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions (and applicable cross default provisions) contained in our bank credit and term loan agreements and in certain of the Ameren Companies indentures and articles of incorporation. At December 31, 2011, the Ameren Companies were in compliance with the provisions and covenants contained within their credit agreements, indentures, and articles of incorporation provisions and covenants. We consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows. Inability to raise capital on reasonable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses. After assessing our current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), we believe that Ameren and its rate regulated businesses will continue to have access to the capital markets. However, events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets or make access to the capital markets uncertain or limited. Such events could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. Gencos operating results and operating cash flows are significantly affected by changes in market prices for power, which have significantly decreased over the past few years. Under the provisions of Gencos indenture described in Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings, in Part II, Item 8 of this report, Genco may not borrow additional funds from external, third party sources if its interest coverage ratio is less than a specified minimum or its leverage ratio is greater than a specified maximum. Based on projections as of December 31, 2011, of Gencos operating results and cash flows, we expect that, by the end of the first quarter of 2013, Gencos interest coverage ratio will be less than the minimum ratio required for the company to borrow additional funds from external, third party sources. Dividends Ameren paid to its shareholders common stock dividends totaling $375 million, or $1.555 per share, in 2011, $368 million, or $1.54 per share, in 2010, and $338 million, or $1.54 per share, in 2009. The payout rate based on net income in 2011 and 2009 was 72% and 55%, respectively. The payout of common stock dividends exceeded net income in 2010 because of the noncash goodwill, impairment and other charges recorded during 2010. Dividends paid to common shareholders in relation to net cash provided by operating activities for the same periods were 20% in 2011, 20% in 2010, and 17% in 2009. The amount and timing of dividends payable on Amerens common stock are within the sole discretion of Amerens board of directors. The board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends. However, as it has done in the past, the board of directors is expected to consider various issues, including Amerens overall payout ratio, payout ratios of our peers, projected cash flow and potential future cash flow requirements, historical earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, impacts of regulatory orders or legislation, and other key business considerations. On February 10, 2012, the board of directors of Ameren declared a quarterly dividend on Amerens common stock of 40 cents per share, payable on March 30, 2012, to stockholders of record on March 14, 2012. Certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the Ameren Companies payment of dividends in certain circumstances. Ameren Illinois articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Gencos indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making dividend payments on its common stock. Specifically, Genco cannot pay dividends on its common stock unless the companys actual interest coverage ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters and the 63 Table of Contents interest coverage ratios projected by management for each of the subsequent four six month periods are greater than a specified minimum level. Based on projections as of December 31, 2011, of Gencos operating results and cash flows in 2012 and 2013, we did not believe that Genco will achieve the minimum interest coverage ratio necessary to pay dividends on its common stock for the six months ended June 30, 2013, or the six months ended December 31, 2013. As a result, Genco was restricted from paying dividends on its common stock as of December 31, 2011, and we expect Genco will be unable to pay dividends on its common stock in 2012, 2013, and 2014. See Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on Gencos indenture provisions. Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and Genco as well as certain other nonregistrant Ameren subsidiaries are subject to Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for any officer or director of a public utility, as defined in the Federal Power Act, to participate in the making or paying of any dividend from any funds properly included in capital account. The meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the Federal Power Act or FERC regulations. However, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, (2) the dividends are not excessive, and (3) there is no self dealing on the part of corporate officials. At a minimum, Ameren believes that dividends can be paid by its subsidiaries that are public utilities from net income and retained earnings. In addition, under Illinois law, Ameren Illinois may not pay any dividend on its stock unless, among other things, its earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves, or unless Ameren Illinois has specific authorization from the ICC. In its application for the FERC orders approving the Ameren Illinois Merger and the AERG distribution, Ameren committed itself to maintain a minimum of 30% equity in its capital structure at Ameren Illinois following the Ameren Illinois Merger and the AERG distribution. At December 31, 2011, Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois were not restricted from paying dividends. The following table presents common stock dividends paid by Ameren Corporation to its common stockholders and by Amerens registrant subsidiaries to their respective parents. 2011 2010 2009 Ameren Missouri $ 403 $ 235 $ 175 Ameren Illinois 327 133 98 Genco 43 Dividends paid by Ameren 375 368 338 Certain of the Ameren Companies have issued preferred stock, which provides for cumulative preferred stock dividends. Each companys board of directors considers the declaration of the preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which the dividend is payable and the amount to be paid. See Note 5 Long term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred stock issuances. 64 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding expected minimum funding levels for our pension plans. These expected pension funding amounts are not included in the table below. In addition, routine short term purchase order commitments are not included.

(c) Excludes unamortized discount and premium of $15 million at Ameren, $5 million at Ameren Missouri, $8 million at Ameren Illinois, and $1 million at Genco. (d) The weighted average variable rate debt has been calculated using the interest rate as of December 31, 2011. (e) Amounts related to certain real estate leases and railroad licenses have indefinite payment periods. Amerens $2 million annual obligation for these items is included in the Less than 1 Year, 1 3 Years, and 3 5 Years columns. The amounts for the indefinite payments are not included in the After 5 Years column because that period is indefinite. (f) See Other Obligations within Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8 of this report, for discussion of items included herein. As of December 31, 2011, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits under the authoritative accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions were $148 million, $124 million, $11 million, and $9 million for Ameren, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and Genco, respectively. It is reasonably possible to expect that the settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit will result in an underpayment or overpayment of tax and related interest. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the timing of cash payments or receipts associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The amount and timing of certain payments or receipts is not reliably estimable or determinable at this time. See Note 13 Income Taxes under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding the Ameren Companies unrecognized tax benefits and related liabilities for interest expense. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2011, none of the Ameren Companies had off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business. None of the Ameren Companies expect to engage in any significant off balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future. 65 Table of Contents Credit Ratings The credit ratings of the Ameren Companies affect our liquidity, our access to the capital markets and credit markets, our cost of borrowing under our credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts. The following table presents the principal credit ratings of the Ameren Companies by Moodys, S&P, and Fitch effective on the date of this report: Moodys S&P Fitch Ameren: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa3 BBB BBB Senior unsecured debt Baa3 BB+ BBB Commercial paper P 3 A 3 F2 Ameren Missouri: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa2 BBB BBB+ Secured debt A3 BBB+ A Ameren Illinois: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa3 BBB BBB Secured debt Baa1 BBB/BBB+(a) BBB+ Senior unsecured debt Baa3 BBB BBB Genco: Issuer/corporate credit rating BB BB Senior unsecured debt Ba1 BB BB (a) The BBB+ rating applies to issuances of securities secured by the mortgage associated with the former property of CILCO. The BBB rating applies to issuances of securities secured by the mortgage associated with the former property of IP and CIPS. The cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can also increase or decrease depending upon the credit ratings of the borrower. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. It should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Collateral Postings Any adverse change in the Ameren Companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. Such changes may also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel, power, and natural gas supply, among other things, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. Cash collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties, including postings related to exchange traded contracts at December 31, 2011, were $145 million, $11 million, $102 million and $1 million at Ameren, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and Genco, respectively. The amount of cash collateral external counterparties posted with Ameren was $6 million at December 31, 2011. Sub investment grade issuer or senior unsecured debt ratings (lower than BBB or Baa3) at December 31, 2011, could have resulted in Ameren, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois or Genco being required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to $332 million, $86 million, $125 million, and $58 million, respectively. Changes in commodity prices could trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments at current credit ratings. If market prices were 15% higher than December 31, 2011, levels in the next 12 months and 20% higher thereafter through the end of the term of the commodity contracts, then Ameren, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and Genco could be required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations up to $119 million, $10 million, $ million, and $19 million, respectively. If market prices were 15% lower than December 31, 2011, levels in the next 12 months and 20% lower thereafter through the end of the term of the commodity contracts, then Ameren, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and Genco could be required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations up to $227 million, $10 million, $69 million, and $81 million, respectively. OUTLOOK Ameren seeks to earn competitive returns on its investments in its businesses. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are seeking to improve their regulatory frameworks and cost recovery mechanisms. At the same time, Amerens rate regulated businesses are pursuing constructive regulatory outcomes within existing frameworks and are seeking to align their overall spending, both operating and capital, with economic conditions and cash flows provided by their regulators. Consequently, Amerens rate regulated businesses expect to narrow the historic gap between allowed and earned returns on equity. Amerens Merchant Generation segment maintains a fleet of competitive coal fired and natural gas generating assets. Amerens merchant generation strategy is to position itself as a low cost provider and to benefit from an expected future recovery of power prices. Ameren intends to allocate its capital resources to those business opportunities, including electric and natural gas transmission, that offer the most attractive risk adjusted return potential. Below are some key trends, events, and uncertainties that are reasonably likely to affect the Ameren Companies financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity as well as their ability to achieve strategic and financial objectives for 2012 and beyond. Rate Regulated Operations Amerens strategy for earning competitive returns on its rate regulated investments involves meeting customer energy needs in an efficient fashion, working to enhance regulatory frameworks, making timely and well supported rate filings, and aligning overall spending with those rate case outcomes, economic conditions and return opportunities. The IEIMA, enacted late in 2011, provides for a performance based formula ratemaking framework for electric delivery utilities in Illinois. On January 3, 2012, Ameren Illinois elected to participate in this regulatory framework by making its initial performance based formula rate filing with the ICC. We believe that our 66 Table of Contents participation in this framework will better enable Ameren Illinois to earn its allowed return on equity for its electric delivery service business. This is expected to give Ameren Illinois the earnings predictability to invest in modernizing its distribution system. During 2012, Ameren Illinois is required to make a one time $7.5 million nonrecoverable donation to the Illinois Science and Energy Innovation Trust. Additionally, Ameren Illinois is required to make an annual donation to that same trust and to fund customer assistance programs, both of which will total approximately $2 million, in the aggregate, in 2012. As they continue to experience cost recovery pressures, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois expect to regularly seek electric and natural gas rate increases and timely cost recovery and tracking mechanisms from their regulators. These pressures include lower load growth from a weak economy, customer conservation efforts, and the impacts of energy efficiency programs, increased investments and expected future investments for environmental compliance, system reliability improvements, and new baseload capacity, including renewable requirements. Increased investments also result in higher depreciation and financing costs. Increased costs are also expected from rising employee benefit costs, higher property and income taxes, and higher insurance premiums as a result of insurance market conditions and loss experience, among other things. Following recommendations from the NRCs task force on lessons learned from the 2011 reactor accident in Japan, the NRC is expected to issue orders in 2012 requiring United States nuclear plants to enhance nuclear plant readiness to safely manage severe events. Such orders are expected to result in increased costs or investments. Amerens rate regulated businesses have procured rate increases. In January 2012, the ICC issued an order that authorized a $32 million increase in Ameren Illinois annual natural gas delivery service revenues. This request was based on a future test year of 2012, rather than a historical test year, in order to improve the ability to earn returns allowed by regulators. In 2011, Ameren Missouri received separate rate increases for its electric and natural gas businesses. In January 2011, the MoPSC approved a stipulation and agreement that authorized an increase in annual natural gas delivery revenues of $9 million. In July 2011, the MoPSC issued an order approving an increase in annual revenues for electric service of $173 million. Depreciation for the Sioux scrubbers, previously deferred as a regulatory asset when placed in service in November 2010, will result in an increase in annual expense of $21 million, beginning in August 2011. In addition, capitalization of interest was discontinued in July 2011. The MoPSC also issued an order, in April 2011, with respect to its review of Ameren Missouris FAC for the period from March 1, 2009, to September 30, 2009. The order required Ameren Missouri to refund $18 million, including $1 million for interest, to customers related to earnings associated with certain long term partial requirements sales that were made by Ameren Missouri due to the loss of Norandas load caused by a severe ice storm in January 2009. Ameren Missouri has appealed this decision to the Cole County Circuit Court. The MoPSC is currently conducting its FAC review for periods after September 2009. It is possible that the MoPSC could order additional refunds of $25 million related to periods after September 2009, and this could result in a charge to earnings. Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC in July 2011 for an accounting authority order that would allow Ameren Missouri to recover fixed costs totaling $36 million that were not recovered as a result of the loss of load caused by the severe 2009 ice storm for potential recovery in a future electric rate case. In January 2012, Ameren Missouri made its initial filing under the MEEIA. The MEEIA requires the MoPSC to ensure that a utilitys financial incentives are aligned with helping customers use energy more efficiently, to provide timely cost recovery, and to provide earnings opportunities associated with cost effective energy efficiency programs. Ameren Missouris filing proposes a three year plan that includes a portfolio of energy efficiency programs along with a cost recovery mechanism. If the proposal is approved, beginning in January 2013, Ameren Missouri plans to invest $145 million over three years in the proposed energy efficiency programs. Ameren Missouris second filing, made in February 2012, was a request to increase its annual revenues for electric service by $376 million, which includes recovery of the cost of the proposed energy efficiency programs included in the MEEIA filing. A MoPSC decision in Ameren Missouris MEEIA filing is anticipated in the second quarter of 2012, while an electric rate order is expected in December 2012. Ameren and Ameren Missouri also are pursuing recovery from insurers, through litigation, for reimbursement of unpaid liability insurance claims for a December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at Ameren Missouris Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric energy center. Approximately 340 employees of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Services accepted voluntary separation offers and left the company as of December 31, 2011. As a result of the voluntary separations, Ameren and Ameren Missouri estimate an annual $20 million reduction in operations and maintenance expense beginning in 2012. Ameren Missouris Callaway energy center completed a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage during the fourth quarter of 2011. Ameren Missouris next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage is in the spring of 2013. During a scheduled outage, which occurs every 18 months, maintenance and purchased power costs increase, and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases, versus non outage years. Ameren intends to allocate its capital to those investment opportunities with the highest expected 67 Table of Contents risk adjusted returns. Ameren believes that because of its strategic location in the country, electric transmission may provide it with such an opportunity. In December 2011, MISO approved three projects, which will be developed by ATXI or ATX. The first project, Illinois Rivers, involves building a 345 kilovolt line across the state of Illinois, from the Missouri border to the Indiana border. Work on the first sections of this project will begin in 2012; the expected in service date is 2016. The last section of this project is expected to be completed in 2019. The Spoon River project in northwest Illinois and the Mark Twain project in northeast Missouri are the other two projects approved by MISO in its current transmission expansion plan. These two projects are expected to be completed in 2018. The estimated total investment in these three projects is expected to be more than $1.2 billion. FERC, in its order issued in May 2011, approved transmission rate incentives for the Illinois Rivers project as well as for the Big Muddy project. The Big Muddy project, located primarily in southern Illinois, is currently being evaluated for inclusion in MISOs 2012 transmission expansion plan. During January 2012, the weather conditions in Ameren Missouris and Ameren Illinois service territories were unseasonably warm. Heating degree days in Amerens rate regulated service territories were 14% lower than normal winter weather conditions and 25% lower than weather conditions that occurred during January 2011. For additional information regarding recent rate orders and related appeals, pending requests filed with state and federal regulatory commissions, the FAC prudence review and related appeal, and Taum Sauk matters, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters, and Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Merchant Generation Operations In this period of generally weak power prices, Ameren is focused on improving and reducing the volatility of, operating cash flows within its Merchant Generation business so that cash flows from operations approximate required investments. Merchant Generation has reduced operating costs and sought cost efficient methods to comply with significant environmental requirements. Merchant Generation expects to continue to pursue these strategies while positioning themselves for an expected future recovery in power prices and margins. As part of this strategy Genco closed its Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers at the end of 2011, primarily because environmental investments expected to be required were not economical. The closures and the retention of these energy centers emission allowances create flexibility to lower compliance costs at other Merchant Generation energy centers. In addition, the closure of the Hutsonville and Meredosia energy centers is not expected to have a material impact on Amerens or Gencos future earnings. In 2011, nearly all of Merchant Generations margin was generated from sales of output from five baseload energy centers (Newton, Joppa, Coffeen, E.D. Edwards, and Duck Creek). The Merchant Generation segment expects to have available generation from its coal fired energy centers of 32.5 million megawatthours in 2012. However, based on currently expected power prices, the Merchant Generation segment expects to generate approximately 27 million (Genco 20 million) megawatthours of power in 2012. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of environmental matters and compliance plans. Power prices in the Midwest affect the amount of revenues and cash flows Merchant Generation and Genco can generate by marketing power into the wholesale and retail markets. Market prices for power have decreased over the past three years. During 2012, the market price for power for delivery in the current year has declined below 2011 levels because of factors such as declining natural gas prices and the stay of the CSAPR. From December 31, 2011, through January 31, 2012, the market price for power at the Indiana Hub decreased by 12%. Amerens Merchant Generation segment and Genco will be adversely impacted by the declining market price of power for any unhedged generation. Merchant Generation and Genco are currently evaluating this recent price decline and the impact of the stay of the CSAPR, and the potential impact these events may have on their operating and capital investment plans. In 2012, Genco decelerated the construction of two scrubbers at its Newton energy center, and AERG removed from its five year capital expenditures forecast previously planned precipitator upgrades at its E.D. Edwards energy center. Based on current environmental rules and regulations, if Merchant Generation and Genco do not complete these environmental upgrades by the beginning of 2015, Merchant Generation and Genco may need to reduce generation output at their energy centers to reduce emissions. Merchant Generation and Genco will also evaluate whether the decline in the market price for power in the first quarter of 2012, and any changes to operating and capital plans, is indicative that the carrying value of its energy centers may not be recoverable. A failure to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results and cash flows, or a reduction in the expected useful lives of Merchant Generations energy centers could result in the recognition of long lived asset impairment charges. Merchant Generations energy centers without pollution control equipment are most exposed to declining power prices as compliance options for environmental laws and regulations could become prohibitively expensive. To reduce cash flow volatility, Marketing Company, through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts, targets to hedge Merchant Generations expected output by 80% to 90% for the following year, 50% to 68 Table of Contents 70% for two years out, and 30% to 50% for three years out. As of January 31, 2012, Marketing Company had hedged approximately 25 million megawatthours of Merchant Generations expected generation for 2012, at an average price of $44 per megawatthour. For 2013, Marketing Company had hedged approximately 14 million megawatthours of Merchant Generations forecasted generation sales at an average price of $40 per megawatthour. For 2014, Marketing Company had hedged approximately 7 million megawatthours of Merchant Generations forecasted generation sales at an average price of $44 per megawatthour. Any unhedged forecasted generation will be exposed to market prices at the time of sale. As a result, any new physical or financial power sales may be at price levels lower than previously experienced and lower than the value of existing hedged sales. Merchant Generation is also supporting development of an energy capacity market within MISO, which is expected to support longer term investment. FERC is expected to issue an order on MISOs proposal to establish a capacity market within the RTO. The MISO proposal calls for the first annual capacity auction to be held in April 2013 for the June 2013 to May 2014 planning year. To further reduce cash flow volatility, Merchant Generation seeks to hedge fuel costs consistent with power sales. As of January 31, 2012, for 2012 Merchant Generation had hedged fuel costs for approximately 25 million megawatthours of coal and up to 28 million megawatthours of base transportation at about $24 per megawatthour. For 2013, Merchant Generation had hedged fuel costs for approximately 12 million megawatthours of coal and up to 27 million megawatthours of base transportation at about $25.50 per megawatthour. For 2014, Merchant Generation had hedged fuel costs for approximately 5 million megawatthours of coal and up to 21 million megawatthours of base transportation at about $25.50 per megawatthour. In 2012, Genco and the Merchant Generation segment are targeting a reduction in coal inventories. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report for additional information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for 2012 through 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Ameren Companies seek to maintain access to the capital markets at commercially attractive rates in order to fund their businesses. The enhancement of regulatory frameworks and returns is expected to improve cash flows, credit metrics, and related access to capital for Amerens rate regulated businesses. Genco and the Merchant Generation segment seek to fund their operations internally and therefore seek not to rely on financing from Ameren or external, third party sources. Genco and the Merchant Generation segment will continue to seek to defer capital and operating expenses, sell certain assets, and take other actions as necessary to fund their operations internally while maintaining safe and reliable operations. Under its indenture, Genco may not borrow additional funds from external, third party sources if its interest coverage ratio is less than a specified minimum or its leverage ratio is greater than a specified maximum. Based on projections as of December 31, 2011, of Gencos operating results and cash flows, we expect that, by the end of the first quarter of 2013, Gencos interest coverage ratio will be less than the minimum ratio required for the company to borrow additional funds from external, third party sources. Gencos indenture does not restrict intercompany borrowings from Amerens non state regulated subsidiary money pool. However, borrowings from the money pool are subject to Amerens control, and if a Genco intercompany financing need were to arise, borrowings from the non state regulated subsidiary money pool by Genco would be dependent on consideration by Ameren of the facts and circumstances existing at that time. The Ameren Companies have also entered into multiyear credit facility agreements that cumulatively provide $2.1 billion of credit through September 10, 2013. We believe that our liquidity is adequate given our expected operating cash flows, capital expenditures, and related financing plans. However, there can be no assurance that significant changes in economic conditions, disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or other unforeseen events will not materially affect our ability to execute our expected operating, capital or financing plans. In September 2012, $173 million of Ameren Missouris 5.25% senior secured notes mature. As of December 31, 2011, Ameren had approximately $390 million in federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards (Ameren Missouri $140 million, Ameren Illinois $90 million, Genco $20 million) and $72 million in federal income tax credit carryforwards (Ameren Missouri $11 million, Ameren Illinois $ million, Genco $1 million). These carryforwards are expected to satisfy income tax liabilities through the end of 2013 (Ameren Missouri 2012, Ameren Illinois 2012, Genco 2013). Between 2012 and 2021, Ameren currently expects to invest between $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion to retrofit its coal fired energy centers with pollution control equipment in compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Any pollution control investments will result in decreased energy center availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses. Any pollution control investments at Ameren Missouri are expected to be recoverable from ratepayers, subject to prudence reviews. Regulatory lag may materially affect the timing of such recovery and returns on the investments, and therefore affect our cash flows and related financing needs. The recoverability of amounts expended in our Merchant Generation segment will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions reflecting increased environmental costs for coal fired generators. 69 Table of Contents In October 2011, Amerens board of directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of 40 cents per common share, a 3.9% increase from the prior quarterly dividend of 38.5 cents per share, resulting in an annualized equivalent dividend of $1.60 per share. Based on the shares outstanding at the end of October 2011, on an annual basis, the dividend increase will result in additional dividends of $15 million. In February 2012, Ameren completed the asset sale of its Medina Valley energy centers net property and plant for cash proceeds of $16 million. The loss of margin contributed by Medina Valley is not expected to materially impact Amerens 2012 results of operations. Ameren and Genco are currently exploring opportunities to make the Meredosia energy center available for those parties interested in repowering one of its units to create an oxy fuel combustion coal fired energy center designed for permanent CO2 capture and storage. REGULATORY MATTERS See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report. ACCOUNTING MATTERS Critical Accounting Estimates Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. These estimates involve judgments regarding many factors which in and of themselves could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. We have outlined below the critical accounting estimates that we believe are most difficult, subjective, or complex. Any change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results. Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois defer costs in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, and make investments that they assume will be collected in future rates. Regulatory environment and external regulatory decisions and requirements Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact Impact of deregulation, rate freezes, prudency reviews, and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs Beginning in 2012, Ameren Illinois assessment of and ability to estimate the current years electric delivery service costs to be reflected in revenues and recovered from customers in a subsequent year under the IEIMA performance based formula ratemaking process Basis for Judgment We determine which costs are recoverable by consulting previous rulings by state regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we operate and any other factors that may indicate whether cost recovery is probable. If facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery or that plant assets are probable of disallowance, we record a charge to earnings, which could be material. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for quantification of these assets for each of the Ameren Companies, excluding Genco. Unbilled Revenue At the end of each period, Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois project expected usage and estimate the amount of revenue to record for services that have been provided to customers but not yet billed. Projecting customer energy usage Estimating impacts of weather and other usage affecting factors for the unbilled period Estimating loss of energy during transmission and delivery Basis for Judgment We base our estimate of unbilled revenue each period on the volume of energy delivered, as valued by a model of billing cycles and historical usage rates and growth by customer class for our service area. This figure is then adjusted for the modeled impact of seasonal and weather variations based on historical results. See the balance sheets for each of the Ameren Companies, excluding Genco, under Part II, Item 8, of this report for unbilled revenue amounts. 70 Table of Contents Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Derivative Financial Instruments We account for derivative financial instruments and measure their fair value in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance. The identification and classification of a derivative and the fair value of such derivative must be determined. See Commodity Price Risk and Fair Value of Contracts in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 8 Fair Value Measurements under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Our ability to identify derivatives Our ability to assess whether derivative contracts qualify for the NPNS exception Our ability to consume or produce notional values of derivative contracts Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility and liquidity Valuation assumptions on longer term contracts due to lack of observable inputs Effectiveness of derivatives that have been designated as hedges Counterparty default risk Basis for Judgment We evaluate contracts to determine whether they contain derivatives. Determining whether or not a contract qualifies as a derivative under authoritative accounting guidance requires us to exercise significant judgment in interpreting the definition of a derivative and applying that definition. Authoritative accounting guidance regarding derivative instruments requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values, unless the NPNS exception applies. We determine whether to exclude the fair value of certain derivatives from valuation under the NPNS provisions of authoritative accounting guidance after assessing our intent and ability to physically deliver commodities purchased and sold. Further, our forecasted purchases and sales also support our designation of some fair valued derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. Fair value of our derivatives is measured in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, which provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When we do not have observable inputs, we use certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation. Our valuations also reflect our own assessment of counterparty default risk, guided by the best internal and external information available. If we were required to discontinue our use of the NPNS exception or cash flow hedge treatment for some of our contracts, the impact of changes in fair value for the applicable contracts could be material to our earnings and financial position. Valuation of Long Lived Assets and Asset Retirement Obligations We periodically assess the carrying value of our long lived assets to determine whether they are impaired. We also review for the existence of asset retirement obligations. If an asset retirement obligation is identified, we determine its fair value and subsequently reassess and adjust the obligation, as necessary. Managements identification of impairment indicators Changes in business, industry, laws, technology, or economic and market conditions Valuation assumptions and conclusions Our assessment of market participants Estimated useful lives of our significant long lived assets Actions or assessments by our regulators Identification of an asset retirement obligation and assumptions about the timing of asset removals Basis for Judgment Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a valuation may have changed, we use various methodologies that we believe market participants would use to determine valuations and discounted, undiscounted, and probabilistic discounted cash flow models with multiple operating scenarios. The identification of asset retirement obligations is conducted through the review of legal documents and interviews. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for quantification of our asset retirement obligations. See Note 17 Goodwill, Impairment and Other Charges under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information of our long lived asset impairment evaluation and charges recorded. 71 Table of Contents Accounting Estimate Uncertainties Affecting Application Benefit Plan Accounting Based on actuarial calculations, we accrue costs of providing future employee benefits in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance regarding benefit plans. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report. Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations Health care cost trend rates Timing of employee retirements and mortality assumptions Ability to recover certain benefit plan costs from our ratepayers Changing market conditions that may affect investment and interest rate environments Impacts of the health care reform legislation enacted in 2010 Basis for Judgment Our ultimate selection of the discount rate, health care trend rate, and expected rate of return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on our consistent application of assumption setting methodologies and our review of available historical, current, and projected rates, as applicable. See Note 11 Retirement Benefits under Part II, Item 8, of this report for sensitivity of Amerens benefit plans to potential changes in these assumptions. Accounting for Contingencies We make judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, environmental remediation, the actions of various regulatory agencies, or other matters that occur in the normal course of business. We record a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. A gain contingency is not recorded until realized or realizable. Estimating financial impact of events Estimating likelihood of outcomes Regulatory and political environments and requirements Outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors Basis for Judgment The determination of a loss contingency requires significant judgment as to the expected outcome of each contingency in future periods. In making the determination as to the amount of potential loss and the probability of loss, we consider all available evidence including the expected outcome of potential litigation. If no estimate is better than another within our range of estimates, we record our best estimate of a loss or the minimum value of our estimated range of outcomes. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to the contingency and revise our estimates. In our evaluation of legal matters, management consults with legal counsel and relies on analysis of relevant case law and legal precedents. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 10 Callaway Energy Center, and Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on the Ameren Companies contingencies. Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report. EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Amerens rates for retail electric and natural gas utility service are regulated by the MoPSC and the ICC. Nonretail electric rates are regulated by FERC. Rate regulation is generally based on the recovery of historical or projected costs. As a result, revenue increases could lag behind changing prices. Ameren Illinois has recently elected to participate in the performance based formula ratemaking process for determining retail rates for its electric delivery service business established by the IEIMA. Ameren Illinois participation in this formula ratemaking process will terminate if the average residential rate increases by more than 2.5% annually from June 2011 through May 2014. The average residential rate includes generation service, which is outside of Ameren Illinois control as it is required to purchase all of its power through procurement processes administered by the IPA. The cost of procured power can be affected by inflation. Within that formula, the monthly average yields of 30 year United States Treasury bonds are the basis for Ameren Illinois return on equity. Therefore, pending ICC approval of Ameren Illinois initial filing under the IEIMA, which is expected to occur in October 2012, there will be a direct correlation between the yield of United States Treasury bonds, which are affected by inflation, and the earnings of Ameren Illinois electric distribution business. Inflation affects our operations, earnings, stockholders equity, and financial performance. 72 Table of Contents The current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost. Under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers. As a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years. Amerens Merchant Generation business does not have regulated recovery mechanisms and is therefore dependent on market prices for power to reflect rising costs. Ameren Missouri recovers the cost of fuel for electric generation and the cost of purchased power by adjusting rates as allowed through the FAC. Ameren Illinois recovers power supply costs from electric customers by adjusting rates through a rider mechanism to accommodate changes in power prices. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are affected by changes in the cost of electric transmission services. FERC regulates the rates charged and the terms and conditions for electric transmission services. Each RTO separately files regional transmission tariff rates for approval by FERC. All members within that RTO are then subjected to those rates. Because they are members of MISO, Ameren Missouris and Ameren Illinois transmission rates are calculated in accordance with MISOs rate formula. The transmission rate, updated in June of each year, is based on FERC filings for the previous year. This rate is charged directly to wholesale customers. Ameren Illinois also charges this rate directly to alternative retail electric suppliers. For Illinois retail customers who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier, the transmission rate is collected through a rider mechanism. This rate is not directly charged to Missouri retail customers because the MoPSC includes transmission related costs in setting bundled retail rates in Missouri. In our Missouri and Illinois retail natural gas utility jurisdictions, changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through PGA clauses. Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent that they must purchase natural gas to run CTs. These companies have structured various supply agreements to maintain access to multiple natural gas pools and supply basins, and to minimize the impact to their financial statements. Ameren Missouris exposure to changes in market prices of natural gas is mitigated by its ability to recover increasing costs via a FAC. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, below for additional information. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on the cost recovery mechanisms. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument, derivative or nonderivative, caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates, commodity prices, and equity security prices. A derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on, or derived from, the value of some underlying asset or index. The following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. We handle market risks in accordance with established policies, which may include entering into various derivative transactions. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks, principally business, legal, and operational risks, are not part of the following discussion. Our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets and to pursue market opportunities within prudent risk parameters. Our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee, which is composed of senior level Ameren officers. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with: long term and short term variable rate debt; fixed rate debt; auction rate long term debt; and defined pension and postretirement benefit plans. We manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of debt instruments we have within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. For defined pension and postretirement benefit plans, we control the duration and the portfolio mix of our plan assets. The following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by 1% on variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2011: Interest Expense Net Income(a) Ameren(b) $ 4 $ (2 ) Ameren Missouri 2 (1 ) Ameren Illinois (c ) (c ) Genco (a) Calculations are based on an estimated tax rate of 40%, 38%, 41% and 41% for Ameren, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and Genco, respectively. (b) Includes intercompany eliminations. (c) Less than $1 million. The estimated changes above do not consider the potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist 73 Table of Contents in such an environment. In the event of a significant change in interest rates, management would probably act to mitigate further exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that might be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted. Exchange traded contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the respective exchanges and have nominal credit risk. In all other transactions, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on the potential loss on counterparty exposure as of December 31, 2011. Our rate regulated revenues are primarily derived from sales or delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers in Missouri and Illinois. Our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and executory contracts with market risk exposures. The risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base. At December 31, 2011, no nonaffiliated customer represented more than 10%, in the aggregate, of our accounts receivable at Ameren Illinois. Noranda, Ameren Missouris largest nonaffiliated electric customer, has appealed certain aspects of the 2009 and 2010 rate orders issued by the MoPSC. Noranda has paid into court registries amounts that represent more than 10%, in the aggregate, of Ameren Missouris accounts receivable at December 31, 2011. In November 2011, the Missouri Court of Appeals issued a ruling that upheld the MoPSCs January 2009 electric rate order. Therefore, Ameren Missouri expects to receive all of the funds held in the Stoddard County Circuit Courts registry relating to the 2009 rate order, which totaled $20 million as of December 31, 2011, during the first quarter of 2012. The funds related to the 2010 appeal will remain in the Cole County Circuit Courts registry pending resolution, which is expected in 2012. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. The risk associated with Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas trade receivables is also mitigated by a rate adjustment mechanism that allows Ameren Illinois to recover the difference between its actual bad debt expense under GAAP and the bad debt expense included in its base rates. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois continue to monitor the impact of increasing rates on customer collections. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois make adjustments to their allowance for doubtful accounts as deemed necessary to ensure that such allowances are adequate to cover estimated uncollectible customer account balances. Ameren, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and Genco may have credit exposure associated with off system or wholesale purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2011, Amerens, Ameren Missouris, Ameren Illinois and Gencos combined credit exposure to nonaffiliated trading counterparties, excluding coal suppliers, deemed below investment grade either through external or internal credit evaluations, was $48 million, net of collateral (2010 $204 million). Almost all of the $48 million exposure relates to Ameren Illinois long term purchase power and renewable energy credit contracts. These contracts were procured through the IPA and are passed through directly to Ameren Illinois customers. At December 31, 2011, the combined credit exposures to nonaffiliated coal suppliers, deemed below investment grade either through external or internal credit evaluations, net of collateral, were $35 million, $33 million and $2 million at Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco, respectively. (2010 $ 19 million, $8 million, $10 million, respectively). We establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program. Monitoring involves daily exposure reporting to senior management, master trading and netting agreements, and credit support, such as letters of credit and parental guarantees. We also analyze each counterpartys financial condition before we enter into sales, forwards, swaps, futures, or option contracts. We estimate our credit exposure to MISO associated with the MISO Energy and Operating Reserves Market to be $29 million at December 31, 2011 (2010 $53 million). Equity Price Risk Our costs for providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, including the rate of return on plan assets. Ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in ERISA. Amerens goal is to ensure that sufficient funds are available to provide the benefits at the time they are payable while also to maximizing total return on plan assets and minimizing expense volatility consistent with its tolerance for risk. Ameren delegates investment management to specialists. Where appropriate, Ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types. Ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio. Projected rates of return for each asset class were estimated after an analysis of historical experience, future expectations, and the volatility of the various asset classes. After considering the target asset allocation for each asset class, we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared with benchmark returns, and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets. 74 Table of Contents In future years, the costs of such plans will be reflected in net income, OCI, or regulatory assets. Contributions to the plans could increase materially, if we do not achieve pension and postretirement asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our 2012 assumed return on plan assets of 7.75% and 7.50%, respectively. Ameren Missouri also maintains a trust fund, as required by the NRC and Missouri law, to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning. As of December 31, 2011, this fund was invested primarily in domestic equity securities (66%) and debt securities (34%). It totaled $357 million (2010 $337 million). By maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments, Ameren Missouri seeks to maximize the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk. However, the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets. The debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. Ameren Missouri actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options. Ameren Missouris exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated, because Ameren Missouri is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs, which would include unfavorable investment results, through electric rates. Additionally, Ameren has company owned life insurance contracts that are used to support Amerens deferred compensation plans. These life insurance contracts include equity and debt investments that are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and to changes in interest rates. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in market prices for power, emission allowances, coal, transportation diesel, natural gas and uranium. Amerens, Ameren Missouris and Gencos risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements. Merchant Generation also seeks to sell power forward to wholesale, municipal, and industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices. We also attempt to mitigate financial risks through risk management programs and policies, which include forward hedging programs, and through the use of derivative financial instruments (primarily forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts, and financial swap contracts). However, a portion of the generation capacity of Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco is not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices. The following table shows how our earnings might decrease if power prices were to decrease by 1% on unhedged economic generation for 2012 through 2015: Net Income(a) Ameren(b) $ (13 ) Ameren Missouri (c ) Genco (11 ) (a) Calculations are based on an estimated tax rate of 40%, 38% and 41% for Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco, respectively. (b) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. (c) Less than $1 million. Amerens forward hedging power programs include the use of derivative financial swap contracts. These swap contracts financially settle a fixed price against a floating price. The floating price is typically the realized, or settled, price at a liquid regional hub at some forward period of time. Ameren controls the use of derivative financial swap contracts with volumetric and correlation limits that are intended to mitigate any material adverse financial impact. Historically, Ameren has used swaps that settled against the Cinergy Hub MISO locational marginal pricing. This hub had traditionally been the most liquid location, with a strong correlation to the pricing that was realized at our generating locations. As of December 31, 2011, MISO stopped publishing Cinergy Hub pricing. As a result, Ameren will now use the Indiana Hub and other hubs as necessary for financial hedging. Ameren does not expect any material adverse financial impact to the outcomes of its forward hedging programs as a result of this change. Ameren will continue to pursue the best available options to fix pricing for the output of its generating units. Ameren also uses its portfolio management and trading capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy risk capital to generate additional returns. Due to our physical presence in the market, we are able to identify and pursue opportunities, which can generate additional returns through portfolio management and trading activities. All of this activity is performed within a controlled risk management process. We establish value at risk (VaR) and stop loss limits that are intended to prevent any material negative financial impact. We manage risks associated with changing prices of fuel for generation with techniques similar to those we use to manage risks associated with changing market prices for electricity. Merchant Generation does not have the ability to pass higher fuel costs through to its customers for electric operations with the exception of an immaterial percentage of the output that has been contracted with a fuel cost pass through. Ameren Missouri has a FAC that allows Ameren Missouri to recover, through customer rates, 95% of changes in fuel and purchased power costs, net of off system revenues, including MISO costs and revenues, more or less than the amount set in base rates, without a traditional rate proceeding. Ameren Missouri remains exposed to the remaining 5%. 75 Table of Contents Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco have entered into coal contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal to manage their exposure to fuel prices. The coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility. Additionally, the type of coal burned is part of Ameren Missouris environmental compliance strategy. Ameren Missouri has a multiyear agreement to purchase ultra low sulfur coal through 2017 to comply with the CSAPR and other environmental regulations. The coal contract is with a single supplier. Disruptions of the deliveries of that ultra low sulfur coal from the supplier could compromise Ameren Missouris ability to operate in compliance with emission standards. Other sources of ultra low sulfur coal are limited and the construction of pollution control equipment requires significant lead time to become operational. Should a temporary disruption of ultra low sulfur coal deliveries occur and its existing inventory of ultra low sulfur coal becomes fully depleted, and other sources of ultra low sulfur coal are not available, Ameren Missouri would use its existing emission allowances or purchase emission allowances in order to achieve compliance with environmental regulations. Genco purchases coal based on expected power sales, generally through bid procedures. Therefore, Gencos forward coal requirements are dependent on the volume of power sales that have been contracted. Transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs. Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility. Natural gas transportation expenses for Amerens gas distribution utility companies and for the gas fired generation units of Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco are regulated by FERC through approved tariffs governing the rates, terms, and conditions of transportation and storage services. Certain firm transportation and storage capacity agreements held by the Ameren Companies include rights to extend the term of contracts. Depending on our competitive position, we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariff rates for our requirements. In addition, coal transportation costs are sensitive to the price of diesel fuel as a result of rail freight fuel surcharges. We use forward fuel oil contracts (both for heating and crude oil) to mitigate this market price risk as changes in these products are highly correlated to changes in diesel markets. If diesel fuel costs were to increase or decrease by $0.25 a gallon, Amerens fuel expense could increase or decrease by $14 million annually (Ameren Missouri $8 million, Genco $5 million). As of December 31, 2011, Ameren had a price cap for approximately 87% of expected fuel surcharges in 2012. In the event of a significant change in coal prices, Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources. With regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel, Ameren Missouri has fixed priced, base price with escalation, and market priced agreements. It uses inventories to provide some price hedge to fulfill its Callaway energy centers needs for uranium, conversion, and enrichment. There is no fuel reloading or planned maintenance outage scheduled for 2012 and 2015. Ameren Missouri has price hedges for approximately 74% of its 2013 to 2016 nuclear fuel requirements. Nuclear fuel market prices remain subject to an unpredictable supply and demand environment. Ameren Missouri has continued to follow a strategy of managing its inventory of nuclear fuel as an inherent price hedge. New long term uranium contracts are almost exclusively market price related with an escalating price floor. New long term enrichment contracts usually have a base price with escalation price mechanism, and may also have either a market price related component or market based price re benchmarking. Ameren Missouri expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the Callaway energy center, at prices that cannot now be accurately predicted. Unlike the electricity and natural gas markets, nuclear fuel markets have somewhat limited financial instruments available for price hedging, so most hedging is done through inventories and forward contracts, if they are available. The electric generating operations for Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run CTs. The natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs. We optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins. Through the market allocation and auction process, Ameren and Ameren Missouri have been granted FTRs associated with the MISO Energy and Operating Reserves Market. In addition, Marketing Company has acquired FTRs for its participation in the PJM Northern Illinois and MISO market. The FTRs are intended to mitigate electric transmission congestion charges related to the physical constraints of the transmission system. Depending on the congestion, FTRs could result in either charges or credits. Complex grid modeling tools are used to determine which FTRs to nominate in the FTR allocation process. There is a risk of incorrectly modeling the amount of FTRs needed, and there is the potential that the FTRs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges. With regard to Ameren Missouris and Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas distribution businesses, exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery mechanisms in place. These cost recovery mechanisms allow Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to pass on to retail customers prudently 76 Table of Contents incurred costs for fuel, purchased power, and gas supply. Ameren Missouris and Ameren Illinois strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations for their regulated customers. The effects of price volatility cannot be eliminated. However, procurement strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier, as well as the management of physical assets. The following table presents, as of December 31, 2011, the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired energy centers, nuclear fuel for Ameren Missouris Callaway energy center, natural gas for our CTs and retail distribution, as appropriate, and purchased power needs of Ameren Illinois, which does not own generation, that are price hedged over the period 2012 through 2016. The projected required supply of these commodities could be significantly affected by changes in our assumptions for such matters as customer demand for our electric generation and our electric and natural gas distribution services, generation output, and inventory levels, among other matters. 2012 2013 2014 2016 Ameren(a): Coal(c) 99 % 73 % 57 % Coal transportation(c) 100 98 88 Nuclear fuel 100 92 64 Natural gas for generation 20 1 Natural gas for distribution(b) 87 35 16 Purchased power for Ameren Illinois(d) 87 52 4 Ameren Missouri: Coal 100 % 98 % 90 % Coal transportation 100 97 97 Nuclear fuel 100 92 64 Natural gas for generation 12 3 Natural gas for distribution(b) 90 28 12 Ameren Illinois: Natural gas for distribution(b) 87 % 36 % 16 % Purchased power(d) 87 52 4 Genco: Coal(c) 89 % 32 % 17 % Coal transportation(c) 100 100 71 Natural gas for generation 32 (a) Includes amounts for Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations.

With regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for construction and maintenance activities, Ameren is exposed to changes in market prices for metal commodities and to labor availability. See Supply for Electric Power under Part I, Item 1, of this report for the percentages of our historical needs satisfied by coal, nuclear power, natural gas, hydroelectric power, and oil. Also see Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. 77 Table of Contents Fair Value of Contracts Most of our commodity contracts that meet the definition of derivatives qualify for treatment as NPNS. We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, diesel, power, and uranium. The following table presents the favorable (unfavorable) changes in the fair value of all derivative contracts marked to market during the year ended December 31, 2011. We use various methods to determine the fair value of our contracts. In accordance authoritative accounting guidance for fair value with hierarchy levels, the sources we used to determine the fair value of these contracts were active quotes (Level 1), inputs corroborated by market data (Level 2), and other modeling and valuation methods that are not corroborated by market data (Level 3).
