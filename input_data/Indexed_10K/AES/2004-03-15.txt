ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Executive Summary and Overview AES is a global power company managed to profitably meet the growing demand for electricity. AES is a holding company that through its subsidiaries operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. We seek to capture the benefits of our global expertise and the economies of scale in our operations. Predictable cash flow, an efficient capital structure and world class operating performance are the focus of our management efforts. We report our financial results in four business segments: contract generation, competitive supply, large utilities and growth distribution. These segments are grouped further to report our regulated and non regulated businesses. Regulated revenues include our large utilities and growth distribution segments. Our large utility and growth distribution segments consist of 17 distribution companies with over 11 million end user customers, most significantly representing three large utilities located in the U.S. (IPL), Brazil (Eletropaulo) and Venezuela (EDC). All three of these utilities are of significant size and all maintain a monopoly franchise within a defined service area. Our contract generation and competitive supply segments consist of multiple power plants located around the world. AES has over 38 gigawatts of generating capacity from 103 power plants on 5 continents. In most cases, these facilities are contract generation plants that have contractually limited their exposure to commodity price risks and electricity price volatility by entering into long term (five years or longer) power sales agreements for 75% or more of their output capacity. Through these contractual agreements, the businesses generally reduce the commodity and electricity price volatility and thereby increase the predictability of their cash flows and earnings. Competitive supply consists primarily of power plants selling electricity to wholesale customers through competitive markets and, as a result, the cash flows and earnings of such businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price of electricity, natural gas and coal. Beginning in 2002 and continuing through 2003, we also have concentrated on several key strategic initiatives that have and will continue to have a material impact on our business. These include: concentrating on strengthening the operating performance and cost efficiency of our businesses to improve our cash flows, earnings and return on invested capital; selling assets to decrease the parent companys dependence on access to the capital markets and improving the strength of our balance sheet by reducing financial leverage and improving liquidity; restructuring the ownership and financing structure of certain subsidiaries (primarily in South America) to improve their long term prospects for acceptable returns on invested capital or to extend their previously short term debt maturities; selling or discontinuing several under performing businesses that no longer met our investment criteria; and executing refinancing initiatives designed to primarily improve our parent company financial position and credit quality by paying off debt, lengthening and levelizing maturities, and lowering interest charges. Our financial results for 2003 reflect the impacts of these strategic initiatives with improvements in sales and operating margins (revenues less cost of sales) across each of our four business segments for 2003. Our results also include the impacts of selling and discontinuing several businesses. Accordingly, we experienced significant losses from discontinued operations in 2002 and 2003 as well as impairment charges related to assets held for sale and terminated development and construction projects. The proceeds from these sales were used to improve our liquidity and reduce outstanding debt. We reduced 36 parent company debt over the year by $1.2 billion (including the secured equity linked loan previously issued by AES New York Funding L.L.C.). Overall our revenues from continuing operations increased 14% to $8.4 billion from 2002 to 2003 and our operating margin increased 25% over 2002 to $2.4 billion for 2003. The operating margin percentage (representing operating margin relative to revenues) increased to 29% of revenues for 2003 as compared to 26% for 2002. Revenues and operating margins also increased during 2002 in each of our five geographic segments North America, South America, Europe/Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. Contract generation and large utilities, our two most significant segments, represent 37% and 39%, respectively of our revenues and 52% and 31%, respectively, of our operating margin. Revenues and operating margin contribution continued to be most significant in the contract generation segment. In 2003, recently completed contract generation power plants in the Caribbean and Asia contributed to an overall increase in revenues and also contributed better than average segment operating margin percentages compared to the total portfolio of generating plants. Improvements in contract generation operating margins at existing facilities occurred in Chile, Brazil and Pakistan while our Shady Point plant in the U.S. experienced lower operating margins due to an expected step down in contract rates. Competitive supply power plants experienced higher operating margins during 2003 due to higher electricity prices in New York and the stronger currency relative to the U.S. dollar in Argentina. The large utility segment revenues and the operating margin percentage improved from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to higher adjusted tariffs and improved currency conditions in Brazil. Large utility operating margin also increased as a result of an $82 million bad debt impairment at Eletropaulo in Brazil during 2002. Our growth distribution segment experienced higher revenues and operating margins as a result of improvements in the results of our distribution companies in El Salvador and Cameroon. Regulatory asset impairment charges taken by Sul in Brazil during 2002 also contributed to the increase in operating margins. These improvements were partially offset by declines in the operating margins in our Argentine growth distribution businesses in 2003. Strategic Initiatives Affecting Results of Operations Performance Improvements During 2003, our contract generation and competitive supply businesses continued to improve their operating performance. The twelve month rolling average availability factor for our generation fleet improved from 85% at the beginning of 2003 to 88% at the end of the year. Some of the major performance improvement initiatives undertaken during 2003 include; implementing a fleet wide approach to optimizing gas turbine maintenance costs, improving our businesses heat rates where it was economical to do so and implementing a reliability centered maintenance program to improve the reliability while reducing the maintenance costs at our businesses. With respect to our large utilities and growth distribution businesses, our management focus is to capture economies of scale and leverage expertise and skills to maintain our position as a low cost, efficient producer and distributor of electricity. Supplier relationships and distribution system planning and design benefit from our economies of scale and the depth of our expertise. One important key performance indicator for these businesses is the level of losses. Losses are an expense and are generally defined as the difference between energy purchased or generated and energy billed. Losses can result from several factors. Some losses are the result of physics as energy is lost when converted into heat, referred to as technical losses. Our overall loss rate for non U.S. utilities reduced by the end of 2003. Other performance initiatives include the launch in March 2003 of a strategic sourcing initiative that captured cost reductions through the implementation of improved purchasing practices throughout the Company. We also have redeployed talent developed from our restructuring efforts to manage complex 37 transaction and commercial issues in many of our businesses. These skills are a valuable resource as we monitor regulatory and tariff schemes to determine our capital budgeting needs and integrate acquisitions. The Company expects to realize cost reduction and performance improvement benefits in both earnings and cash flows; however, there can be no assurance that the reductions and improvements will continue and our inability to sustain the reductions and improvements may result in less than expected earnings and cash flows in 2004 and beyond. Asset Sales During 2003, we continued the initiative to sell all or part of certain of the Companys subsidiaries. This initiative was designed to decrease the Companys dependence on access to capital markets and improve the strength of our balance sheet by reducing financial leverage and improving liquidity. The following chart details the asset sales that were closed during 2003. Project Name Date Completed Sales Proceeds (in millions) Location CILCORP/Medina Valley January 2003 $495 United States AES Ecogen/AES Mt.

However given the improvements in our liquidity there will be a lower emphasis placed on asset sales in the future for purposes of improving liquidity and strengthening the balance sheet. For any sales that happen in the future, there can be no guarantee that the proceeds from such sale transactions will cover the entire investment in the subsidiaries. Depending on which businesses are eventually sold, the entire or partial sale of any business may change the current financial characteristics of the Companys portfolio and results of operations. Furthermore future sales may impact the amount of recurring earnings and cash flows the Company would expect to achieve. Subsidiary Restructuring During 2003, we completed and initiated restructuring transactions for several of our South American businesses. The efforts are focused on improving the businesses long term prospects for generating acceptable returns on invested capital or extending short term debt maturities. Businesses impacted include Eletropaulo, Tiete, Uruguaiana and Sul in Brazil and Gener in Chile. Brazil Eletropaulo. AES has owned an interest in Eletropaulo since April 1998, when the company was privatized. In February 2002 AES acquired a controlling interest in the business and as a consequence started to consolidate it. AES financed a significant portion of the acquisition of Eletropaulo, including both common and preferred shares, through loans and deferred purchase price financing arrangements provided by the Brazilian National Development Bank ("BNDES"), and its wholly owned subsidiary, BNDES Participa&ccedil;&otilde;es S.A. ("BNDESPAR"), to AESs subsidiaries, AES Elpa S.A. ("AES Elpa") and AES Transgas Empreendimentos, S.A. ("AES Transgas"). 38 Despite an interim restructuring in 2002, AES Elpa and AES Transgas were unable to meet scheduled maturities in 2003. On January 30, 2003 and March 3, 2003 these loans entered into default. BNDES did not exercise its right to accelerate those loan amounts after the defaults. BNDES also elected not to exercise its cross default rights with respect to Eletropaulos rationing loans. Further, these defaults also gave certain lenders to Eletropaulo acceleration rights that were not exercised. After several months of negotiations with BNDES, we were able to execute a restructuring agreement, which included the following major terms. Creation of Brasiliana Energia S.A., a new holding company owned by AES, through a direct ownership of 50.01% of common shares, and BNDESPAR, through a direct ownership of 49.99% of common shares and ownership of non voting preferred shares giving BNDES approximately 53.84% of total equity capital of Brasiliana Energia S.A.; AES transfered ownership of AES Uruguaiana Empreendimentos Ltda., AES Tiete SA and Eletropaulo to Brasiliana Energia S.A.; AES contributed $90 million to Brasiliana Energia S.A. for future payment of debt; and Reduction of BNDES debt from approximately $1.3 billion (including interest) to $510 million evidenced by debentures which are convertible into shares of Brasiliana Energia S.A. upon the occurrence of an event of default, which would give BNDESPAR control of Brasiliana Energia S.A. The transaction became effective on January 30, 2004 after approval from ANEEL and the Central Bank of Brazil as well as payment of $90 million by AES. Additionally, in December 2003, Eletropaulo reached an agreement with its commercial lenders with respect to the terms and conditions of a new transaction to reprofile this outstanding debt over the next five years. This new transaction will resolve all outstanding defaults and accelerations with Eletropaulos commercial lenders. As the result of this transaction approximately 70% of the reprofiled debt will be denominated in Brazilian Reais. Closing of the Eletropaulo reprofiling transaction is subject to definitive documentation that is expected to be entered into on or shortly after March 15, 2004. Tiete. Due to dividend restrictions under Brazilian corporate law, Tietes dividends may not be sufficient to make payments due in 2004 and 2005 on approximately $295 million of debt due by AES IHB Cayman, Ltd., an affiliate of Tiete. Consequently AES Tiete Holdings, Ltd., Tietes parent company, entered into restructuring discussions with the certificate holders in August 2003. These negotiations were successfully concluded with the receipt of consents on December 15, 2003 from 100% of the certificate holders to restructure the certificates. The transaction closed on January 30, 2004. The restructuring, among other things, adjusted the repayment schedule, extended the final maturity date, changed the payment dates, eliminated the OPIC coverages, increased the debt service reserve account (related to which AES funded $15 million) and permitted the change of ownership of AES Tiete Holdings, Ltd. in order to effect the transfer related to the broader restructuring agreement with BNDES. Additionally, Energia Paulista Participa&ccedil;&otilde;es S.A., an indirect subsidiary of AES, has outstanding local non recourse debentures in the amount of $53 million, which were due on August 11, 2003. These debentures were issued to acquire 19% of Tietes preferred shares and are guaranteed by such shares. On August 7, 2003, approximately 91% of the debenture holders approved a change to certain terms and conditions of the debentures. The debentures are now due on August 11, 2005, interest on the debentures will be increased from 12% to 14% per annum but no interest payment will be made until August 11, 2004 and if no interest payment is made at that time the debenture holder will be entitled to convert the debentures held into the preferred shares used to secure the guarantee. The remaining 39 9% of debenture holders that did not accept the offer received shares in lieu of payment which reduced the Companys interest in the preferred shares from 19% to 17%. Sul. The efforts to restructure the debt at Sul and AES Cayman Guaiba, a subsidiary of the Company that owns the Companys interest in Sul, are in process and have been focused in the following areas: Successful restructuring of both the outstanding $71 million debenture agreement and the $10 million working capital loan (amounts based on December 31, 2003 exchange rate). The debenture agreement was amended to extend the amortization period to 5 annual principal payments and 20 quarterly interest payments for the first tranche and 5 annual interest payments for the second tranche ending in 2008. The working capital loan was amended to extend the amortization period from 12 to 36 monthly payments ending in 2006. Restructuring of the $300 million syndicated loan. The parties have entered into a non binding term sheet and continue to negotiate the final terms of the restructuring. The lenders have not extended any waivers for the outstanding defaults nor have they exercised their rights under the $50 million AES parent guarantee. There can be no assurances that the restructuring of this loan will be completed. Restructuring of an approximately $44 million outstanding payable to Itaipu for energy purchases from the Itaipu hydroelectric station. Sul is in discussions with Electrobas to amortize this liability in accordance with the global restructuring plan. Failure to restructure this liability before March 18, 2004 could have a negative impact on the tariff adjustment for 2004. While the discussions on amortization on this debt have been productive, there can be no assurances that the restructuring will be completed. Sul and AES Cayman Guaiba will continue to face shorter term debt maturities in 2004 and 2005 but, given that a bankruptcy proceeding would generally be an unattractive remedy for each of its lenders as it could result in an intervention by ANEEL or a termination of Suls concession, we think such an outcome is unlikely. However, we can not be assured that future negotiations will be successful and AES may have to write off some or all of the assets of Sul or AES Cayman Guaiba. The Companys total investment associated with Sul as of December 31, 2003 was approximately $266 million. Chile. On February 23, 2004 AES Gener S.A. ("Gener") announced details relating to the restructuring of Gener. Pursuant to the restructuring, which is expected to be completed by the end of April, the Company will settle an intercompany loan between our indirect subsidiary, Inversiones Cachagua Ltda. ("Cachagua"), and Gener (this part of the transaction was completed on February 27, 2004). The details of the restructuring are as follows: On March 12, 2004, Gener issued approximately $400 million of bonds in the international capital markets. In December 2003 and February 2004 in connection with the bond offering, Gener executed a series of treasury lock agreements to reduce its exposure to the underlying interest rate of the notes. These treasury lock agreements will not be reflected as cash flow hedges and as of March 10, 2004 were terminated by Gener. The fair market value of these transactions as of such date represented a loss of approximately $21.3 million before income taxes; We will sell a portion of the common shares of Gener owned by Cachagua in the Chilean and international equity markets; Gener will offer up to $125 million of new common shares to its shareholders; and Gener will repurchase up to $700 million of notes pursuant to three pending tender offers for each of Geners notes. 40 We cannot assure you that the Gener restructuring will be completed or that the terms thereof will not be changed materially. In addition, Gener is in the process of restructuring the debt of its subsidiaries, TermoAndes S.A. ("TermoAndes") and InterAndes, S.A. ("InterAndes"), and expects that the maturities of these obligations will be extended. Under performing Businesses During 2003 we sold or discontinued under performing businesses and construction projects that did not meet our investment criteria or did not provide reasonable opportunities to restructure. It is anticipated that there will be less ongoing activity related to write offs of development or construction projects and impairment charges in the future. The businesses, which were affected in 2003, are listed below. Project Name Project Type Date Location Impairment (in millions) Ede Este (1) Operating December 2003 Dominican Republic $ 60 Wolf Hollow Operating December 2003 United States $ 120 Granite Ridge Operating December 2003 United States $ 201 Colombia I Operating November 2003 Colombia $ 19 Zeg Construction December 2003 Poland $ 23 Bujagali Construction August 2003 Uganda $ 76 El Faro Construction April 2003 Honduras $ 20 (1)See Note 4 Discontinued Operations. Improving Credit Quality Our de leveraging efforts reduced parent level debt by $1.2 billion in 2003 (including the secured equity linked loan previously issued by AES New York Funding L.L.C.). We refinanced and paid down near term maturities by $3.5 billion and enhanced our year end liquidity to over $1 billion. Our average debt maturity was extended from 2009 to 2012. At the subsidiary level we continue to pursue limited recourse financing to reduce parent credit risk. These factors resulted in an overall reduced cost of capital, improved credit statistics and expanded access to credit at both AES and our subsidiaries. Liquidity at the AES parent level is an important factor for the rating agencies in determining whether the Companys credit quality should improve. Currency and political risk tend to be biggest variables to sustaining predictable cash flow. The nature of our large contractual and concession based cash flow from these businesses serves to mitigate these variables. In 2003, over 81% of cash distributions to the parent company were from U.S. large utilities and worldwide contract generation. On February 4, 2004, we called for redemption of $155,049,000 aggregate principal amount of outstanding 8% Senior Notes due 2008, which represents the entire outstanding principal amount of the 8% Senior Notes due 2008, and $34,174,000 aggregate principal amount of outstanding 10% secured Senior Notes due 2005. The 8% Senior Notes due 2008 and the 10% secured Senior Notes due 2005 were redeemed on March 8, 2004 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The mandatory redemption of the 10% secured Senior Notes due 2005 was being made with a portion of our "Adjusted Free Cash Flow" (as defined in the indenture pursuant to which the notes were issued) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 as required by the indenture and was made on a pro rata basis. On February 13, 2004 we issued $500 million of unsecured senior notes. The unsecured senior notes mature on March 1, 2014 and are callable at our option at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the unsecured senior notes plus a make whole premium. The unsecured senior notes were issued at a price of 98.288% and pay interest semi annually at an annual 41 coupon rate of 7.75%. We used the net proceeds of the offering to repay approximately $500 million of our term loan under our senior secured credit facilities. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the financial statements requires that management make subjective estimates, assumptions and judgments in applying these accounting policies. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and on assumptions about future events. Critical accounting estimates require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and a change in these estimates may have a material impact on the presentation of the Companys financial position or results of operations. The following critical accounting policies have and will have an impact on our business: Property, Plant, and Equipment. We record property, plant and equipment at cost and depreciate property, plant and equipment over its estimated useful life. We may be required to decrease the estimated useful life of our impacted generation facilities if we lose a long term contract at one of our contract generation businesses and cannot replace it or we experience a significant overabundance of supply and a sustained, significant decline in market prices in the regions served by our competitive supply businesses. We may also decrease the estimated useful life of our impacted distribution facilities if we lose a long term concession agreement at one of our growth distribution businesses or large utilities and cannot replace it. Additionally, we may decrease the estimated useful life of the affected property, plant and equipment if we incur significant physical damage or a significant mechanical failure. If we change the useful life of any of our property, plant and equipment, we plan to base the new life on engineering studies and our expected usage of the property, plant and equipment. The estimated remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment is approximately 28 years. If we were to decrease the estimated average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment by 5 years, our annual depreciation expense would increase by $159 million. A significant decrease in the estimated useful life of a material amount of property, plant and equipment could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the period in which the estimate is revised and in subsequent periods. Long Lived Assets. We assess long lived assets for impairment when indicators of impairment exist. We use estimates of future cash flows based on expected cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the assets to test the recoverability of specific long lived assets. We have $9.2 billion of long lived contract generation assets and our expected cash flows for businesses within the contract generation segment are based on the expected output of our generation facilities as well as the terms of our contractual agreements. We have $1.6 billion of long lived competitive supply assets and our expected cash flows for our businesses within the competitive supply segment are based on the expected output of the generation facilities as well as expected future market prices published on industry forward curves and other market price studies. We have $7.1 billion of large utility long lived assets and $1.6 billion of growth distribution long lived assets. We consider historical experience as well as future expectations and the expected future cash flows are based on expected future tariffs and expected future customer demand in order to determine expected cash flows for businesses within our large utilities and growth distribution segments. A significant reduction in actual cash flows and estimated cash flows may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. Regulatory Assets. At each reporting date, the Company reviews current regulatory trends in the markets in which it operates. This review involves judgment and is critical in assessing the recoverability of regulatory assets as well as the ability to continue to account for its activities based on the criteria set forth in SFAS No. 71 "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS 71). Based on the Companys current review, it believes its regulatory assets are probable of recovery. If all or part 42 of the Companys operations cease to meet the criteria of SFAS 71, a write off of related regulatory assets and liabilities could be required. We recorded deferred regulatory assets of $741 million, and $627 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively, that we expect to pass through to our customers in accordance with and subject to regulatory provisions. These amounts include $29 million and $105 million of assets classified as discontinued operations at December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively. We record the deferred regulatory assets at entities that are controlled and consolidated by us in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company would be required to determine any impairment to the carrying value of its utility plant and other regulated assets. In the event the regulator prevents us from including a material amount of capitalized costs in future tariffs and we therefore write off all or a portion of these assets, our operating results may be materially and negatively impacted. The table below illustrates the businesses that contain these regulatory assets (in millions): December 31, 2003 2002 BUSINESSES: Eletropaulo $ 629 $ 456 Sul 35 23 IPALCO (1) 48 44 Sub Total 712 523 DISCONTINUED BUSINESSES: CILCORP 11 Telasi 64 Ede Este 29 29 Sub Total 29 104 Total $ 741 $ 627 (1)In addition, IPALCO had deferred $153 million and $97 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of income tax costs to be considered in future regulatory proceedings. Functional Currency Determination. A businesss functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the business operates and is generally the currency in which the business generates and expends cash. If facts and circumstances require a change in the functional currency of a significant subsidiary, the change in functional currency could have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition. A change in the commercial contracts of a business which results in indexation of revenues and expenses to a currency other than the local currency of the business would require us to evaluate the appropriate functional currency for that respective business. Additionally, we would also be required to evaluate the appropriate functional currency for a respective business upon a significant change in the denomination of the financing and the availability of cash flows for remittance to the parent. Pension and Postretirement Obligations. Certain of our foreign and domestic subsidiaries maintain defined benefit pension plans, which we refer to as the pension plans, or the plans, covering substantially all of their respective employees. Pension benefits are generally based on years of credited service, age of the participant and average earnings. Of the thirteen pension plans existing at December 31, 2003, two exist at domestic subsidiaries and eleven exist at foreign subsidiaries. Two defined benefit pension plans constitute 95% of pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2003, 89% of the benefit obligation at December 31, 2003 and 87% of the fair value at December 31, 43 2003. One plan is a plan administered in the United States, which we refer to as the U.S. plan, and the other plan is administered in Brazil, which we refer to as the Brazilian plan. Of the remaining plans, no one plan represents a significant portion of the pension cost, benefit obligation or fair value at December 31, 2003. Pension cost for the U.S. plan is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 9% in 2003, 2002 and 2001. In developing our expected long term rate of return assumption, we evaluated input from our actuaries, including their review of asset class return expectations by several respected consultants and economists, as well as long term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants and economists are selected from within the "best estimate range," which is the smallest range which the actuary reasonably anticipates that the actual results, compounded over the measurement period, are more likely to fall than not. The best estimate of this range is based on asset class return expectations which reflect historical data as well as the opinion of several consultants and economists about the forecasted returns of each class. The best estimate range is a probability distribution of returns that spans the 25th to 75th percentiles of 20 year returns. We anticipate that our investment managers will continue to generate long term returns of at least 9%. We base our expected long term rate of return on plan assets on an asset allocation assumption of 45% U.S. equities, 10% non U.S. equities, 40% fixed income and 5% real estate which is equal to our actual asset allocation. We continue to believe that 9% is a reasonable long term rate of return on our plan assets. We continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust these assumptions as necessary. We determine the pension expense or income for the U.S. plan based on the fair value of assets on the measurement date. As of November 30, 2003, the U.S. plan has generated cumulative unrecognized net actuarial losses of approximately $88 million which we have not yet recognized as pension cost. These unrecognized net actuarial losses may result in decreases in future pension income depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions." The discount rate we use to determine future pension obligations for the U.S. plan is based upon the Aa rated annual yield as of the measurement date as published in the Moodys Daily Long term Corporate Bond Yields based on bonds with maturities of 20 years and above. Using this basis, we determined the discount rate to be 6.75% in 2003, 6.75% in 2002, and 7.25% in 2001. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets by 1% would have increased our 2003 pension cost by approximately $2.6 million. Lowering the discount rate by 100 basis points would increase our 2003 pension cost by approximately $2.7 million. The fair value of the U.S. plans assets has increased to $330 million at December 31, 2003 from $224 million at December 31, 2002. The investment performance returns and benefits paid during 2003 has decreased the underfunded position, net of benefit obligations, of the U.S. Plan from $187 million at December 31, 2002 to $113 million at December 31, 2003. We began to report the Brazilian plan on a consolidated basis when we acquired an additional ownership interest in Eletropaulo in February 2002. We calculate the pension cost for the Brazilian plan based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 14% in 2003. In developing our expected long term rate of return assumption, we evaluated input from our actuaries, including their review of asset class return expectations which are based on studies of historical data series as well as the opinion of several respected consultants and economists about forecasts, long term inflation assumptions, dollar spot assumptions and local interest rate assumptions. We based each asset class return expectation upon historical returns for assets with similar maturities and risk. We anticipate that our investment managers will continue to generate long term returns of at least 12%. Over the past seven years, the Brazilian plan has had actual returns 44 of 18%. Our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 76% fixed income investments, 20% equities and 4% real estate. Our assumed asset allocation uses a lower exposure to equities to more closely match market conditions and near term forecasts. We will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust as necessary. We base our determination of the Brazilian plan pension expense or income on the fair value of assets on the measurement date. As of December 31, 2003, the Brazilian plan has generated cumulative unrecognized net actuarial losses of approximately $461 million which we have not yet recognized as pension cost. These unrecognized net actuarial losses result in decreases in future pension income depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions." We use a discount rate based on long term annuity contracts to determine future pension obligations for the Brazilian plan since there is no active corporate bond market in Brazil. On this basis, we determined the discount rate to be 12% for 2003. If we lowered the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by 1.0%, our 2003 pension cost would have increased by approximately $8.0 million. If we lowered the discount rate by 100 basis points, our 2003 pension cost would increase by approximately $22.8 million. The fair value of the Brazilian plan assets is $980 million at December 31, 2003. The Brazilian plan has an underfunded position, net of benefit obligations, of $1,114 million at December 31, 2003. Annually, we review all pension plans to determine if the plans accumulated benefit obligations exceed the fair value of the plans assets. If the accumulated benefit obligations exceed the fair value of plan assets, we record an additional minimum pension liability on the balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive income. We may incur additional minimum pension liabilities in future periods and they could be material. On an ongoing basis, the Companys evaluates its estimates, including those related to the value of goodwill and intangible assets, inventories, bad debts, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. The Companys estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. New Accounting Pronouncements Variable Interest Entities. On December 24, 2003 the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46(R)"). FIN 46(R) partially deferred the effective date of FIN 46 for certain entities, and makes several other major changes to FIN 46 which include, an improved definition of variable interest, and an exemption for many entities defined as businesses in the Interpretation. FIN 46(R) also eliminated bias against decision maker fees and certain guarantee fees which were previously treated as variable interests in a variable interest entity, the effect of which is that decision makers and certain guarantors are less likely to become primary beneficiaries. The Company applied FIN 46 in its financial statements relating to its interest in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities as of December 31, 2003. The Company is required to apply FIN 46(R) for all other types of entities in its financial statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2004. The effects FIN 46(R) will have on results of operations and financial position are currently being evaluated. The Company does not believe that the adoption and application of FIN 46(R) will result in the consolidation of any previously unconsolidated entities or material additional disclosure. Application of FIN 46(R) may cause the Company to discontinue consolidation of certain subsidiaries. 45  Results of Operations Revenues Overview Revenues increased approximately $1.0 billion, or 14%, to $8.4 billion in 2003 from $7.4 billion in 2002. The increase in revenues is due to new operations from greenfield projects and improvements from existing operations. Excluding businesses that commenced commercial operations in 2003 or 2002, revenues increased 8% to $8.0 billion in 2003. Revenues increased approximately $1.1 billion, or 16%, to $7.4 billion in 2002 from $6.3 billion in 2001. The increase in revenues is due to the acquisition of new businesses and new operations from greenfield projects. Excluding businesses that we acquired or that commenced commercial operations in 2002 or 2001, revenues decreased 19% to $4.9 billion in 2002. Regulated Revenues Regulated revenues increased 10% or $409 million, to $4.4 billion in 2003 compared to 2002. This increase is the result of a $151 million increase in our large utilities segment, and a $258 million increase in growth distribution segment. We did not acquire or commence operations of any business in 2003 or 2002 that had an impact on our regulated revenues. Regulated revenues increased 39% or $1.1 billion, to $4 billion in 2002 compared to 2001. This increase is the result of $1.5 billion increase in our large utilities segment, which is offset by a $378 million reduction in our growth distribution segment. Excluding businesses acquired or that commenced operation in 2002 or 2001, regulated revenues decreased 29% to $2.0 billion during 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Year to Date Amount % of Total Revenues Year to Date Amount % of Total Revenues Year to Date Amount % of Total Revenues (in $millions) Large Utilities: North America $ 832 10% $ 818 11% $ 836 13% South America 1,861 22% 1,698 23% Caribbean* 608 8% 634 9% 805 13% Total Large Utilities $ 3,301 40% $ 3,150 43% $ 1,641 26% Growth Distribution: South America $ 415 5% $ 263 4% $ 781 12% Caribbean* 343 4% 311 4% 321 5% Europe/Africa 368 4% 294 4% 144 2% Total Growth Distribution $ 1,126 13% $ 868 12% $ 1,246 20% Total Regulated Revenues $ 4,427 53% $ 4,018 54% $ 2,887 46% *Includes Venezuela 46 Large Utilities The increase in large utility segment revenue in 2003 of $151 million is primarily due to the consolidation of Eletropaulo for a full fiscal year compared to 11 months in 2002, where revenues increased $163 million compared to 2002. Total sales volume at Eletropualo increased year over year by approximately 1%, although this was more than offset by a decline in the average customer tariff in 2003 resulting from a decrease in residential consumption. This net increase at Eletropaulo as well as an increase of 2% ($14 million) in revenues at IPALCO, were partially offset by a 4% ($26 million) decline in revenues at EDC. The large utility segment revenue increase in 2002 is due to the consolidation of Eletropaulo in Brazil, which is partially offset by an $18 million decrease at IPALCO and a $171 million decrease at EDC compared to 2001. Lower revenues at IPALCO resulted from lower wholesale electricity prices in 2002. The decline at EDC was primarily caused by the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar during the year. We began consolidating Eletropaulo in February 2002 when we obtained control of the business. Please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of the Eletropaulo swap transaction. If Eletropaulo had been consolidated during the comparable period in 2001, revenues compared to the prior period would have been lower due to electricity rationing in Brazil in early 2002. Although rationing ended in February 2002 customer demand did not return to the level it was prior to rationing. Growth Distribution Revenue from the growth distribution segment in 2003 increased $258 million as compared to 2002. The most significant component of the increase was due to the impact of the $146 million provision recorded at Sul in 2002 discussed below. The most significant additional contributions to the 2003 increase included an increase of $57 million at Sonel in Cameroon resulting from higher customer tariffs in 2003 and increased sales volumes, an increase of $30 million in our El Salvador distribution businesses because of higher sales volumes and increased tariffs and an increase in our Argentine distribution businesses primarily arising from the appreciation of the Argentine peso in 2003. Revenue from the growth distribution segment decreased $378 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due to the economic and regulatory impacts of the devaluation of the Argentine peso at Eden, Edes and Edelap where aggregate revenues decreased $228 million. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2002, ANEEL, the Brazilian electricity regulator, announced an order to retroactively change the calculation methods of the Wholesale Energy Markets ("MAE"). As a result the Company recorded a provision for the Brazilian regulatory decision at Sul of approximately $146 million against revenues. Increases in Europe/Africa are primarily due to the acquisitions of Sonel and Kievoblenergo and Rivnooblenergo in the Ukraine. Non Regulated Revenues Non regulated revenues increased 19%, or $626 million, to $4.0 billion in 2003 compared to 2002. This increase is the result of a $558 million increase in our contract generation segment, and a $68 million increase in our competitive supply segment. Excluding businesses that commenced operations in 2003 or 2002, non regulated revenues increased 6% to $3.5 billion in 2003. Non regulated revenues decreased 1%, or $50 million, to $3.4 billion in 2002 compared to 2001. This decrease is the result of a $22 million decrease in our contract generation segment, and a $28 million 47 decrease in our competitive supply segment. Excluding businesses acquired or that commenced operations in 2002 or 2001, non regulated revenues decreased 11% to $3.0 billion in 2002.

Together, these businesses contributed $407 million, or 73%, of the increase for 2003. Revenues also improved over the same time period at Los Mina in the Domincan Republic, Merida III in Mexico, Tisza in Hungary, Gener in Chile, and Tiete in Brazil. These improvements were offset by declines at Shady Point in Oklahoma, due to a scheduled decrease in the contracted capacity payment, and at Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan, because of lower energy dispatch in 2003. Revenue from our contract generation segment for 2002 decreased $22 million from 2001 due to declines at Southland in California, the Gener plants in Chile, Tiete and Uruguaiana in Brazil, Los Mina in the Dominican Republic, and Merida III in Mexico. The reductions at these businesses were offset, in part by improvements resulting from the start of operations at Ironwood in Pennsylvania and Red Oak in New Jersey during 2002, as well as increased revenues from Warrior Run in Maryland, the acquisition of Mendota in California, Hemphill in New Hampshire, Ebute in Nigeria and Bohemia in the Czech Republic. Competitive Supply Revenue from our competitive supply segment for 2003 increased $68 million over 2002 due primarily to an increase of $54 million in the revenues at our New York plants, where average competitive market prices for electricity sold by those plants increased approximately 29% over 2002. The remaining net increase resulted from improvements at several other plants including Alicura and 48 Parana in Argentina, Panama in the Caribbean and Ekibastuz in Asia. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from Deepwater in Texas due to an extended outage in 2003 and the termination of a small retail electricity business in the U.K. in early 2003. Revenue from our competitive supply segment for 2002 decreased $28 million over 2001 due to a reduction in average competitive market prices in New York of approximately 11% during the year,as well as a decline in demand in California due to mild weather. Revenues decreased additionally due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso in February 2002. These declines were offset slightly by the completion of construction and the start of operations at Parana in Argentina and the acquisition of Ottana in Italy. Gross Margin Overview Gross margin increased $483 million, or 25%, to $2.4 billion in 2003 from $2.0 billion in 2002. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 29% in 2003 from 26% in 2002. The increase is primarily due to new operations from greenfield projects. Excluding businesses that commenced commercial operations in 2003 or 2002, gross margin increased 16% to $2.2 billion in 2003. We expect that our gross margin will be negatively impacted in future periods by the expensing of stock options and other long term incentive compensation. Gross margin decreased less than $50 million, or less than 3%, to approximately $2.0 billion in 2002 compared to 2001. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 26% in 2002 from 32% in 2001. The decrease in gross margin is due to lower market prices in the United States and was partially offset by the acquisition of new businesses and new operations from greenfield projects. Excluding businesses acquired or that commenced commercial operations in 2002 or 2001, gross margin decreased 23% to $1.6 billion in 2002. Regulated Gross Margin Regulated gross margin increased 35% or $244 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase is due to a $75 million increase in our large utilities segment, and $169 million increase in our growth distribution segment. Regulated gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 21% in 2003 from 17% in 2002. Excluding businesses that commenced operations in 2003 or 2002, regulated gross margin increased 35% to $946 million in 2003. Regulated gross margin decreased 22% or $201 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease is primarily due to weakening margins in our South American growth distribution businesses and our Caribbean large utility business offset by increases at our North and South American large utilities and Europe/Africa growth distribution businesses. Regulated gross margin as a percentage of revenues 49 decreased to 17% in 2002 from 31% in 2001. Excluding businesses acquired or that commenced operations in 2002 or 2001, regulated gross margin decreased 54% to $427 million in 2002.

EDCs gross margin increased due to higher demand and increased tariffs in 2003 compared to 2002. IPALCO experienced a lower margin and margin percentage due to milder weather and higher operating and maintenance cost in 2003. The large utilities segment gross margin as a percentage of large utility segment revenue increased to 23% for 2003 from 22% in 2002. Gross margin from our large utilities segment increased in 2002 due to increases in North and South America offset in part by a decrease in the Caribbean. North America increased due to increased contributions from IPALCO. South America increased due to the consolidation of Eletropaulo. The decrease in the Caribbean is due to the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar and its impacts on EDC. EDCs tariff is adjusted semi annually to reflect fluctuations in inflation and the currency exchange rate. However, a failure to receive such an adjustment to reflect changes in the exchange rate and inflation could adversely affect their results of operations in the future. The large utilities gross margin as a percentage of large utility segment revenues decreased to 22% for 2002 from 37% in 2001. Eletropaulos 2002 gross margin was negatively impacted by the write off of approximately $80 million of other receivables. Our distribution concession contracts in Brazil provide for annual tariff adjustments based upon changes in the local inflation rates and, generally, significant devaluations are followed by increased local currency inflation. However, because of the lack of adjustment to the current exchange rate, the in arrears nature of the respective tariff adjustment, or the potential delays or magnitude of the resulting local currency inflation of the tariff, the future results of operations of Eletropaulo could be adversely affected by the continued devaluation of the Brazilian Real. 50 Growth Distribution Gross margin from our growth distribution segment increased in 2003 due to increases at Sonel in Cameroon and Caess in El Salvador. Additionally, there was a nonrecurring charge taken in 2002 for the write off of $141 million related to MAE settlements at Sul in Brazil that did not occur in 2003. These increases were partially offset by decreased gross margins at Eden, Edes and Edelap in Argentina. The growth distribution gross margin as a percentage of growth distribution segment revenues increased to 16% in 2003 from 2% in 2002. Gross margin from our growth distribution segment decreased in 2002 due to a decline of $310 million in South America gross margin, which was offset in part by increases in Europe/Africa and the Caribbean, respectively. South America gross margin declined primarily due to devaluation of the Argentine peso and the reduction in gross margin from Sul due to the $146 million provision for the Brazilian regulatory decision. Europe/Africa gross margin increased due to the acquisitions of Kievoblenergo and Rivnooblenergo in the Ukraine. The growth distribution gross margin as a percentage of growth distribution segment revenues decreased to 2% in 2002 from 23% in 2001. Non Regulated Gross Margin Non regulated gross margin increased 16% or $239 million in 2003 compared to 2002. This increase is due to a $37 million increase in our competitive supply segment, and a $202 million increase in our contract generation segment. Non regulated gross margin as a percentage of revenues remained relatively constant at 37% in 2003 and in 2002. Excluding businesses that commenced operations in 2003 or 2002, non regulated gross margin increased 6% to $1.3 billion in 2003. Non regulated gross margin increased 12% or $151 million in 2002 compared to 2001. This increase is due to a $172 million increase in our contract generation segment, which is offset by a $24 million decrease in our competitive supply segment. Non regulated gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 37% in 2002 from 32% in 2001. Excluding businesses acquired or that commenced operations in 2002 or 2001, non regulated gross margin increased 4% to $1.1 billion in 2002. 51  December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Year to Date Amount Operating Gross Margin % Year to Date Amount Operating Gross Margin % Year to Date Amount Operating Gross Margin % (in $millions) Contract Generation: North America $ 415 47% $ 426 50% $ 394 48% South America 387 42% 318 37% 290 32% Caribbean* 128 26% 32 18% 27 13% Europe/Africa 141 34% 147 40% 94 28% Asia 196 49% 142 47% 88 29% Total Contract Generation $ 1,267 41% $ 1,065 42% $ 893 35% Competitive Supply: North America $ 113 25% $ 96 23% $ 109 26% South America 43 39% 19 26% 40 26% Caribbean* 37 44% 32 46% 23 32% Europe/Africa 2 2% 17 10% 17 16% Asia 25 24% 19 21% 15 18% Total Competitive Supply $ 220 25% $ 183 23% $ 204 25% Total Non Regulated Revenues $ 1,487 37% $ 1,248 37% $ 1,097 32% *Includes Venezuela Contract Generation Gross margin from our contract generation segment increased in 2003 because of improvements at Tiete in Brazil, and Ebute in Nigeria compared to 2002. Additionally, new plants came online and contributed to the increase. These new plants include Red Oak in New Jersey, Puerto Rico L.P. in Puerto Rico, Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka, Barka in Oman, Ras Laffan in Qatar and Andres in the Dominican Republic. These increases were partially offset by declines in gross margin at Beaver Valley and Ironwood in Pennsylvania, Shady Point in Oklahoma, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and the Chigen plants in China. The contract generation gross margin as a percentage of contract generation revenues slightly decreased to 41% in 2003 from 42% in 2001. Gross margin from our contract generation segment increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to improvements at existing businesses and operations from new businesses. The contract generation gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 42% in 2002 from 35% in 2001. Gross margin increased in all geographic regions. North America gross margin increased due to the start of commercial operations at Ironwood in Pennsylvania, Red Oak in New Jersey and improvements at Warrior Run in Maryland and Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania. South America gross margin increased due to increases at Gener, Tiete and Uruguaiana. Europe/Africa gross margin increased $53 million mainly due to the acquisition of Ebute in Nigeria and improvements at Kilroot in Northern Ireland and Tisza II in Hungary. Asia gross margin increased due to increased contributions from Jiaozuo and Hefei in China. Competitive Supply Gross margin from our competitive supply segment increased in 2003 due to improvements at the NY Plants, CTSN and Parana in South America and Altai in Asia. These increases were partially offset by lower margins and margin percentages at Deepwater in Texas and Borsod in Europe/Africa. The 52 competitive supply gross margin as a percentage of competitive supply revenues increased to 25% in 2003 from 23% in 2002. Gross margin from our competitive supply segment decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to reductions in North America, South America, Europe and Africa gross margins that were offset slightly by increases from the Caribbean and Asia. North America gross margin decreased mainly due to the lower energy prices in New York and milder weather in California. South America gross margin decreased mainly due to the devaluation of the peso in Argentina. Caribbean gross margin increased due to increases from Panama and Chivor in Colombia. The competitive supply gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 23% in 2002 from 25% in 2001. Corporate and business development office expenses Corporate and business development office expense increased $45 million, or 29%, to $157 million in 2003 from $112 million in 2002. Corporate and business development office expense as a percentage of total revenues remained approximately 2% in 2003 and in 2002. The increase in dollar amounts is a result of additional personnel, infrastructure and consulting associated with the implementation of several corporate initiatives, new government compliance regulations, expensing of stock options and other long term incentive compensation. Corporate and business development expense decreased $8 million, or 7%, to $112 million in 2002 from $120 million in 2001. Corporate and business development expense as a percentage of total revenues remained approximately 2% in 2002 and in 2001. The overall decrease in corporate and business development expense was due to the Companys increased focus on cost cutting. Severance and transaction costs During 2001, the Company incurred approximately $131 million of transaction and contractual severance costs related to the acquisition of IPALCO. Interest expense Interest expense increased $242 million, or 24%, to $2 billion in 2003 from $1.7 billion in 2002. Interest expense as a percentage of revenues was 24% in 2003 and 24% in 2002. Eletropaulo accrued $194 million of interest expense regarding their defaulted debts in 2003, which comprises 80% of the increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 over the year ended December 31, 2002. In December 2003, we reached an agreement with BNDES and BNDESPAR to restructure those defaulted debts through a partial ownership of a new company, which will hold our direct and indirect interests in Eletropaulo, Uruguaiana and Tiete, and a payable which will be paid over an eleven year period. Also, during December 2002, we refinanced a significant amount of debt with debt containing less favorable terms than those in the original debt. Of this debt $852 million was retired in 2003, and approximately $500 million during the first quarter of 2004. In 2003, several projects were abandoned and all capitalized interest related to those projects was written off. Interest expense increased $417 million, or 31%, to $1.7 billion in 2002 from $1.3 billion in 2001. Interest expense as a percentage of revenues was 24% in 2002 and 21% in 2001. Overall interest expense increased primarily due to the consolidation of Eletropaulo in February 2002, issuance of senior secured notes at IPALCO, interest expense from new businesses, as well as additional corporate interest costs arising from a higher outstanding balance during 2002 on our revolving loan. Interest income Interest income increased $21 million, or 8%, to $280 million in 2003 from $259 million in 2002. Interest income as a percentage of revenues was 3% in 2003, and 4% in 2002. The increase in interest 53 income during 2003 is due primarily to a $58 million increase in interest earnings in Eletropaulo related to its regulatory asset and accounts receivable. We consolidated Eletropaulo in February 2002, therefore the results for 2003 included 12 months compared to 11 months in 2002. The increase in Eletropaulo in 2003 over 2002 was partially offset by a general decline in interest earnings due to a decline in the interest rates. Interest income increased $100 million, or 63%, to $259 million in 2002 from $159 million in 2001. Interest income as a percentage of revenues was 4% in 2002, and 3% in 2001. The increase in interest income during 2002 is due primarily to the consolidation of Eletropaulo partially offset by a decline in interest income from Thames, in the U.S., due to the collection of its contract receivable. Other income Other income increased $38 million, or 29%, to $171 million in 2003 from $133 million in 2002. Approximately $141 million of other income recorded in 2003 is attributable to gains on the extinguishment of liabilities. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for an analysis of other income. Other income increased $20 million, or 18%, to $133 million in 2002 from $113 million in 2001. Approximately $90 million of the amount recorded in 2002 is attributable to gains on the extinguishment of liabilities and mark to market gains on commodity derivatives. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of other income. Other expense Other expense increased $27 million, or 31%, to $110 million in 2003 from $83 million in 2002. Approximately $57 million of other expense recorded in 2003 is attributable to mark to market loss on commodity derivatives and debt refinancing costs. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of other expense. Other expense increased $22 million, or 36%, to $83 million in 2002 from $61 million in 2001. Approximately $76 million of the amount recorded in 2002 is attributable to losses on the extinguishment of liabilities and other non operating expenses. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of other expense. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) Foreign currency transaction gains increased $586 million to $127 million in 2003 from a loss of $459 million in 2002. Foreign currency transaction gains increased primarily due to an appreciation of the Brazil Real during 2003 from 3.53 at December 31, 2002 to 2.89 at December 31, 2003. This appreciation resulted in a gain of approximately $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Additionally, the Argentine peso appreciated from 3.32 at December 31, 2002 to 2.93 at December 31, 2003. This appreciation resulted in approximately $37 million of foreign currency transaction gains for the year ended December 31, 2003. These gains were offset by $12 million of foreign currency transaction losses recorded at EDC during 2003 due to a 12% devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar from 1,403 at December 31, 2002 to 1,600 at December 31, 2003. EDC uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency but a portion of its debt is denominated in the Venezuelan Bolivar. Foreign currency transaction losses increased $447 million to $459 million in 2002 from $12 million in 2001. Foreign currency transaction losses increased primarily due to 50% devaluation in the Argentine peso from 1.65 at December 31, 2001 to 3.32 at December 31, 2002, which resulted in $143 million of foreign currency transaction losses for the year ended December 31, 2002. Additionally, 32% devaluation occurred in the Brazilian Real during 2002 from 2.41 at December 31, 2001 to 3.53 at December 31, 2002. Furthermore, we recorded more foreign currency losses due to the consolidation of 54 Eletropaulo, and since there was less allocation to the minority partners because their investment has been reduced to zero. As a result, we recorded net Brazilian foreign currency losses of $357 million during 2002, of which approximately $83 million is included in equity in pre tax (losses) earnings of affiliates. These decreases were offset by $39 million of foreign currency transaction gains recorded at EDC during 2002 due to a 46% devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar from 758 at December 31, 2001 to 1,403 at December 31, 2002. EDC uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency but a portion of its debt is denominated in the Venezuelan Bolivar. Equity in (losses) earnings of affiliates Equity in (losses) earnings of affiliates increased by $297 million to income of $94 million in 2003 compared to a loss of $203 million in 2002. The overall increase is due primarily to the change of control in February 2002 of Eletropaulo, and an impairment charge taken for an other than temporary decline in value at CEMIG in 2002. Equity in earnings of contract generation affiliated increased to $94 million in 2003 from $75 million in 2002. The increase is due to improvements from Chigen and OPGC in Asia, Elsta in Europe/Africa, and income realized from the gain on the sale of our ownership interest in Medway Power Ltd. Equity in (losses) earnings of affiliates declined by $378 million to a loss of $203 million in 2002 compared to income of $175 million in 2001. The overall decrease is primarily due to declines in equity in earnings of Brazilian large utility affiliates, including the impairment charge associated with the other than temporary decline in value of CEMIG in 2002. Additionally, a share swap was completed during February 2002, which gave us control of Eletropaulo. In 2001, the Company recorded $134 million of equity in Eletropaulos earnings; however, this amount decreased to $18 million due to consolidation of Eletropaulos results subsequent to the share swap and the ongoing devaluation of the Brazilian Real. Equity in (losses) earnings of our large utilities included non cash Brazilian foreign currency transaction losses of $83 million and $210 million during 2002 and 2001, respectively, due to the devaluation of the Brazilian Real during both periods. Equity in (losses) earnings of growth distribution affiliates improved from a loss of $14 million in 2001 to $0 in 2002. The improvement is primarily due to a change in accounting for our investment in CESCO, a distribution facility in India. Equity in earnings of contract generation affiliates increased to $75 million in 2002 from $54 million in 2001. The increase is due primarily to contributions from several Chinese equity affiliates and from Elsta offset by a decrease from OPGC. Equity in earnings of competitive supply affiliates improved from a loss of $9 million in 2001 to a loss of $3 million in 2002. The improvement is primarily due to the sale of Infovias, a Brazilian company, during the second quarter of 2002. (Loss) gain on sale of investments and asset impairment expense Loss on sale of investments and asset impairment expense decreased to a loss of $201 million in 2003 compared to a loss of $473 million in 2002 primarily from fewer impairment charges being taken in 2003. In December 2003, we sold an approximate 39% ownership interest in AES Oasis Limited ("AES Oasis") for cash proceeds of approximately $150 million. The loss realized on the transaction was approximately $36 million before income taxes. AES Oasis is an entity that owns an electric generation project in Oman (AES Barka) and two oil fired generating facilities in Pakistan (AES Lal Pir and AES Pak Gen). AES Barka, AES Lal Pir, and AES Pak Gen are all contract generation businesses. 55 During the fourth quarter of 2003, we decided to discontinue the development of Zeg, a contract generation plant under construction in Poland. In connection with this decision, we wrote off our investment in Zeg of approximately $23 million before income taxes. On August 8, 2003, we decided to discontinue the construction and development of AES Nile Power in Uganda ("Bujagali"). In connection with this decision, we wrote off our investment in Bujagali of approximately $76 million before income taxes in the third quarter of 2003. We are also working in conjunction with the Government of Uganda, the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation ("IFC") to evaluate ways to ensure an orderly transition for the project to continue without our participation. In 1999 we initiated a development project in Honduras which consisted of a 580 MW combined cycle power plant fueled by natural gas; a liquefied natural gas import terminal with storage capacity of one million barrels; and transmission lines and line upgrades (together "El Faro" or "the Project"). During April 2003, after consideration of existing business conditions and future opportunities, we elected to offer the Project for sale. While discussions have been ongoing, no formal agreements have been reached thus far. Upon review of the current circumstances surrounding the Project, we believe that, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,the Project is deemed to be impaired since the carrying amount of our investment in the Project exceeds its fair value. As a result during the second quarter of 2003, we wrote off capitalized costs of approximately $20 million associated with the Project. See Note 23 Subsequent Events. Additionally, during 2003, we recorded $16 million of other losses which resulted from the sale of assets to third parties, and $29 million of other asset impairment charges taken to reflect the net realizable value of discontinued development projects and other non recoverable assets. (Loss) gain on sale of investments and asset impairment expense changed from a gain of $18 million for 2001 to a loss of $473 million in 2002 primarily resulting from impairment charges taken in 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we decided not to provide any further funding to Lake Worth and to sell the project. Subsequently the project entered into bankruptcy. As a result, the carrying amount of AESs investment in the Lake Worth project is not expected to be recovered. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, a pre tax impairment charge of $78 million was recorded to write down the net assets of Lake Worth to their fair market value. In September 2002, AES Greystone, L.L.C. and its subsidiary Haywood Power I, L.L.C., sold the Greystone gas fired peaker assets then under construction in Tennessee to Tenaska Power Equipment for $36 million including cash and assumption of certain obligations. With this sale, AES and its subsidiaries have eliminated any future capital expenditures related to the facility, and also settled all major outstanding obligations with parties involved in this project. We recorded a loss of approximately $168 million associated with this sale. Greystone was previously recorded as a competitive supply business. Additionally, during 2002, we recorded $116 million of other losses which resulted from the sale of assets to third parties, and $111 million of other asset impairment charges taken to reflect the net realizable value of discontinued development projects and other non recoverable assets. Goodwill impairment expense During 2003, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $11 million primarily related to all of the goodwill at Atlantis in the Caribbean. We recognize the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our annual 56 impairment testing date is October 1st. As of January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized in accordance with SFAS 142. During 2002, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $612 million primarily related to all of the goodwill at Eletropaulo in Brazil. We recognize the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our annual impairment testing date is October 1st. Prior to January 1, 2002, we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over the estimated benefit period, which ranged from 10 to 40 years. Total accumulated amortization amounted to $190 million at December 31, 2001. Income taxes Income tax expense (including income taxes on equity in earnings and minority interest) on continuing operations decreased from $285 million in 2002 to $194 million in 2003. The effective tax rate decreased from (21)% in 2002 (we had a tax expense on a loss from continuing operations) to 30% in 2003. The reduction in the 2003 effective tax rate is due, in part, to a reduction in the taxes on our foreign earnings. In addition, the 2002 effective tax rate is not in line with our historic effective tax rate trend as it was the result of significant book write offs that were not deductible for tax purposes. The 2002 income tax expense (including income taxes on equity in earnings and minority interest) on continuing operations decreased to $285 million from $310 million in 2001. The 2002 effective tax rate increased to (21)% (we had a tax expense on a loss from continuing operations) from 38% in 2001. The reason for this increase was primarily the result of significant book write offs that were not deductible for tax purposes. Discontinued operations Loss from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax, were $780 million in 2003 and $1,554 million in 2002. During 2003, we discontinued certain of our operations including Haripur, Meghnaghat, Barry, Telasi, Mtkvari, Khrami, Drax, Whitefield, AES Communications Bolivia, Granite Ridge, Ede Este, Wolf Hollow and Colombia I. We closed the sale of Barry in September 2003, Telasi, Mtkvari and Khrami in August 2003 and Haripur and Meghnaghat in December 2003. Loss from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax, were $1,554 million and $133 million, respectively, in 2002 and 2001. During 2002, we discontinued certain of our operations including Fifoots, CILCORP, NewEnergy, Eletronet, Mt. Stuart, Ecogen, two Altai businesses, Mountainview and Kelvin. We closed the sale of both CILCORP and Mt. Stuart in January 2003 and the sale of Ecogen in February 2003. During 2001, we discontinued certain of its operations, including Power Direct, Ib Valley, Power Northern, Geoutilities, TermoCandelaria and several telecommunications businesses in the United States and Brazil. All of the operations for these businesses and the related write offs from dispositions in 2002 and 2001 are reported in this line item. Change in accounting principle On October 1, 2003, we adopted Derivative Implementation Group ("DIG") Issue C 20 which superceded and clarified DIG Issue C 11 regarding the treatment of power sales contracts. As a result of this adoption, we had a Power Purchase Agreement ("PPA") that was previously treated as a "normal sales and purchase contract" that is now being recorded prospectively at fair value; and treated as a derivative instrument under SFAS No. 133. The prospective method of accounting for this PPA requires no further mark to market treatment, and will be subsequently amortized over the life of 57 the contract. The adoption of DIG Issue C 20, effective October 1, 2003 results in a cumulative increase to income of $43 million, net of income tax effects. On January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" which requires companies to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. The items that are part of the scope of SFAS 143 for our business primarily include active ash landfills, water treatment basins and the removal or dismantlement of certain plant and equipment. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in a cumulative reduction to income of $2 million, net of income tax effects. On April 1, 2002, we adopted Derivative Implementation Group ("DIG") Issue C 15 which established specific guidelines for certain contracts to be considered normal purchases and normal sales contracts under SFAS No. 133. As a result of this adoption, we had two contracts which no longer qualified as normal purchases and normal sales contracts and were required to be treated as derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133. The adoption of DIG Issue C 15, effective April 1, 2002, resulted in a cumulative increase to income of $127 million, net of income tax effects. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" which establishes accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 resulted in a cumulative reduction to income of $473 million, net of income tax effects. SFAS No. 142 adopts a fair value model for evaluating impairment of goodwill in place of the recoverability model used previously. We wrote off the goodwill associated with certain acquisitions where the current fair market value of such businesses is less than the current carrying value of the business, primarily as a result of reductions in fair value associated with lower than expected growth in electricity consumption compared to the original estimates made at the date of acquisition. Our annual impairment testing date is October 1st. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Overview We are a holding company that conducts all of our operations through subsidiaries. We have, to the extent achievable, utilized non recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies and related assets. This type of financing is non recourse to other subsidiaries and affiliates and to us (as parent company), and is generally secured by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of the related subsidiary or affiliate. At December 31, 2003, we had $5.9 billion of recourse debt and $13.7 billion of non recourse debt outstanding. For more information on our long term debt see Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements. In addition to the non recourse debt, if available, we, as the parent company, provide a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition. These investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or loans, which are subordinated to the projects non recourse loans. We generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations and or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. Similarly, in certain of our businesses, we may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counter parties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity with our subsidiaries. In such circumstances, if a subsidiary defaults on its payment or supply obligation, we will be responsible for the subsidiarys obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. We intend to continue to seek where possible non recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that our affiliates or we may develop, construct or acquire. However, depending on market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non recourse debt may not be 58 available or available on economically attractive terms. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary that is under construction or has near term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent and we may lose our investment in such subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to restructure the non recourse debt financing. If such subsidiary is unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non recourse debt, we may lose our investment in such subsidiary. As a result of our below investment grade rating of the parent, counter parties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, we may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. We may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counter parties. In addition, to the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counter parties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. At December 31, 2003, we had provided outstanding financial and performance related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our subsidiaries, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, in an aggregate of approximately $515 million (excluding those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below). We also are obligated under other commitments pursuant to which our obligations are limited to the amount, or a specified percentage of the amount, of distributions that we receive from our projects subsidiaries. In addition, we have commitments of $38 million to fund our equity in projects currently under development or in construction. At December 31, 2003, we had $89 million in letters of credit outstanding, which operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and subsidiary operations. Of these letters of credit, $70 million were provided under our revolver. We pay letter of credit fees ranging from 0.5% to 5.0% per annum on the outstanding amounts. In addition, we had $4 million in surety bonds outstanding at December 31, 2003. Financial Position and Cash Flows At December 31, 2003, we had a consolidated net working capital deficit of $1.6 billion compared to a net working capital deficit of $2.1 billion at the end of 2002. The improvement in net working capital is due to increased cash, increased net accounts receivable and reduced current portion of long term debt. This is partially offset by a decrease in other current assets and the current assets of discontinued operations, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued interest. We had unrestricted cash and short term investments of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2003. Included in the net working capital deficit is approximately $2.8 billion from the current portion of long term debt, of which $2.3 billion is due to project level defaults. We expect to refinance a significant amount of the current portion of long term debt in 2004. We can provide no guarantee that the refinanced debt will have terms as favorable as our debt currently in existence. Some of our subsidiaries issue short term debt and commercial paper in the normal course of business and continually refinance these obligations. Property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, accounts for 62% of our total assets and was $18.5 billion at December 31, 2003. Net property, plant and equipment increased $1 billion, or 6%, during 2003. The increase was due primarily to construction activity during 2003. We continuously monitor actual and potential changes to environmental regulations and plans for the associated costs. As a result, we expect to spend approximately $94 million in 2004 to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to raise our level of preparedness for future regulations that may be enacted. However, changes in environmental laws may require us to incur significant expenses that could exceed our estimates. We expect to obtain third party financing for a portion of these capital expenditures. In 2004 we plan to make capital expenditures for construction costs associated with new 59 environmental standards imposed by the EPA relating to NOx emission reductions, the installation of low NOx burners, additional monitoring equipment, and other environmental related projects. In total, our consolidated debt decreased by $464 million, or 2%, to $19.6 billion at December 31, 2003. The decrease is primarily due to scheduled amortization payments, optional debt redemptions, and the sale of certain businesses and the reclassification of certain businesses to discontinued operations. At December 31, 2003, we had $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents representing an increase of $945 million from December 31, 2002. The $1.6 billion of cash provided by operating activities was used to fund the $383 and $353 million of Investing and Financing activities, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $1.6 billion during 2003, which is primarily due to an improvement in working capital. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $383 million during 2003. The cash used in investing activities includes $1.2 billion for property additions, proceeds from asset sales of $1.1 billion, and other cash outflows of $241 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $353 million during 2003, which primarily consists of refinancing and principal payments cash outflow of $690 million offset by proceeds from issuance of stock $337 million. Parent Company Liquidity Because of the non recourse nature of most of our indebtedness, we believe that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is an important measure of liquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity at the parent company level are: Dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds; Proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility; and Proceeds from asset sales. Our cash requirements at the parent company level through the end of 2004 are primarily to fund: Interest and preferred dividends; Principal repayments of debt; Construction commitments; Other equity commitments; Taxes; and Parent company overhead, development costs and taxes. During 2002 and 2003, we undertook numerous actions designed to increase parent liquidity, lengthen parent debt maturities, and reduce parent debt and other contractual obligations, both contingent and non contingent. These actions are consistent with our strategic goals of improving the credit profile of both the parent and the consolidated company in order to reduce our financial risk and improve our credit rating by the major rating agencies. As a result of these actions, our parent liquidity at year end 2003 improved substantially compared to our parent company liquidity at year end 2002. Our parent recourse debt was $5.9 billion at year end 2003 compared with $6.8 billion at year end 2002. Our contingent contractual obligations were $608 million at year end 2003 compared with $871 million at year end 2002. 60 The primary actions we undertook in 2003 to achieve these goals included: (i) selling assets, (ii) issuing common stock, (iii) refinancing parent company debt to mature at later maturity dates, and (iv) redeeming parent debt and other contractual obligations. On May 8, 2003, we completed a $1.8 billion private placement of second priority senior secured notes. We used the net proceeds to (i) repay $475 million of debt outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities, (ii) to repurchase approximately $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes pursuant to a tender offer, (iii) to repurchase approximately $104 million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes pursuant to a tender offer and (iv) for general corporate purposes, which included repurchasing other outstanding securities. On June 23, 2003, we completed an offering of 49,450,000 shares of common stock at $7.00 per share for net proceeds of approximately $334 million. We used $75 million of the proceeds to prepay a portion of the secured equity linked loan issued by AES New York Funding L.L.C. We used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment or repurchase of parent debt. On July 29, 2003 we closed the amended and restated senior secured bank credit facilities providing for a $250 million revolving loan and letter of credit facility and a $700 million term loan facility. Loans under the amended facilities bear a floating interest rate at either LIBOR plus 4% or a base rate plus 3%, and mature on July 31, 2007. As a result of this financing, the total amount of credit available under the amended facilities was increased by approximately $135 million to $950 million. This increase, together with cash on hand, was used to repay in full the $150 million balance of the AES New York Funding secured equity linked loan, resulting in the release of all of the unregistered common stock of AES and other collateral that had secured such loan. In 2003, we sold assets resulting in cash proceeds of $1.1 billion. These cash proceeds to the parent were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment or repurchase of parent debt. We redeemed debt of approximately $3.4 billion during 2003. These redemptions were comprised of $3.3 billion of cash redemptions (both mandatory and optional) and also $77 million of swaps of debt securities into common stock of the parent. Throughout the year, we repurchased outstanding Trust Convertible Preferred Securities (the "TECONS") with an aggregate principal amount of $247 million for approximately $206 million. Throughout the year, we redeemed for cash $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes and $360 million of other senior subordinated notes. We redeemed for cash $26 million of senior secured notes. We also repaid bank facilities of $1.4 billion in 2003. Our non contingent contractual obligations at the parent company level are set forth below: Payment due by period (amounts in millions) Non contingent contractual obligation Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years Over 3 years Total Indebtedness (excluding interest) $ 77 $ 303 $ 5,559 $ 5,939 Trust preferred securities (excluding dividends) 731 731 Construction commitments 38 38 Total $ 115 $ 1,034 $ 5,559 $ 6,708 We also reduced our contingent contractual obligations at the parent company level to $608 million at year end 2003, compared with $871 million at year end 2002. Our contingent contractual obligations at 61 the parent company at year end 2003 are set forth below (in millions, except for number of agreements): Contingent contractual obligations Amount Number of Agreements Exposure Range for Each Agreement Recorded On Balance Sheet Guarantees $ 515 55 &lt;$1 $100 $ 164 Letters of credit under the Revolver 70 7 &lt;$1 $ 36 Letters of credit outside the Revolver 19 2 &lt;$5 $ 14 Surety bonds 4 6 &lt;$1 $ 3 Total $ 608 70 $ 164 We have a varied portfolio of performance related contingent contractual obligations. Amounts related to the balance sheet items represent credit enhancements made by us at the parent company level and by other third parties for the benefit of the lenders associated with the non recourse debt recorded as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. The risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, supplier support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, under construction and operating. While we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations during 2004 or beyond that are not recorded on the balance sheet, many of the events which would give rise to such an obligation are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder. While we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs through the end of 2004, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about exchange rates, power market pool prices, the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and the timing and amount of asset sale proceeds. In addition, our project subsidiaries ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the parent company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in project loans, governmental provisions and other agreements to which our project subsidiaries are subject. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. We have met our interim needs for shorter term and working capital financing at the parent company level with a secured revolving credit facility of $350 million, which is part of our $1.6 billion senior secured credit facilities. We did not have any outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2003. We had $228 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003, we had $70 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving and letters of credit outstanding outside the revolver amounted to $19 million. At December 31, 2002, we had $104 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolver and letters of credit outstanding outside the revolver amounted to $109 million. Various debt instruments at the parent company level, including our senior secured credit facilities, senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes contain certain restrictive covenants. The covenants provide for, among other items: limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; restrictions on dividends and redemptions and payments of unsecured and subordinated debt and the use of proceeds; 62 restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off balance sheet and derivative arrangements; and maintenance of certain financial ratios. Our senior secured notes due 2005 are subject to mandatory redemption provisions including provisions that require us, on November 25, 2004, to redeem 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the approximately $258 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes issued on December 13, 2003 to the extent not previously redeemed (at our option or pursuant to the other mandatory redemption provisions), at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the senior secured notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2003, approximately $232 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes were outstanding. Non Recourse Debt Financing While the lenders under our non recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the parent company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation: reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the parent level during the pendancy of any default; triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary; causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the parent level. For example, our revolving credit agreement and outstanding senior notes, senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes at the parent level include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the parent level includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was $2.3 billion at December 31, 2003, of which approximately $0.6 billion is held at discontinued operations and businesses held for sale. None of the subsidiaries referred to above that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that currently meet the applicable definition of materiality in AESs corporate debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit an acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a "material subsidiary" and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the AES parent companys senior notes, senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In May 1999, one of our subsidiaries acquired six electric generating plants from New York State Electric and Gas. Concurrently, the subsidiary sold two of the plants to an unrelated third party for $666 million and simultaneously entered into a leasing arrangement with the unrelated party. We have accounted for this transaction as a sale/leaseback transaction with operating lease treatment. Accordingly, we have not recorded these assets on our books and we expense periodic lease payments, 63 which amounted to $54 million in 2003, as incurred. The lease obligations bear an imputed interest rate of approximately 9% which approximates fair market value. We are not subject to any additional liabilities or contingencies if the arrangement terminates, and we believe that the dissolution of the off balance sheet arrangement would have minimal effects on our operating cash flows. The terms of the lease include restrictive covenants such as the maintenance of certain coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2003, we fulfilled a lease requirement on the subsidiarys behalf by funding an additional liquidity account, as defined in the lease agreement, in the form of a $36 million letter of credit. However, the subsidiary is required to replenish or replace this letter of credit in the event it is drawn upon or requires replacement. Historically, the plants have satisfied the restrictive covenants of the lease, and there are no known trends or uncertainties that would indicate that the lease will be terminated early. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of this transaction. In 1996, IPL, one of our subsidiaries, formed IPL Funding Corporation ("IPL Funding") to purchase, on a revolving basis, up to $50 million of the retail accounts receivable and related collections of IPL in exchange for a note payable. IPL Funding is not consolidated by IPL or IPALCO since it meets requirements set forth in SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities" to be considered a qualified special purpose entity. IPL Funding has entered into a purchase facility with unrelated parties, whom we refer to as the purchasers. Under the purchase facility, the purchasers agree to purchase from IPL Funding, on a revolving basis, up to $50 million of the receivables purchased from IPL. As of December 31, 2003, the aggregate amount of receivables purchased pursuant to this facility was $50 million. The net cash flows between IPL and IPL Funding are limited to cash payments made by IPL to IPL Funding for interest charges and processing fees. These payments totaled approximately $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. IPL retains servicing responsibilities through its role as a collection agent for the amounts due on the purchased receivables, but may be replaced as servicing agent if IPL fails to meet certain financial covenants regarding interest coverage and debt to capital. The transfers of such retail accounts receivable from IPL to IPL Funding are recorded as sales; however, no gain or loss is recorded on the sale. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion about this arrangement. We have investments in several equity method affiliates including CEMIG in Brazil, and do not consolidate the financial information of these equity method affiliates. Therefore, none of the assets or liabilities of our equity method affiliates are included on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for summarized financial information from our equity method affiliates. 64 Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003 is presented in the table below.

Derivatives and Energy Trading Activities We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk. Although the majority of our derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting, our adoption of SFAS No. 133 in 2001 has resulted in more variation in our results of operations from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recognized $40 million of losses, net of income taxes, primarily related to derivatives which did not qualify for hedge accounting. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of our accounting for derivatives. We do not engage in significant energy trading activities associated with our retail and wholesale supply businesses. We recorded net gains from energy trading activities of $0 million in the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, and $5 million in the year ended December 31, 2001. Related Party Transactions We did not enter into any related party transactions that were material for financial reporting purposes during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. 68 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Overview Regarding Market Risks We are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. We often utilize financial instruments and other contracts to hedge against such fluctuations. We also utilize financial and commodity derivatives for the purpose of hedging exposures to market risk. We generally do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risks We are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and trust preferred securities, as well as interest rate swap and option agreements. Depending on whether a plants capacity payments or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflation, we partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations by arranging fixed rate or variable rate financing. In certain cases, we execute interest rate swap, cap and floor agreements to effectively fix or limit the interest rate exposure on the underlying financing. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risk that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of this risk is that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations in U.S. dollars or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Primarily, we are exposed to changes in the U.S. dollar/United Kingdom Pound Sterling exchange rate, the U.S. dollar/Brazilian Real exchange rate, the U.S. dollar/Venezuelan Bolivar exchange rate and the U.S. dollar/Argentine peso exchange rate. Whenever possible, these subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. We also use foreign currency forward and swap agreements, where possible, to manage our risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas and coal. Although we primarily consist of businesses with long term contracts or retail sales concessions, a portion of our current and expected future revenues are derived from businesses without significant long term revenue or supply contracts. These competitive supply businesses subject our results of operations to the volatility of electricity, coal and natural gas prices in competitive markets. Our businesses hedge certain aspects of their "net open" positions in the U.S. We have used a hedging strategy, where appropriate, to hedge our financial performance against the effects of fluctuations in energy commodity prices. The implementation of this strategy involves the use of commodity forward contracts, futures, swaps and options as well as long term supply contracts for the supply of fuel and electricity. Value at Risk In 2000, we adopted a value at risk ("VaR") approach to assess and manage our risk and our subsidiaries risk. VaR measures the potential loss in a portfolios value due to market volatility, over a specified time horizon, stated with a specific degree of probability. The quantification of market risk using VaR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse markets and instruments. We adopted the VaR approach because we feel that statistical models of risk measurement, such as VaR, provide an objective, independent assessment of our risk exposure. Our use of VaR requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level for expected losses, the holding period for 69 liquidation and the treatment of risks outside the VaR methodology, including liquidity risk and event risk. VaR, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. Our use of VaR allows us to aggregate risks across all of our businesses, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Because of the inherent limitations of VaR, including those specific to the analytic VaR, in particular the assumption that values or returns are normally distributed, we rely on VaR as only one component in our risk assessment process. In addition to using VaR measures, we perform stress and scenario analyses to estimate the economic impact of market changes on the value of our portfolios. We use these results to supplement the VaR methodology. We have performed a company wide VaR analysis of all of our material financial assets, liabilities and derivative instruments. The VaR calculation incorporates numerous variables that could impact the fair value of our instruments, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices, as well as correlation within and across these variables. We perform our interest rate and foreign exchange analysis using VaRworks, a Financial Engineering Associates, Inc. risk management application, which utilizes three methods of VaR calculations; Analytic VaR, Monte Carlo Simulation and Historical Simulation. We express Analytic VaR herein as a dollar amount of the potential loss in the fair value of our portfolio based on a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period. Our commodity analysis is an Analytic VaR utilizing a variance covariance analysis within the commodity transaction management system. During the year ended December 31, 2003, our average daily VaR for interest rate sensitive instruments was $99.1 million. The daily VaR for interest rate sensitive instruments was highest at the end of the third quarter, and equaled $126.9 million. The daily VaR for interest rate sensitive instruments was lowest at the end of the second quarter, and equaled $82.2 million. These amounts include the financial instruments that serve as hedges and the underlying hedged items. During the year ended December 31, 2003, our average daily VaR for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments was $34.1 million. The daily VaR for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments was highest at the end of the first quarter, and equaled $44.1 million. The daily VaR for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments was lowest at the end of the fourth quarter, and equaled $19.7 million. These amounts include the financial instruments that serve as hedges and the underlying hedged items. During the year ended December 31, 2003, our average daily VaR for commodity price sensitive instruments was $5.48 million. The daily VaR for commodity price sensitive instruments was highest at the end of the second quarter, and equaled $6.76 million. The daily VaR for commodity price sensitive instruments was lowest at the end of the third quarter, and equaled $4.0 million. These amounts include the financial instruments that serve as hedges and do not include the underlying physical assets or contracts that are not permitted to be settled in cash. 70
