Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Our Organization and Segments We believe our broad geographic footprint allows us to focus development in targeted markets with opportunities for new investment, and provides stability through our presence in more developed regions. In addition, our presence in each region affords us important relationships and helps us identify local markets with attractive opportunities for new investment. As a result, we have structured our organization into geographic regions, and each region is led by a regional president or other senior executive responsible for managing those businesses. The regional presidents report to our Chief Operating Officer (COO), who in turn reports to our Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Both our CEO and COO are based in Arlington, Virginia. The Companys segment reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively, EMEA), which reflects how we manage the business internally. Additionally, AES Wind Generation is managed within our North America region. For financial reporting purposes, the Company has six reportable segments which include: Latin America Generation; Latin America Utilities; 6 Table of Contents North America Generation; North America Utilities; Europe Generation; Asia Generation. Corporate and Other The Companys Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation and AES Wind Generation businesses as well as the Companys renewables initiatives are reported within Corporate and Other because they do not require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the Companys segment structure used for financial reporting purposes. The following describes our businesses as they are aligned in our segment reporting structure for financial reporting purposes.

AES has one integrated utility in North America, IPL, which it owns through IPALCO Enterprises Inc. (IPALCO), the parent holding company of IPL. IPL generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity to approximately 470,000 customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state of Indiana. IPL owns and operates four generation facilities that provide more than 96% of the electricity it distributes. Two of the generation facilities are coal fired plants. The third facility has a combination of units that use coal (base load capacity) and natural gas and or oil (peaking capacity). The fourth facility is a small peaking station that uses gas fired combustion turbine technology. IPLs gross generation capacity is 3,699 MW. Approximately 45% of IPLs coal is provided by one supplier with which IPL has long term contracts. A key driver for the business is tariff recovery for environmental projects through the rate adjustment process.

Regulatory Matters Overview In each country where we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity and environmental regulations. These regulations affect the operation, development, growth and ownership of our businesses. Regulations differ on a country by country basis and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country. Regulation of our Generation Businesses Our Generation businesses operate in two different types of regulatory environments: Market Environments and Other Environments. Market Environments. In market environments, sales of electricity may be made directly on the spot market, under negotiated bilateral contracts, or pursuant to PPAs. The spot markets are typically administered by a central dispatch or system operator who seeks to optimize the use of the generation resources throughout an interconnected system (the cost of the least expensive next generation plant required to meet system demand). The spot price is usually set at the marginal cost of energy or based on bid prices. In addition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system, such as regulation (a service that corrects for short term changes in electricity use that could impact the stability of the power system). Most of our businesses in Europe, Latin America and the United States operate in these types of liberalized markets. Other Environments. We operate Generation assets in certain countries that do not have a spot market. In these environments, electricity is sold only through PPAs with state owned entities and or industrial clients as the offtaker. Examples of countries where we operate in this type of environment include Jordan, Nigeria, Puerto Rico and Sri Lanka. 21 Table of Contents Regulation of our Distribution Businesses In general, our distribution companies sell electricity directly to end users such as homes and businesses and bill customers directly. The amount our distribution companies can charge customers for electricity is governed by a regulated tariff. The tariff, in turn, is generally based upon a certain usage level that includes a pass through to the customer of costs that are not controlled by the distribution company, including the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and or the costs of purchased energy, plus a margin for the value added by the distributor, which is usually calculated as a fair return on the fair value of the companys assets. This regulated tariff is periodically reviewed and reset by the applicable regulatory agency. Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the customer are usually adjusted through an automated process. In many instances, the tariffs can be adjusted between scheduled regulatory resets pursuant to an inflation adjustment or another index. Customers with demand above a certain level are often unregulated and can choose to contract with generation companies directly and pay a wheeling fee, which is a fee to the distribution company for use of the distribution system. Most of our utilities operate as monopolies within exclusive geographic areas set by the regulatory agency and face limited competition from other distributors. Set forth below is a discussion of certain regulations we operate under in the countries where we do business. In each country, the regulatory environment can pose material risks to our business, operations or financial condition. For further discussion of those risks, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Latin America and Africa Argentina Structure of Electricity Market. The Argentine electricity market is divided into three separate lines of business: generation, transmission and distribution. AES Argentina operates 12% of the installed capacity of the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) and two distribution companies: one under federal jurisdictionEDELAP; and the other under the jurisdiction of the Province of Buenos AiresEDES. The law recognizes a category of large users made up of industrial companies and other consumers with substantial electricity supply needs. The WEM is comprised of: A Term Contracts Market, with contracts freely agreed amongst producers and consumers; A Spot Market, with prices sanctioned on an hourly basis considering the economic cost of production represented by the short term marginal cost (spot prices); and A Stabilization System on a quarterly basis of the prices forecasted for the spot market, created for the purchase of the distributors (seasonal prices). Principal Regulators. The National Electricity Regulating Agency (ENRE) is responsible for ensuring transmission and distribution companies comply with the concessions granted by the Argentine government and approving distribution tariffs. The WEM is managed by Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Administradora del Mercado Mayorista El&eacute;ctrico, Sociedad An&oacute;nima (CAMMESA), the independent system operator. CAMMESA also acts as the dispatch entity, or OED (Organismo Encargado de Desapacho), and manages the organization, dispatch and operations of the WEM at large according to the policies established by the Energy Secretariat, under the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services. In such capacity, CAMMESA is empowered to interpret the rules relating to the organization, dispatch and energy agreements in the WEM. In addition to these duties, CAMMESA manages the information on supply and demand in the WEM, which is used by the Energy Secretariat to fix the seasonal prices and the markets operational rules. CAMMESAs operating costs are borne by the WEMs participants and agents. In the Provincial Jurisdiction, the regulator is the Organismo de Control de la Electricidad de Buenos Aires and the Direcci&oacute;n Provincial de Energ&iacute;a under the Ministry of Infrastructure. 22 Table of Contents Principal Regulations. The electricity sector activities are regulated by the Electricity Act. Law 24.065 and Law 11.796 regulate the activities of generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy in the territory of the Province of Buenos Aires, determining what activities of transmission and distribution of energy are public services, whereas the generation is an activity of general interest. Presently, the price of electric energy is determined assuming all generating units in Argentina are operating with natural gas, even though the generators may be using more expensive, alternative fuels. In the case of generators using alternative fuels, CAMMESA pays the total variable cost of production, which may exceed the established spot price. Additionally, in the spot market, generators are also remunerated for their capacity to generate electricity in excess of supply agreements or private contracts executed by them. The Argentine government has adopted many new economic measures since 2002, by means of the Emergency Law 25561, as amended and extended by various supplemental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations effectively terminated the use of the United States Dollar as the functional currency of the Argentine electricity sector. Distribution companies are ruled by their Concession Contracts on November 12, 2004. Material Regulatory Actions. On July 31, 2008, the ENRE issued Resolution 324 that granted EDELAP a tariff DVA increase of approximately 18%. In addition, the government recognized that a process to establish the RTI (integral tariff reset) should take place during February 2009. On September 12, 2009, EDELAP submitted the tariff reset proposal to the ENRE. ENRE is considering the tariff proposals submitted by the federal distribution companies. If the regulatory agency continues to delay the granting of the tariff increase needed by EDELAP, EDELAP could experience significant operational challenges in the future. Total DVA increase granted to EDELAP pursuant to this process is 66%. In March 2008, the Ministry of Infrastructure of the Province of Buenos Aires issued Resolution 741 which settled a tariff increase of 15% average) to be applied for EDES during 2008 and an increase of 15% average to be applied from 2009. On March 22, 2010, the Ministry of Infrastructure of the Province of Buenos Aires issued Resolution 141 which settled the new tariff to be applied by EDES during 2010. It represents an average increase of approximately 24%. Total DVA increase granted to EDES pursuant to this process is 190%. During 2004, the Energy Secretariat reached agreements with natural gas and electricity producers to reform the energy markets. In the electricity sector, the Energy Secretariat passed Resolution 826/2004, inviting generators to contribute a percentage of their sales margins to fund the development and construction of two new combined cycle power plants to be installed by 2008/2009 (FONINVEMEM I & II). The time period for the funding was set from January 2004 through December 2006 and was subsequently extended through December 2007. During 2008, both power plants started operation of the gas turbines, and since March 2010, the plants started operations in combined cycle mode. In exchange, the Argentine government committed to reform market regulation to match more favorable regulations that existed prior to 2001. Additionally, participating generators will receive a pro rata ownership share in the new generation plants after ten years. Potential or Proposed Regulations. A non binding general agreement with the rest of the Generators operating in Argentina and the government was signed on November 25, 2010 to address a nation wide problem of overdue accounts receivables to the generation market. The non binding agreement established the guidelines for the detailed documentation that will allow the execution FONINVEMEM III project agreement and some additional cash revenues. Under the agreement, accounts receivable accrued from July 2009 to December 2011, for an amount of approximately $204 million will be converted into a generation asset (estimated at 800 MW) to be built under the FONINVEMEM III project. The government will provide funds necessary to finance the projects. The plant will have a PPA with CAMMESA for ten (10) years, calculated to recover 100% of the receivables invested plus a margin of LIBOR + 5%. Payments will be made once the project begins operations. We expect the existing FONINVEMEM I and II documents will be taken as a base for the future contracts; assuming this, the collection of the 120 installment will not be tied to the availability of the plant. Availability 23 Table of Contents risk will be assumed by the operator through a Long Term Service Agreement (LTSA). Some penalties may apply to the generating companies, but only in those cases where the unavailability is caused by their operating decisions not considered in the LTSA. According to this, the yearly penalty would be capped at 10% of the yearly amount required under the PPA. Initially, AES Argentina Generaci&oacute;n S.A. will participate in this proposal under the terms and conditions referred to above. Its equity ownership in the new project will equal its contribution of receivables among the generating companies, estimated to be 24% of the resulting plants. Both power plants that were built under similar regulations started full operation in combined cycle mode in March 2010, and the installments agreed are being paid on a timely basis. Brazil Structure of Electricity Market. In Brazil, there are two regulatory regimes which regulate PPAs the Regulated Contracting Ambience (ACR), for the Generation and Distribution of Electric Power Agents, and the Ambience for Free Contracting (ACL), for the Generation, Commercialization, Importers and Exporters of Energy Power Agents as well as consumers. This model establishes a number of requirements to be followed by the participants in the industry, such as the obligation for distributors to contract for their market growth years in advance through regulated auctions; hydro and thermal energy contracting conditions to ensure better balance between supply cost and system stability; and a permanent supply monitoring structure to detect possible imbalances between supply and demand. Principal Regulators. In Brazil, there are a number of regulatory bodies which govern the electricity sector including the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) and the Chamber of Electrical Energy Commercialization (CCEE). ANEELs responsibilities are to regulate and inspect production, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity in order to assure quality of provided services and universal access. ANEEL is also responsible for the establishment of tariffs for end consumers, in a way that the economic and financial feasibility of power sector participants as Generation, Transmission and Distribution companies and such as the industry as a whole is preserved. The changes brought about in 2004 by the new model made ANEEL responsible for promoting, directly or indirectly, auctions for the Distribution companies to purchase energy through long term contracts within the National Interconnected System (Sistema Interligado Nacional) (SIN). The CCEE (former Mercado Atacadista de Energia) paramount obligations include: the determination of the Differences Price Settlement (Pre&ccedil;o de Liquida&ccedil;&atilde;o de Diferen&ccedil;as) (PLD), or Spot Price, used to value short term market transactions; the execution of the energy accounting process, identifying who and how much electricity is involved in multilateral short term market transactions; the financial settlement of the amounts calculated in the energy accounting process; and preparation and execution of energy auctions within the ACR by ANEELs delegation. Principal Regulations. Distribution Companies. AES has two distribution businesses in Brazil: AES Eletropaulo and AES Sul. Under the power sector model, distribution companies have to purchase electricity at the regulated market through auctions. Every distribution utility is obligated to contract to meet 100% of its energy needs in the ACR. Bilateral contracts are being honored but cannot be renewed. The tariff charged by distribution companies to captive customers is composed of a non manageable cost component (Parcel A), which includes energy purchase costs and charges related to the use of transmission and distribution systems and is directly passed through to customers, and a manageable cost component (Parcel B), which includes operation and maintenance costs based on a model distribution company defined by ANEEL, recovery of depreciated assets and a component for the value added by the distributor (calculated as net asset base multiplied by pre tax weighted 24 Table of Contents average cost of capital). Parcel B is reset every four years for AES Eletropaulo and every five years for AES Sul. There is an annual tariff adjustment to pass through Parcel A costs to customers and to adjust the Parcel B costs by inflation, less an efficiency factor. Distribution companies could also be entitled to extraordinary tariff revisions in the event of significant changes to their cost structure. In the first half of 2010, all distribution companies signed amendments to the Concession Contracts, capturing market variance effects over sector charges. AES Eletropaulo signed its amendment on May 3, while AES Sul signed it on April 12. The 2010 tariff readjustment already reflected such amendment. Additionally, ANEEL conducted a public hearing regarding the partition of the extraordinary tariff reset (RTE) between Generation and Distribution companies. The RTE was designed to recover revenue losses of Distribution companies and energy purchase costs of Generation companies, both during the rationing period that occurred in 2001 and as a result of regulatory, market and weather related conditions. The RTEs period of application for AES Eletropaulo was limited to 70 months, which was not sufficient to recover its revenue losses. The Public Hearing process was concluded on January 12, 2010, generating an initial negative impact before taxes to AES Eletropaulo of R$6.8 million ($4.1 million) recorded in 2009, offset by a positive impact before taxes of R$7.3 million ($4.4 million) recorded in 2010 for additional RTE adjustments. AES Tiet&ecirc; recorded revenue of R$6.2 million ($3.7 million) in 2010. Generation Companies. AES has two generation businesses in Brazil: AES Tiet&ecirc; and AES Uruguaiana. Under the power sector model, the Ministry of Mines and Energy MME determines the amount of energy to be sold by each plant known as assured energy or the amount of energy representing the long term average energy production of the plant defined by ANEEL. Together with the system operator, ANEEL establishes the assured energy which is the amount of energy to be sold by each plant through long term contracts. The system operator determines generation dispatch which takes into account nationwide electricity demand, hydrological conditions and system constraints. In order to mitigate the risks involved in hydroelectric generation for each generator and to optimize the system generation capacity, a mechanism is in place to transfer energy from those who generated more than the average of the system to those who generated less than the average. The energy that is reallocated through this mechanism is priced pursuant to an energy optimization tariff, designed to optimize the use of generation available in the system. AES Tiet&ecirc; is allowed to sell electric power within the ACR and ACL, maintaining the competitive nature of the generation. Generation companies must provide physical coverage from their own power generation or purchase contracts for 100% of their sale contracts. The failure to provide the required physical coverage and or present purchase contracts, which is subject to monthly verification, exposes the generation company to the payment of penalties. Beginning in 2003, 25% of AES Tietes assured energy has been added annually to the volume marketed through a PPA and consequently since 2006, all of AES Tietes assured energy has been sold to AES Eletropaulo. The PPA entered into with AES Eletropaulo which expires on December 31, 2015, and requires that the price of energy sold be adjusted annually based on the Brazilian inflation variation. Before the end of the PPA in 2015, AES Tiet&ecirc; must seek alternatives to the immediate re contracting of its assured energy from 2016 onwards. Existing legislation allows AES Tiet&ecirc; to allocate its energy to the regulated auctions of existing energy, or in the free market through bilateral contracts for non distribution companies. The state of S&atilde;o Paulo stablished some conditions to privatize the generation sector in Sao Paulo state including an obligation to increase generation capacity by 15%, originally to be accomplished by the end of 2007. AES Tiet&ecirc;, as well as other concessionaire generators, were not able to meet this requirement due to regulatory, environmental and hydrological constraints. Currently, the matter is under consideration by the government of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo (related to the increased capacity) after a decision by ANEELs Board of Officers that ANEEL is not the appropriate authority to consider the extension, since the expansion obligation derives from the purchase and sale agreement between AES Tiet&ecirc; and the Government of S&atilde;o Paulo, and not from the concession agreement itself. AES Tiet&ecirc; is reviewing any may pursue the development of certain gas fired facilities in order to meet this obligation. 25 Table of Contents Environmental Regulations. Electric sector companies are subject to strict environmental legislation in federal, state and municipal spheres in matters such as atmospheric emissions and special protected areas. Such companies need permits and authorizations from government bodies in order to conduct their activities. In case of violation of or non compliance with such laws, regulations, permits and authorizations, companies may suffer administrative sanctions such as fines, shutdown of activities, invalidation of permits and the annulment of authorizations. The government Attorneys Office may institute a civil investigation and or promote a public civil action seeking indemnity for environmental or third party damages. Government agencies or other authorities may enact new stricter rules or search for more restrictive interpretations of existing laws and regulations that may oblige power companies to spend additional resources for environmental compliance, including attainment of environmental permits for facilities and equipment that did not require those types of permits previously. Government agencies or other authorities may delay the issuance of permits and necessary authorizations for the development of power companies causing project implementation schedule delays and, consequently, unfavorable effects in the companies businesses and results. Any action in this direction from the government agencies may negatively affect businesses in the power sector and have adverse effects on the business and results of the companies. Material Regulatory Actions. According to the Concession Contract, distribution companies go through a tariff adjustment process every year. AES Eletropaulo was granted an 8.00% average tariff adjustment to be applied to the Companys tariff as from July 4, 2010. AES Suls average tariff adjustment was 5.56% as of April 19, 2010. On May 16, 2002, ANEEL issued the Order #288, a regulation that established the retroactive denial to the choice of not participating in the exposition relief mechanism, a tool that allowed the sale of energy from Itaipu Generating Co. in the Spot Market. Due to its negative impact, AES Sul filed a lawsuit seeking the annulment of Order #288. For a further discussion of this dispute see Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K. Potential or Proposed Regulations. In 2011, the Third Reset Cycle begins; AES Eletropaulos will take place in 2011 and AES Suls will occur in 2013. A public hearing proposed a new methodology for tariff reset and our comments were submitted on January 10, 2011, There is a another on going regarding a new methodology for tariff reset promote a new methodology for defining quality of service indicators. The outcome of these hearings is unknown. However, if the revised tariff is inexplicitly low or our quality of service indicators are found inadequate, there could be a material impact on our business. Cameroon Structure of Electricity Market. Our subsidiaries in Cameroon are involved in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity through AES SONEL, Dibamba Power Development Company (DPDC) and Kribi Power Development Company (KPDC). AES SONEL is an integrated utility which operates approximately 930 MW of generation capacity, two interconnected transmission networks and distributes electricity to approximately 700,000 customers under a 20 year concession agreement that was signed in July of 2001. AES SONEL has the exclusive distribution rights to all medium voltage and low voltage customers, except for customers with an installed capacity of more than 1 MW (Major Customers) who are free to negotiate bilateral agreements. Generation in Cameroon is open for competition and our subsidiary, DPDC, developed, built and is currently operating an 86 MW heavy fuel oil power plant near Douala as an IPP which provides power to AES SONEL under a tolling agreement. In order to meet increasing demand for power, the government is developing the Lom Pangar Dam project on the Sanaga River which will increase the flows of the Sanaga River and increase the generation capacity of the two major hydro power plants currently operated by AES SONEL. The Lom Pangar Dam will also generate 50 MW. Another AES subsidiary, KPDC, is developing a 216 MW gas fired power plant in Kribi as another IPP which will provide power to AES SONEL. Under its Concession Agreement, AES SONEL operates the two interconnected transmission networks in the country: the Southern Grid with a length of 1550 km and the Northern Grid with a length of 665 km. Major 26 Table of Contents Customers, distributors, or vendors can access the grid subject to paying a fee. Sales to low voltage and medium voltage customers are subject to tariff levels agreed to between AES SONEL and the regulator based on the framework established in the AES SONEL Concession Agreement. Management of energy flows on the transmission network is currently undertaken by AES SONEL. Under the Concession requirements, AES SONEL will be required to create a separate legal entity under which the transmission system will operate. Under the regulation in force, such entity is contemplated to be a 100% subsidiary of AES SONEL whose share capital will be opened up to other operators in the sector in accordance with procedures to be approved by the regulator. Principal Regulators. Cameroons electricity regulatory agency, ARSEL, has functional and decision making autonomy, and is run by a Board of Directors and a General Manager assisted by a Deputy General Manager. Its financing is provided by the state budget and fees collected from revenues generated from activities carried out by operators of the sectors concerned. ARSELs decisions are highly influenced by the government via the Ministry of Power, the Prime Ministers Office and the General Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic. The Ministry of Energy and Water is the Ministry mandated to issue specific regulations relating to the electricity sector and to issue the concessions, licenses and authorizations to be granted to the operators in the sector. Principal Regulations. The principal legislative instrument governing the power sector is Law No. 98/022 of December 24, 1998 which sets out a new institutional framework for the Power Sector and lays the foundations for competition in the power market in Cameroon. It is supplemented by the following instruments: Decree No. 2000/464/PM of June 30, 2000 governing the activities of the power sector; Decree No. 2001/021/PM of January 29, 2001 setting out the rates and methods of calculation, collection and distribution of the fees payable by operators involved in the power sector; Ministerial Order No. 061/CAB/MINMEE of January 30, 2001 setting out the documents and fees required in applying for concessions, licenses, authorizations and declarations for the generation, transmission, distribution, export and sale of power; Ministerial Order No. 000013/MINMEE of January 26, 2009 approving the regulation of the public distribution of electricity in Cameroon; and The Concession Agreements and license between the Republic of Cameroon and AES SONEL signed on July 18, 2001 and amended in 2006. Material Regulatory Issues. Cameroon is currently preparing for presidential elections in 2011 and local elections in 2012. Tariff adjustments expected for 2010 were challenged by the government, resulting in shortfalls of compensation due under the Concession Agreement to AES SONEL for 2010 and 2011. Following lengthy negotiations, a compensation agreement was signed by both parties on November 24, 2010, which provides, among other things, for compensation to be paid to AES SONEL by the government of Cameroon for any revenue shortfall in 2010 and 2011 arising from the difference between tariffs applied to end users and tariffs due under the Concession Agreement. The estimated shortfall for 2010 was approximately $22 million, which has been paid in full. The normal tariff mechanisms to end users are expected to be restored in 2012. Environmental Regulations. The environmental regulation is derived from Law No. 96/12 of August 5, 1996 and various implementing decrees and ministerial orders. This regulation applies to all sectors but there are some specific requirements relating to the electricity sector. The main requirement of this regulation is the obligation to conduct an environmental impact analysis for planned construction of new generation installations or new transmission lines or substations. Potential or Proposed Regulations. In addition, there are plans to review the legal and regulatory framework of the power sector to consider the formation of new public entities. Presently, to make up for the power shortage anticipated in 2012 (due to delays in commissioning the Kribi power plant developed by KPDC and the Lom 27 Table of Contents Pangar Dam developed by the government) and the additional demand generated by a number of infrastructural projects, the government is planning to construct thermal plants with an overall capacity of 40 MW and a hydroelectric plant with a capacity of 200 MW. Additionally, there are other generation projects whose specifications have yet to be clearly determined. The regulatory framework relating to the development of this new capacity and to the future contractual relationship between these new projects and AES SONEL is still unclear. However, the tariff compensation agreement referred to above provides that additional costs imposed on AES SONEL with regard to these projects shall be fully passed through in tariffs charged to end users. Despite the provisions of the regulation described above relating to the operation of the transmission network, the Minister of Energy has formally expressed his preference for a different solution that would take responsibilities for transmission activity and management of the transmission grid away from AES SONEL and assign them to a new public entity to be created and majority owned by the state. The impact on AES is not known at this time; however, it could be material to our results of operations. Chile Structure of Electricity Market. In Chile, except for the small isolated systems of Ays&eacute;n and Punta Arenas, generation activities are principally in two electric systems: the Central Interconnected Grid (SIC), which supplies approximately 92% of the countrys population; and the Northern Interconnected Grid (SING), where the principal users are mining and industrial companies. Power generation is based primarily on long term contracts between generation companies and customers specifying the volume, price and conditions for the sale of energy and capacity. The law recognizes two types of customers for generation companies: unregulated customers and regulated customers. Unregulated customers are principally consumers whose connected capacity is higher than 2 MW and consumers whose connected capacity is between 500 kW and 2 MW who have selected the unregulated pricing mechanism for a period of four years. These customers are not subject to price regulation and are able to freely negotiate prices and conditions for electricity supply with generation and distribution companies. Regulated customers are those whose connected capacity is less than or equal to 500 kW and those with connected capacity between 500 kW and 2 MW who have selected, also for four years, the regulated pricing system. Electricity generation in each of the SIC and the SING is coordinated by the respective independent Economic Load Dispatch Center (CDEC) in order to minimize operational costs and ensure the highest economic efficiency of the system, while fulfilling all quality of service and reliability requirements established by current regulations. In order to satisfy demand at the lowest possible cost at all times, each CDEC orders the dispatch of generation plants based strictly on variable generation costs, starting with the lowest variable cost, and does so independent of the contracts held by each generation company. Thus, while the generation companies are free to enter into supply contracts with their customers and are obligated to comply with such contracts, the energy needed to satisfy demand is always produced by the CDEC members whose variable production costs are lower than the systems marginal cost at the time of dispatch. For this reason, in each hour a given generator is either a net supplier to the system or a net buyer. Net buyers pay net suppliers the systems marginal cost. In addition, the Chilean market is designed to include payments for capacity (or firm capacity), which are explicitly paid to generation companies for contributing to the systems sufficiency. The cost of investment and operation of transmission systems is borne by generation companies and consumers (regulated tolls) in proportion to their use. Principal Regulators. The Chilean Ministry of Energy, created in 2010, grants concessions for the provision of the public service of electric distribution and the National Commission for the Environment administers the system for evaluating the environmental impact of projects. Thermoelectric plants do not require electrical concession agreements from the government in order to be built or operate. The new Ministry of Energy works with several agencies related to energy issues, such as the National Energy Commission (NEC), the Electricity and Fuel Superintendent and the Chilean Nuclear Commission, among others, in order to provide a better coordination of energy affairs. The Ministry of Energy will also oversee a new Energy Efficiency agency. The 28 Table of Contents NEC establishes, regulates and coordinates energy policy. The Superintendent of Electricity and Fuels oversees compliance with service quality and safety regulations. The General Water Authority issues the rights to use water for hydroelectric generation plants. The Chilean electric system includes a Panel of Experts an independent technical agency whose purpose is to analyze and resolve in a timely fashion conflicts arising between companies within the electric sector and among one or more of these companies and the energy regulators. In addition, the Ministry of Environment is responsible for the development and implementation of environmental regulations, protection of the environment, environmental education and pollution control, among others. Principal Regulations. The distinct electricity sector activities are regulated by the General Electricity Services Law. Sector activities are also governed by the corresponding technical regulations and standards. The keystones of the electricity regulation are: (i) a regulated compulsory marginal cost dispatch based on audited variable costs; (ii) a contract based wholesale generation market; (iii) an open access regime for transmission with benchmark regulation for existent transmission lines and open bids for new lines; (iv) benchmark regulation for the distribution grid; and (v) electricity retailing by distribution companies in their exclusive concession areas. In accordance with these laws, new contracts assigned by distribution companies for consumption from 2010 onward must be awarded to generation companies based on the lowest supply price offered in public bid processes. These prices, called long term node prices, include indexation formulas and are valid for the entire term of the contract, up to a maximum of fifteen years. More precisely, the long term energy node price for a particular contract is the lowest energy price offered by the generation companies participating in each respective bid process, while the long term capacity node price is that set in the node price decree in effect at the time of the bid. On February 17, 2011, President Sebastian Pineras administration enacted an energy decree that enables the government to take preventive measures to reduce the risk of future energy shortages. Chile is experiencing a significant drought that has diminished the countrys reservoir levels and hydroelectric power capacity affecting the (SIC). The decree will be in forced until August 2011 and focuses on three main actions: cutting available voltage by 10 12.5%; saving reservoir capacity up to 500 GWh; and offering incentives for consumers to save electricity. The decree is not expected to have a material impact on AES Geners results in 2011 Environmental Regulations. Law 20,257 was enacted in April 2008 and promotes non conventional renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energy. The Law requires that a percentage of the new power purchase contracts held by generation companies after August 31, 2007 be supplied from renewable sources. The required energy percentage begins at 5% for 2010 2014, and gradually increases to a maximum of 10% in 2024. Generation companies are charged for each kWh not supplied in accordance with the Law. Our businesses in Chile have developed a plan for complying with this law, which includes the sale of certain water rights, the purchasers of which have agreed to build a small hydroelectric plant and sell the energy to our businesses in Chile at a fixed price. Potential or Proposed Regulations. In December 2009, the environmental agency published a draft of a potential new ruling which will regulate the emissions from thermal power plants of NOX, SO2, particulate matter (PM) and metals. The President of Chile approved the regulation on January 18, 2011 and the regulation will become effective upon approval of the General Comptroller of Chile. The regulation will require AES Gener, our Chilean subsidiary, to install emissions reduction equipment at its existing thermal plants from late 2011 through 2015. The exact costs of compliance with such regulation have not yet been determined and the Company believes some of the compliance costs are contractually passed through to counterparties. However, the compliance costs could be material. A proposed law which would give new incentives to Non Conventional Renewable Energy (NCRE) such as solar, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energy is under discussion in the Congress. The proposed law 29 Table of Contents increases the requirements of NCRE beginning 2015, such requirements reaching 20% as a percentage of the customer load in 2020. The current law imposes a requirement to reach 10% in 2024. The new requirements would need to be fulfilled with NCRE coming from the same system (separates SIC and SING). The NCRE would need to be accredited by the NEC, which may impose fines for non compliance. The impact to AES Gener is under analysis; however, it will depend on the new size limit of small run of river units and if the new requirement affects the current supply contracts, which only include the 10% required by the current law. The proposed law, if passed, could result in increased costs or otherwise have a material impact on our results of operations. In September 2010, the NEC proposed a new normative in Ancillary Services (AASS) based on a cost efficient regulation informed by generators and customers. The normative regulates the AASS transactions among generators in: regulation, spinning reserve, non operating reserve and the Automatic Load Shedding Scheme (ALSS). AES Gener has presented observations principally against compulsory investments requested by the CDEC; AASS costs allocated incorrectly among generators according to their power generation (it believes it should be according to their electricity withdrawals) and the ALSSs are a demand side obligation and adjustment mechanisms are only considered for imbalances in contributions between consumers. AES Gener is assessing the potential impact of this regulation, and an estimate of the impact can only be established when the final regulation is issued. However, if passed, the regulations could result in required investments or other increased costs which could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations. Colombia Structure of Electricity Market. Colombia has one main national interconnected system (the SIN). The wholesale market is organized around both bilateral contracts and a mandatory pool and spot market for all generation units larger than 20 MW. In the spot market, each unit bids its availability and a set price for a 24 hour period. The dispatch is arranged from lowest to highest bid price and the spot price is set by the marginal price. There are two types of customers: unregulated customers and regulated customers. Unregulated customers are consumers whose maximum capacity consumption is higher than 0.1 MW, or whose energy demand is greater than 55 MWh/month. These customers are not subject to price regulation; therefore, generators or trader companies are able to freely negotiate prices and conditions for electricity supply with them. Regulated customers have their prices determined by means of public tenders. Electricity generation in the Colombian system is coordinated by the market administrator whose goal is to minimize operational costs while fulfilling all quality of service and reliability requirements established by current regulations. In order to satisfy demand at the lowest possible cost at all times, market administrator orders the dispatch of generation plants based on offer price (variable cost plus reliability charge) by merit, starting with the lowest offer price, and does so independent of the contracts held by each generation company. For this reason, in each hour a given generator is either a net supplier to the system or a net buyer. Net buyers pay net suppliers the systems spot price. In addition, the Colombian market is designed to include reliability payments, which are paid to generation companies for contributing to the systems sufficiency. The cost of investment and operation of transmission systems are borne by the consumers in proportion to their use. Principal Regulators. The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) establishes the energy policies and the Regulatory Commission of Electricity and Gas (CREG) was created to foster the efficient supply of energy through regulation of the wholesale market, the natural monopolies of transmission, and distribution, and by setting limits for horizontal and vertical integration. The Ministry of the Environment (MMA) establishes the environmental policies. The Public Services Superintendence supervises the correct provision of utilities and the Industry and Commerce Superintendence is in charge of sanctioning any anticompetitive practice. Other entities that have an 30 Table of Contents impact on the electric system include the Energy Planning Unit (UPME), in charge of planning the electricity and gas system, and the National Development Planning Office (DNP), whose main role is to develop a general development plan for the government. Principal Regulations. The laws of Domiciliary Public Services and the Electricity Law set the institutional arrangement and the general regulatory framework for the electricity sector. The keystones of the electricity regulation are: (i) the dispatch is based on an offer price that represents the variable cost of the plants; (ii) a contract based wholesale generation market; (iii) an open access regime for transmission with revenue regulated for existent transmission lines and open bids for new lines; (iv) revenue regulated for the distribution grid; and (v) electricity retail can be performed by distribution and or traders. The spot market started in July 1995, and in 1996 a capacity payment was introduced for a term of ten years. In December 2006, a regulation was enacted that replaced the capacity charge with the reliability charge and established two implementation periods. The first period consists of a transition period from December 2006 to November 2012 during which the price is equal to $13.045 per MWh and volume is determined based on each plants firm energy which is prorated so that the total firm energy level does not exceed system demand. During the second period, which begins on December 2012, the reliability charge will be determined based on the energy price and the volume of offers submitted by market participants bidding for new capacity for the system. The first reliability charge auction was held in May 2008 with the following results: (i) the reliability charge for existing plants for the period between December 2012 and November 2013 will be $13.998 per MWh; (ii) for new plants that won the auction, the charge will be paid for twenty years starting December 2012; and (iii) three new projects won the auction for a total capacity of 430 MW starting in 2012. The new methodology established in 2006 recognized the reliability provide by Chivors system and favored the company by increasing the reliability charge by approximately 120%, moving from $18 million in 2006 to almost $40 million in 2007 and is expected to have a similar amount per year until 2015. Environmental Regulations. In Colombia, Law 99 created the MMA in 1993. This law requires that projects that affect the land or impact the environment must obtain a license from the MMA. While regional environmental authorities can issue licenses for generation projects with capacity of less than 100 MW, only the MMA has the authority to issue licenses for the construction of large scale generation or transmission projects. Chivor initiated operations in 1977 through a water concession, the only environmental requirement at that time. Furthermore, in August 1995 the MMA requested hydroelectrical plants, including Chivor to fulfill the requirements of an Environmental Management Plan, which serves as an environmental permit to operate. Each year, Chivor has to demonstrate to the environmental authorities that the obligations included in such plan are accordingly fulfilled. Additionally, hydro plants must contribute 6% of their gross generation and thermal plants 4% of their gross generation to the area of influence valued at a special tariff defined by CREG. In 2008, MMA issued Resolution 909 that regulates the emission of thermal power plants. This Resolution is not expected to affect Chivor because it is a hydro but could affect AES if we decide to acquire or build a thermal plant in Colombia. Potential or Proposed Regulations. CREG issued a proposal to create the Organized Regulated Market (MOR). The MOR will replace the current bilateral contracts markets (between traders/utilities and generators) by putting in place a centralized auction in which the Market Administrator buys energy for all regulated customers served by the traders/utilities. The main provisions contained in the proposal are: (i) it is mandatory for all traders/utilities to buy energy at the auction price and it is voluntary for sellers (generators and trade companies) to offer energy in each auction; (ii) one single price for the energy sales in the auction; (iii) the auctions are held one year before the actual dispatch and the commitment period of the auction is one year; and (iv) to establish four auctions per year. Bilateral contracts executed before the beginning of the MORs operation will not suffer any change and will remain valid. In general, we consider that if MOR is correctly designed, it should benefit our businesses in Colombia. We expect that a definitive resolution will be issued in the first half of 2011. 31 Table of Contents During 2010, MME issued Decree 2730 which intends to solve the potential long term and or cyclical unavailability of gas by (i) importing LNG and (ii) establishing strategic storage alternatives. Also, the government presented the basis for the National Development Plan 20112014. For the electricity sector, the plan mainly focuses on: (i) maintaining stability of the current regulatory framework, supporting the current reliability charge structure, promoting fair competition among technologies and guaranteeing no new taxes to transactions made in the wholesale market; (ii) assuring energy supply for the medium and long term; (iii) enhancing and strengthening the electricity markets competitiveness in order to maintain investment confidence and convert the electricity system in Colombia into a world class sector; (iv) making the right decisions in the natural gas sector to make it reliable; and (v) promoting institutional improvement guided by transparency, independence and efficiency. Among these initiatives, they are considering reviewing the separation of National Dispatch Center from the Commercial Transactions Administrator and self regulation initiatives to avoid or minimize interventions in the market by the government. These initiatives also seek to resolve the gas supply problem for thermal plants. As a result, we believe they may be favorable to our business in Colombia because they may improve the overall reliability of the electricity system and reduce the current uncertainties. Additionally, we believe these initiatives may help Chivor better manage its water resources and its associated risk and may also provide more certainty about long term energy prices. Furthermore, the National Development Plan proposal aims to maintain the stability and certainty of the market rules in order to consolidate the investor trust. As a part of CREG regulatory agenda for 2011, the regulator is planning to review the lessons learned from the dry conditions brought by the 2009 10 El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon and issue regulations for these extreme events, permitting players to know in advance the additional reliability measures that the regulator may take under those circumstances. Also, CREG is planning to issue regulations that will strengthen the energy market by improving the spot market guarantees scheme, and establish measures to control market power from pivotal agents (agents needed at any cost to fulfill the demand requirements). This last initiative may affect spot prices but should not materially impact AES as Chivor has a high level of coverage through bilateral contracts. Dominican Republic Structure of Electricity Market. The Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system composed primarily of thermal generation and supplemented by hydroelectric power plants that harness power from available rivers. The regulatory framework in the Dominican Republic consists of: decentralized industry; unbundled generation, transmission and distribution; regulated prices in monopolistic segments (transmission and distribution); and a competitive wholesale generation market. In accordance with this regulatory structure, all agents and electric generation, transmission and distribution companies must conduct their operations to provide the best service at minimum cost; and comply with standards of quality, safety, continuity of services and conservation of the environment. The spot or wholesale market is based on a centralized economic dispatch. The Organismo Coordinador (OC) is in charge of planning and supervision of operations through the Centro del Control del SENI, which is in charge of real time dispatch. The dispatch of the thermal units is based on auditable declared variable costs and, for the hydro units, the variable cost is equal to zero, meaning that these units are the first for dispatch and reflect optimal system costs. The spot market relies on competitive bidding based on each generators variable costs as a means of providing a merit order for dispatch. Variable cost information is submitted weekly by the generators to the OC, which then determines the merit order for dispatch based on this information. For the sale of electricity under long term contracts, the regulatory framework establishes that the sale of electricity of a generating company to a distribution company will be done at prices resulting from the competitive procedures of public bidding. These bids are governed by the conditions established by the Superintendency of Electricity (SIE) which supervises the bidding and awarding process. With the objective of ensuring that generation prices represent reasonable values in the market, the SIE ensures that the sale of electricity through contracts is not greater than 80% of interconnected electric energy demand, and that the spot market represents a minimum of 20% of the total national consumption of the interconnected system annually. 32 Table of Contents The electricity tariff applicable to regulated customers is subject to regulation within the concessions of the distribution companies. Electricity end users are considered customers of public services according to regulations; hence the tariff is set by resolution of the SIE. For clients with demand above 1.2 MW who are classified as unregulated customers, tariffs are unregulated. Principal Regulators. In order to regulate the electric sector and implement the provisions contained in the General Electricity Law No. 125 and its By Law, two regulators are responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the law: the National Energy Commission (CNE) and the SIE. All electric companies (generators, transmission and distributors), are subject to and regulated by the General Electricity Law, whether they are of national and or foreign capital, private and or public. In general, CNEs main responsibilities are to draft and coordinate the legal framework and regulatory legislation; propose and adopt policies and procedures to assure best practices; draft plans to ensure the proper functioning and development of the energy sector and propose them to the executive branch; ensure compliance with the law; promote investment decisions in accordance with these plans; and advise the executive branch on all matters related to the energy sector. The SIEs main responsibilities are to develop, ensure compliance with and analyze the structure and level of prices of electricity and to set the rates and tolls subject to regulation. SIE also reviews electricity rate levels requested by companies, monitors and supervises compliance with legal provisions and rules and monitors compliance with the technical procedures governing generation, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity. In addition, SIE supervises electric market behavior in order to avoid monopolistic practices and applies penalties and fines in the cases of non compliance with the laws and regulations. Principal Regulations. The energy sector regulatory framework in the Dominican Republic is governed primarily by: General Electricity Law 125 01, its by law and its amendment by Law 186 07, constitute the legal framework which regulates all phases related to the production, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity, as well as the functions of State agencies created by this Law and related to these matters. The regulatory framework in the Dominican electricity market establishes a methodology for calculating the firm capacity for each power generation unit. Renewable Energy Incentives Law 57 07 establishes incentives for renewable energy, mainly income tax exemption, import taxes reduction, as well as special operational, technical and commercial treatment. The law applies to hydro generation with a capacity equal to or below 5 MW, wind generation with a capacity less than 50 MW, biomass generation with a capacity less than 80 MW, photovoltaic generation, and thermo solar generation with a capacity less than 120 MW. Hydrocarbons Law 112 00 is a regime that established a tax on consumption of fossil fuels and oil. All fossil fuels used to produce electricity has a tax exemption under the law, as well as natural gas, and any change in this regulation does not affect AES Dominicana as a natural gas provider. All agents that use any fossil fuel to produce electricity need a resolution from CNE and the Industry and Commerce Ministry to apply for this exemption. Industry and Commerce Ministry periodic resolutions for technical and price regulations for vehicular natural gas use (transportation). In addition, the Dominican government has directly exercised varying degrees of regulation over the electricity market and AES Dominicanas businesses in the past, such as involvement in the re negotiation of the existing PPAs, oversight responsibilities of the SENI and environmental controls. No assurance can be given that the Dominican government will not alter regulations in the future in a way that will negatively affect AES Dominicanas businesses, financial conditions or results of operations. Environmental Regulations. The main environmental regulations are the General Law on Environment and Natural Resources 64 00 and the Regulation and Licensing Systems Environmental Permits by law. These 33 Table of Contents regulations provide for centralized environmental planning by the state through the integration of environmental protection and economic development plans in a common approach and policy throughout the sector. Environmental management is achieved through permits or environmental licenses, environmental quality standards and environmental reporting. The main regulatory institutions are: The Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources, which is responsible for implementing and designing the policy for the conservation and protection of the environment and natural resources in the Dominican Republic; National Council of Environment and Natural Resources which is the link between the various Ministries of State in charge of evaluating the impact of environmental policies; and Procurator for the Defense of the Environment and Natural Resources, which is responsible for performing the actions by the State Environmental conflicts environment. Despite extensive compliance plans in place by each of the entities, it is possible AES Dominicana generating units could fall out of compliance with such environmental standards. Such non compliance, and resulting penalties or bad publicity might negatively affect the financial results of AES Dominicana. One such penalty could be a requirement that AES Dominicana operates its offending unit below its rated capacity, and such unavailability might affect compliance with obligations under its PPAs. In such a scenario AES Dominicana might need to make significant investments in environmental related infrastructure. In addition, the environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent and AES Dominicana might be forced to make certain investments to be compliant with the new standards. Potential or Proposed Regulations. Last year, the CNE proposed a Natural Gas Act, which seeks to establish new regulations for the services and the commercialization of natural gas, which may result in access barriers to develop the natural gas market. The proposed law does not establish a mechanism for promoting investments in the construction of new gas pipelines or kits for fuel conversion for the automotive sector in accordance with modern regulation in this market. However, AES does not currently expect any material impact to AES Dominicana with the promulgation of such law, mainly because AES Dominicanas role is as a supplier of natural gas to the Dominican Republic, which is not regulated under the Natural Gas Act. El Salvador Structure of Electricity Market. The Salvadorean electricity market is composed of a single interconnected system. Under the General Electriticity Law (GEL), competition was introduced in generation and trading and additional regulations were implemented related to price and quality of service in non competitive segments such as distribution, transmission, system operation and administration. The wholesale electricity market is based on a contract market and a spot market. The contract market is further classified into bilateral contracts, which are freely negotiated by electricity generators, distributors, and trading companies; and regulated contracts, which are the product of regulated public bids carried out by the distribution companies under the supervision of the Regulator, Superintendencia General de Electricidad y Telecomunicaciones (SIGET). Starting in June 2011, the distribution companies are required to acquire 70% of their forecasted demand through regulated bids. The spot market is structured as a day ahead market, and transactions are settled on a monthly basis. Currently, the price setting mechanism for the spot market is based on a bidding system. Regulations are in place to implement a cost based system to replace the current bidding system. Distribution companies are regulated under an incentive system, specifically a Revenue Cap system, whereby the maximum tariff to be charged to the end users is subject to the approval of SIGET. The components of the electricity tariff are (i) charges for the use of the distribution network (the Distribution Charge), (ii) customer service costs (the Service Charge) and (iii) average energy price (the Energy Charge). Both the 34 Table of Contents Distribution Charge and Service Charge are based on average capital costs as well as operation and maintenance costs of an efficient distribution company. The Distribution Charge and Service Charge are approved by SIGET every five years and have two adjustments: (i) an annual adjustment considering the inflation variation and (ii) an automatic adjustment in April, July and October, provided that the change in inflation is greater than 10%. Competition is encouraged by the GEL and it provides the end user with the option to acquire its electricity from a Distribution Company or an electricity trader. The Distribution and Transmission Companies are mandated by the GEL to allow the use of the distribution grid to traders in order to deliver electricity to their customers. The grid access terms, including tariffs, are detailed in a distribution contract registered and regulated by SIGET. Principal Regulators. SIGET is the Independent Regulatory Authority established through the GEL. SIGETs principal responsibilities and attributions are approval of Distribution Charges, enforcement of sector regulation, dispute resolution among market participants, granting concessions for hydroelectric and geothermal projects, among others. In addition, the National Energy Council, formed in 2007, is the policy making entity, whose board of directors is composed by the Secretaries of the Treasury, the Economy, Public Works, Environmental and Natural Resources and the Consumer Protection Agency. Principal Regulations. The electricity sector is governed by the General Electricity Act, the General Electricity Act Regulations, the Transmission System and Wholesale Market Operating Regulations and the general and specific orders issued by SIGET, under its statutory attributions. Environmental Regulations. The environment is protected through the Environment and Natural Resources Act (ENRA), enacted in 1998, and its Regulation, enacted in 2000. These statutes empower the Environment and Natural Resources Secretary as the policy making entity and ENRA establishes a duty of care to the environment and orders the sustainable use of natural resources. Additionally, ENRA introduces the concept of the Environmental Permit for the handling of certain potentially hazardous or risky materials or performing certain activities in the environment, such as the construction and operation of power plants (except fuel oil) and transmission lines. Material Regulatory Actions. The Energy Charge has been, under current methodology, adjusted every six months to reflect the spot market price for electricity during the previous six months. However, starting on January 12, 2011, the energy charge will be adjusted quarterly. Presidential decree 160 was published on December 23, 2010 and went into effect on January 1, 2011. This decree shortens the Energy Charge reset period from six months to three months; the new Energy Charge reset dates will be January 12th, April 12th, July 12th and October 12th instead of April 12th and Oct 12th each year. The reduction of the energy charge reset period reduces the distribution companies cash flow exposure before any significant spike in energy prices since the lag between energy revenues and costs has been reduced by half. Potential or Proposed Regulations. The Transmission System and Wholesale Market Operating Rules have been amended to convert the wholesale market price setting mechanism to be based on audited variable production costs instead of a competitive bidding process and will become effective in June 2011. However, this effective date may be delayed due to technical delays necessary for implementation. Again, since electricity costs are a pass through for distribution companies, such new regulation will have an indirect benefit to the companies by providing a stable, marginal cost of electricity. Nigeria Structure of Electricity Market. In Nigeria, the state owned entity, Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), holds approximately 80% of the electricity market share and private power generating companies account for the remaining 20%. The power generating companies, of which AES Nigeria Barge Ltd. (AESNB) is one, maintain long term contracts with PHCN as the sole offtaker. 35 Table of Contents All power transmission operations are currently carried out by PHCN. Under new political initiatives and reforms, as provided under the Roadmap for Power Sector Reforms (the Power Roadmap), there are indications that 11 distribution companies and six generation companies would be fully privatized while the ownership of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) would be retained by the government, but with private sector management. Current electricity generation is from either gas fired or hydro power plants. Most assets are owned by state owned companies, though some private investors have been able to establish IPPs following recent reforms. In addition, the government is developing approximately 4,800 MW of installed capacity intended to be completed by 2013, known as the National Integrated Power Plants (NIPPs). The Presidential Task Force on Power has announced its intention to privatize the NIPPs in future rounds of privatization, following completion of construction. Principal Regulators. The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (Nigerian ERC) is an independent regulatory agency, that was established under the 2005 Reform Act to undertake both the technical and economic regulation of the Nigerian electricity sector. It is responsible for general oversight functions, including the licensing of operators, setting of tariffs and industry standards for future electricity sector development. Two of the Nigerian ERCs key regulatory functions are licensing and tariff regulation. Since AESNB operates under a long term bilateral agreement with PHCN, it is not subject to the tariff setting process. On the basis of the current reforms embodied in the Power Roadmap, a number of new regulatory and or other governing bodies will be established to regulate the industry. Principal Regulations. In March 2005, the Nigerian President signed the Electric Power Sector Reform Bill into law, enabling private companies to participate in transmission and distribution in addition to electricity generation that had previously been legalized. The government has separated PHCN into eleven distribution firms, six generating companies, and a transmission company, in preparation for privatization. Several problems, including union opposition, have delayed the privatization indefinitely, however, in recent months the current Government has put significant emphasis on completing the privatization of the eighteen successor companies of the PHCN in 2011. There are clauses in the AESNB PPA that, upon the effective date of a privatization, require the business to use all reasonable endeavors to obtain and require all fuel necessary for the operation of the plant. Additionally, the off taker is envisaged to be transferred from PHCN to Lagos State. However, no material impact to our operations is expected at this time. Potential or Proposed Regulations. The Nigerian Government is currently preparing for an election in 2011 and privatization of the electricity sector has been a principal issue emphasized by political parties. The 2005 Reform Act and NERC regulations provide for a generation license to have a duration of 10 years, renewable for a further five years. This is in line with a current proposal for a uniform tariff for the power sector, MYTO, which is derived from a building blocks approach that intends a cost reflective outcome, including a capacity and an energy component; financing costs and other key costs (operating costs, depreciation) are intended to be accommodated; and key fluctuating costs (fuel costs, foreign exchange, inflation) are also intended to be reflected. A total license and uniform tariff duration of 15 years may present challenges to potential investors given that 15 years may be shorter than the useful life of assets and shorter than the tenor of potential long term debt financing. These regulations, if adopted, could make it difficult to acquire or develop new facilities. Panama Structure of Electricity Market. In Panama, distribution companies are required to contract 100% of their annual power requirements (although they can self generate up to 15% of their demand). Generators can enter into long term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into alternative supply contracts with each other. The terms and contents of PPAs are determined through a competitive bidding process and are governed by the Commercial Rules. Besides the PPA market, generators may buy and sell energy in the spot market. Energy sold in the spot market corresponds to the hourly differences between the actual dispatch of energy by each generator and its contractual commitments to supply energy. The energy spot price is 36 Table of Contents set by the order in which generators are dispatched. The National Dispatch Center (CND) ranks generators according to their variable cost (thermal) and water value (hydroelectric), starting with the lowest value, thereby establishing on an hourly basis the merit order in which generators will be dispatched the following day in order to meet expected demand. Principal Regulators. The National Secretary of Energy (SNE) was created by Law 52 on July 30, 2008; and has the responsibilities of planning, investigating, directing, supervising and controlling policies of the energy sector within Panama. With these responsibilities, the Secretariat has defined strategies and policies for the Republic of Panama, which include promoting energy security for the benefit of the population and the countrys development, and proposing laws and regulations to the executive agency that promote the procurement of electrical energy, hydrocarbons and alternative energies in the best conditions for the country. The regulator of public services, known as the National Authority of Public Services (ASEP), was created by Law 26 on January 29, 1996. ASEP is an autonomous agency of the state, with legal responsibility and self patrimony. ASEP is responsible for the control and oversight of public services, such as potable water, sewerage, electricity, telecommunications and radio and television systems, as well as the transmission and distribution of natural gas utilities and the companies that provide such services. ASEPs mission is to ensure the efficient provision of the public services, as well as national technical, commercial, and environmental quality standards. Principal Regulations. In the Republic of Panama, the electricity sector is regulated by Law No. 6 issued on February 1997 which was amended by Law Decree 10 on February 26, 1998, and more recently by Law 57 on October 2009. The most notable amendments by Law 57 were: (i) generators are now obligated to participate in public bids for PPAs, to the extent they have available firm capacity and energy, and failure to do so precludes them from participating in the spot market; (ii) ETESA, as opposed to the distribution companies, will now be the purchaser in charge of adjudicating PPA bids to the winning generators, subsequently assigning such PPAs to the corresponding distribution companies; and (iii) the maximum fines which ASEP may impose for violations to the provisions of the Electricity Law increased from $1 million to $20 million. Resolution AN No. 3885 Elec, which was approved on October 8, 2010, sets forth the methodology for calculating the capacity and or energy that generators must make available for short term bids and long term contracting. These amendments state that ETESA has to prepare the list of charges, make the call for bids and evaluate and award contracts for supply in accordance with the parameters, criteria and procedures established by ASEP. Consequently, ASEP must approve the list of charges produced by ETESA in addition to overseeing the process to confirm it complies with legal requirements and current regulations. Environmental Regulations. ASEP issued Resolution AN No. 3932 Elec on October 22, 2010 related to the Security of Dams in the Electricity Sector. This legislation has sensitive and important Security and Environmental elements related to: reports, controls by ASEP, protocols for modifications to the structure of the dams and the operation of dams and reservoirs during floods. This regulation will be effective on November 9, 2011, but it will require a thorough process to review our current action plans during emergencies and protocols against the requirements of the new law to properly determine the impact to AES Panama. However, the new requirements may require AES Panama to expend additional amounts which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Material Regulatory Actions. By virtue of Resolutions AN No. 34 01 Elec on April 1, 2010 and Resolution AN No. 3852 Elec on September 21, 2010, ASEP declared the Changuinola I project to be of public interest and urgent necessity (granting AES access to private properties near the project). The owner of one of the Fincas (land) filed a constitutional action alleging violations of due process and private property rights. The impact to the business is that if the Supreme Court admits the request, this will automatically suspend the effects of the ASEP resolution and the project will no longer be of public interest. This could impact AES Panamas authorization with regard to the premises and impede progress on the project. AES Panama has requested that the Supreme Court reject the action filed. For further discussion see Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K. 37 Table of Contents Potential or Proposed Regulations. In July 2010, ASEP hired Consorcio Fundaci&oacute;n Bariloche PSI Consultores to evaluate alternative allocation of the Charge per Usage of the Principal Transmission System in order to encourage the development of alternative sources of generation, especially hydropower. The consultants expect to deliver their final report by mid January 2011 to ASEP but as of mid February 2011 the consultants have not delivered the report. Once ASEP receives the report it is expected to present the amendments to the current transmission rates for public comment and the amendments are expected to take effect on July 1, 2011. This could result in a possible reduction of the amounts currently being paid by AES Panama in transmission rates. On October 13, 2010, ASEP requested the CND to make an amendment to the weekly programming methodology so that the hydroelectric dams with a reservoir regulation equal to or less than ninety (90) days should be modeled as run of the river units with zero variable cost. Under the current regulations, the Changuinola I Plant is defined as a hydro plant with a reservoir regulation of 7.26 days. The proposed modification will cause the Changuinola I Plant to be considered as a run of the river plant. It is estimated that this change could result in a reduction in energy generated by approximately 18 GWh/year for AES Panama, which is a substantial impact on AES Panama and could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. Furthermore, this proposal could change the firm capacity of Changuinola II. Currently, the proposal is under analysis by ASEP. North America Mexico Structure of Electricity Market. Mexico has a single national electricity grid (referred to as the National Interconnected System), covering nearly all of Mexicos territory. The only exception is the Baja California peninsula which has its own separate electricity system. Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution reserves the generation, transmission, transformation, distribution and supply of electric power exclusively to the Mexican State for the purpose of providing a public service. In Mexico, since 1995 the power sector legal framework partially opened to private entities under the following schemes: cogeneration; self supply; IPP exports; and imports for self consumption. Private investments are allowed today in this sector in the following areas: transport, storage, and distribution. The Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) is in charge of issuing the permits related to the activities from the power and natural gas sectors that were open to private investment since 1995. Principal Regulators. The Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), by virtue of Article 1 of the Energy Law, is granted sole and exclusive responsibility for providing this public service as it relates to the supply, transmission and distribution of electric power. Principal Regulations. In 1992, the Energy Law was amended to allow private parties to invest in certain activities in the Mexico electrical power market, under the assumption that self supply generation of electric power is not considered a public service. These reforms allowed private parties to obtain permits from the Ministry of Energy for (i) generating power for self supply; (ii) generating power through co generation processes; (iii) generating power through independent production; (iv) small scale production; and (v) importing and exporting electrical power. Beneficiaries holding any of the permits contemplated under the Energy Law are required to enter into PPAs with the CFE with regard to all surplus power produced. It is under this basis that AES M&eacute;rida and TEG/TEP facilities operate. M&eacute;rida provides power exclusively to CFE under a long term contract. TEG/TEP provides the majority of its output to two offtakers under long term contracts, and can sell any excess or surplus energy produced to CFE at a predetermined day ahead price. Environmental Impact. When works or activities that may disrupt the ecological balance or exceed the limits and conditions established in the applicable laws or the regulations are proposed, these activities shall be subject 38 Table of Contents to the conditions established by regulatory authorities, for the purposes of reducing to a minimum the negative effects on the environment. In these cases, it is necessary to first obtain the authorization on environmental impact matters from the regulatory authorities. In addition, high risk activities are also regulated even though they do not define specifically what is meant by high risk. The Mexican Department of the Interior issued two lists defining high risk substances. The criteria used to determine whether an activity is of high risk, is based in the characteristics or volume of the substance used, where relevant. If in the event of being spilt or released it is liable to cause an explosion or significantly affect the environment, people or property, it will be considered as of high risk. Further, if a project contemplates the use of a compound included in the lists issued by the regulator, in the necessary volumes, the interested Party must present a Risk Evaluation before the regulator. Environmental Sanctions. The Attorney Generals Office for the Protection of the Environment is in charge of enforcing environmental legal provisions in Mexico. The sanctions that may be imposed depend on the environmental obligations that are not observed by individuals or corporations, and vary from fines ranging from the equivalent of 50 and up to 50,000 days of minimum wage. Additional sanctions may also be imposed, including the annulment of environmental permits and authorizations, partial or total closures of a facility, and administrative arrest. Mexican Legislation provides that the energy sector is integrated by the Electrical and Petroleum sectors. Federation is the only one entitled to extract and process fossil fuels, as well as to generate electricity; however, certain exceptions apply. Renewable Energy. On October 23, 2008, a proposal for the approval of the Renewable Energies and Financing of the Energy Transition Law was sent for the approval of the Mexican House of Representatives, and on October 25, 2008, this same proposal was approved by the Energy Committee of the same House. The law encourages generation and transportation of energy generated by renewable sources, giving certainty and lower costs to provide incentives to participate in the private sector of this field. In addition, the Federal governments all encompassing Special Program on Climate Change (SPECC) was formally approved. The SPECC provides a program to reduce the alleged effects of climate change. The principal actions proposed to achieve competitive levels, include the gradual substitution of oil for natural gas in the national energy mix, stimulating the implementation of cogeneration and other efficiency saving technologies and strongly stimulating the development of renewable energies. Priority will be given to electricity generation from wind (up to 507 MW installed by 2012), geothermal energy (153 MW installed by 2012), hydroelectric and solar power. The SPECC proposes a joint program between public bodies and private investors in order to increase the amount of electricity generation capacity from renewable sources up to 1,957 MW by 2012. The SPECC makes it clear that many of its objectives will be achieved through the following normative, economic and market instruments: accessible financing mechanisms; simplification procedures for permitting; facilitation of electrical grid interconnection and transmission contracts; and stimulus for private investment in energy infrastructure. Our businesses in Mexico are still reviewing the impact of these developments on their operations; however, they could be material to the business and results of operations. United States Structure of Electricity Market. The United States wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are subject to both federal regulation, as implemented by the FERC, and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and implemented by the Independent System Operators (ISO). These rules for the most part govern such items as the determination of the market mechanism for setting the system marginal price 39 Table of Contents for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity. The current regulatory framework in the United States is the result of a series of regulatory actions that have taken place over the past two decades, as well as numerous policies adopted by both the federal government and the individual states that encourage competition in wholesale and retail electricity markets. Principal Regulators. The federal government, through regulations promulgated by FERC, has primary jurisdiction over wholesale electricity markets and transmission services. While there have been numerous federal statutes enacted during the past 32 years, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct 1992) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), there are two fundamental regulatory initiatives implemented by FERC during that time frame that directly impact our United States businesses: FERC approval of market based rate authority beginning in 1986 for many providers of wholesale generation; and FERC issuance of Order #888 in 1996 mandating the functional separation of generation and transmission operations and requiring utilities to provide open access to their transmission systems. FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the Federal Power Act (FPA) which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1 million per violation for each day that the violation continues. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under Part II of the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in EPAct 2005. With this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the FPA and FERCs regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past. Pursuant to EPAct 2005, the North America Reliability Corporation (NERC) has been certified by FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the United States to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. These standards are subject to FERC review and approval. Once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Monetary penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation may be assessed for violations of the reliability standards. Principal Regulations for Generation Businesses. Several of our generation businesses in the United States currently operate as Qualifying Facilities (QFs) as defined under PURPA. These businesses entered into long term contracts with electric utilities that had a mandatory obligation at that time, as specified under PURPA, to purchase power from QFs at the utilitys avoided cost (i.e., the likely costs for both energy and capital investment that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own generating capacity or purchase it from another source). EPAct 2005 later amended PURPA to provide for the elimination of the mandatory purchase obligation in certain markets, but did so only on a prospective basis. Cogeneration facilities and small power production facilities that meet certain criteria can be QFs. To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or cooling applications in certain proportions to the facilitys total energy output, and must meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small power production facility must generally use a renewable resource as its energy input and meet certain size criteria. Our non QF generation businesses in the United States currently operate as Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs) as defined under EPAct 1992. These businesses were historically exempt from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and are also exempt from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), and, subject to FERC approval, have the right as public utilities under the FPA to sell power at market based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. Under the FPA and FERCs regulations, approval from FERC to sell 40 Table of Contents wholesale power at market based rates is generally dependent upon a showing to FERC that the seller lacks market power in generation and transmission, that the seller and its affiliates cannot erect other barriers to market entry and there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving regulated affiliates of the seller. To prevent market manipulation, FERC requires sellers with market based rate authority to file certain reports, including a triennial updated market power analysis for markets in which they control certain threshold amounts of generation. Principal Regulations for Traditional Utility Business. In addition to our generation businesses, we also own IPL, a vertically integrated utility located in Indiana. A description of the regulatory environment under which IPL operates is provided below: IPL. As a regulated electric utility, IPL is subject to regulation by the FERC and the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC). As indicated below, the financial performance of IPL is directly impacted by the outcome of various regulatory proceedings before the IURC and FERC. IPL is subject to regulation by the IURC with respect to the following: its services and facilities; the valuation of property; the construction, purchase or lease of electric generating facilities; the classification of accounts; rates of depreciation; retail rates and charges; the issuance of securities (other than evidences of indebtedness payable less than twelve months after the date of issue); the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities; and certain other matters. IPLs tariff rates for electric service to retail customers (basic rates and charges) are set and approved by the IURC after public hearings (general rate cases). General rate cases, which have occurred at irregular intervals, include the participation of consumer advocacy groups and certain customers. The last general rate case for IPL was completed in 1995. In addition, pursuant to statute, the IURC is to conduct a periodic review of the basic rates and charges of all Indiana utilities at least once every four years, but the IURC has the authority to review the rates of any Indiana utility at any time it chooses. Such reviews have not been subject to public hearings. The majority of IPL customers are served pursuant to retail tariffs that provide for the monthly billing or crediting to customers of increases or decreases, respectively, in the actual costs of fuel (including purchased power costs) consumed from estimated fuel costs embedded in basic rates, subject to certain restrictions on the level of operating income. These billing or crediting mechanisms are referred to as trackers. This is significant because fuel and purchased power costs represent a large and volatile portion of IPLs total costs. In addition, IPLs rate authority provides for a return on IPLs investment and recovery of the depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses associated with certain IURC approved environmental investments. The trackers allow IPL to recover the cost of qualifying investments, including a return on investment, without the need for a general rate case. IPL may apply to the IURC for a change in its fuel charge every three months to recover its estimated fuel costs, including the energy portion of purchased power costs, which may be above or below the levels included in its basic rates and charges. IPL must present evidence in each fuel adjustment charge (FAC) proceeding that it has made every reasonable effort to acquire fuel and generate or purchase power, or both, so as to provide electricity to its retail customers at the lowest cost reasonably possible. Independent of the IURCs ability to review basic rates and charges, Indiana law requires electric utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC to meet operating expense and income test requirements as a condition for approval of requested changes in the FAC. Additionally, customer refunds may result if IPLs rolling twelve month operating income, determined at quarterly measurement dates, exceeds IPLs authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income and there are not sufficient applicable cumulative net operating income deficiencies against which the excess rolling twelve month jurisdictional net operating income can be offset. In IPLs ten most recently approved FAC filings (FAC 81 through 90), the IURC found that IPLs rolling annual jurisdictional retail electric net operating income was lower than the authorized annual jurisdictional net 41 Table of Contents operating income. FAC 90 includes the twelve months ended October 31, 2010. In IPLs FAC 76 through 80 filings, the IURC found that IPLs rolling annual jurisdictional retail electric net operating income was greater than the authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income. Because IPL has a cumulative net operating income deficiency, IPL was not required to make customer refunds in its FAC proceedings. In December 2007, IPL received a letter from the staff of the IURC requesting information relevant to the IURCs periodic review of IPLs basic rates and charges and IPL subsequently provided information to the staff. Since IPLs cumulative net operating income deficiency (described above) requires no customer refunds in the FAC process, the IURC staff was concerned that the higher than usual 2007 earnings may continue in the future. In response to the inquiry, IPL provided voluntary credits to its retail customers totaling $32 million. IPL recorded a $30 million deferred fuel regulatory liability in March 2008 and a $2 million deferred fuel regulatory liability in June 2008, with corresponding and respective reductions against revenues for these voluntary credits. All of these credits have been applied in the form of offsets against fuel charges that customers would have otherwise been billed during June 1, 2008 through February 28, 2009. Over the past few years, IPL has received correspondence from the IURC on a few occasions expressing concern for IPLs level of earnings and inquiring about IPLs depreciation rates. In response, IPL provided additional information to the IURC relevant to IPLs earnings as well as the results of a depreciation analysis that IPL conducted. In the fourth quarter of 2010, IPL received a letter from the IURC stating that they did not have any additional questions. IPL is a member of the Midwest Independent System Operator, Inc. (Midwest ISO). Midwest ISO serves as the third party operator of IPLs transmission system and runs the day ahead and real time Energy Market and, beginning in January 2009, the Ancillary Services Market for its members. IPL transferred functional control of its transmission facilities to the Midwest ISO and its transmission operations were integrated with those of the Midwest ISO. IPLs participation and authority to sell wholesale power at market based rates are subject to the FERC jurisdiction. Transmission service over IPLs facilities is now provided through the Midwest ISOs tariff. As a member of the Midwest ISO, IPL offers its generation and bids its demand into the markets operated by the Midwest ISO on an hourly basis. The Midwest ISO settles energy hourly offers and bids based on locational marginal prices, which is pricing for energy at a given location based on a market clearing price that takes into account physical limitations, generation and demand throughout the Midwest ISO region. The Midwest ISO evaluates the market participants energy offers and demand bids optimizing for energy products to economically and reliably dispatch the entire Midwest ISO system. The Company has certain regulatory assets on its balance sheet relating to IPLs participation in the Midwest ISO. The IURC has authorized IPL to recover the fuel portion of its costs from the Midwest ISO, to defer certain operational, administrative and other costs from the Midwest ISO and seek recovery in IPLs next basic rate case proceeding. Total Midwest ISO costs deferred by IPL as long term regulatory assets were $71.0 million and $62.8 million as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. IPL will seek to recover the deferred costs in its next basic rate case proceeding; however, there can be no assurance that IPL would be successful in that regard. Beginning in 2007, Midwest ISO transmission owners, including IPL, began to share the costs of transmission expansion projects with other transmission owners after such projects were approved by the Midwest ISO Board of Directors. Upon approval by the Midwest ISO Board of Directors, the transmission owners must make a good faith effort to build the projects. Costs allocated to IPL for the projects of other transmission owners are collected by the Midwest ISO per their tariff. We believe it is probable, but not certain, that IPL will ultimately be able to recover from its customers the money it pays to the Midwest ISO for its share of transmission expansion projects of other utilities, but such recovery is subject to IURC approval in IPLs next basic rate case. Therefore, such costs to date have been deferred as long term regulatory assets. To date, such costs have not been material to IPL. However, given the magnitude of the costs anticipated to enable conformance with renewables mandates in the Midwest ISO footprint, it is probable that such costs will become 42 Table of Contents material in the next few years. Our current estimates are that IPLs share of such costs could be more than $50 million annually by 2020 and continue increasing after that. In 2004, the IURC initiated an investigation to examine the overall effectiveness of Demand Side Management (DSM) programs throughout the State of Indiana and to consider any alternatives to improve DSM performance statewide. On December 9, 2009, the IURC issued a Generic DSM Order that found that electric utilities subject to its jurisdiction must meet an overall goal of annual cost effective DSM programs that reduce retail kWh sales (as compared to what sales would have been excluding the DSM programs) of 2% per year by 2019 (beginning in 2010 at 0.3% and growing to 2.0% in 2019 subject to certain adjustments). The IURC also found that all jurisdictional electric utilities have to participate in five initial, statewide core DSM programs, which will be administered by a Third Party Administrator. Consequently, IPLs DSM spending, both capital and operating, will increase significantly going forward, which will likely reduce IPLs retail energy sales and the associated revenues. Prior to the issuance of the Generic DSM Order, IPL filed a petition seeking relief for substantive DSM programs. IPL proposed a DSM plan to be considered in two phases. The first phase (Phase I) sought recovery for traditional type DSM programs, such as residential home weatherization and energy efficiency education programs, with additional offerings. The IURC issued an Order in February 2010 that approved the programs included in IPLs Phase I request. In addition to IPLs traditional recovery of the direct costs of the DSM program, the Order also included performance based incentives. The second phase (Phase II) sought recovery for Advanced DSM programs and was coincident with IPLs application for a smart grid funding grant from the Department of Energy. The Advanced DSM programs included an Advanced Metering Infrastructure communication backbone as well as two way meters and home area network devices for certain of IPLs customers. In February 2010, the IURC issued an Order that approved IPLs Phase II program, but denied IPLs request to timely recover its expenditures. Instead, IPL would need to seek recovery of the costs incurred under its Phase II program during its next basic rate case proceeding. In June 2010, IPL filed a petition with the IURC seeking authority for an additional DSM program and to recover the lost revenue resulting from decreased kWh consumption and kW demand beginning on June 11, 2010 as a result of the implementation of all approved DSM programs. The IURC granted IPLs request related to the additional DSM program, but denied the request to recover lost revenue. Additionally, in October 2010, IPL filed a petition with the IURC for approval of its plan to comply with the IURCs Generic DSM Order, which petition includes estimated DSM spending of approximately $65 million from 2011 to 2013. It is not possible to predict at this time what the IURCs response will be to this petition. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes various provisions that fund the development of the electric power industry at the federal and state level. These provisions include, but are not limited to, improving energy efficiency and reliability; electricity delivery (including smart grid technology); energy research and development; renewable energy; and demand response management. IPL submitted a Smart Grid Investment Grant for $20 million to provide its customers with tools to help them more efficiently use electricity and also to upgrade its delivery system infrastructure. IPLs application was approved and the agreement with the United States Department of Energy was executed in April 2010. Environmental Regulations. See Environmental and Land Use Regulations below for a description of the United States Environmental Regulations. 43 Table of Contents Europe, Middle East & Asia Europe European Union Structure of Electricity Market. All European Union (EU) member states are required to implement EU legislation, although there is a degree of disparity as to how such legislation is implemented and the pace of implementation in the respective member states. EU legislation covers a range of topics which impact the energy sector, including market liberalization and environmental legislation. The Company has subsidiaries which operate existing generation businesses in a number of countries which are member states of the EU, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Company also has subsidiaries which are in the process of commissioning a generation plant in Bulgaria. Bulgaria became a member state of the EU as of January 1, 2007. Principal Regulations. The principles of market liberalization in the EU electricity and gas markets were introduced under the 2003 Electricity and Gas Directives. In 2005, the European Commission (the Commission) launched a sector wide inquiry into the European gas and electricity markets. To tackle the issues identified in the inquiry and to further improve the regulatory framework for energy liberalization, the Commission launched the Third Energy Package in 2007. In the context of the electricity market, the inquiry has to date focused on identifying issues related to price formation in the electricity wholesale markets and the role of long term agreements as a possible barrier to entry with a view to improving the competitive situation. In January 2007, the Commission published a proposal for a new common energy policy for Europe. In November 2008, the Commission published a non binding second Strategic Energy Review aimed at developing the concept of a common European energy policy. It focused mainly on security of supply and infrastructure development. The Strategic Energy Review proposed reviews of the Gas Storage Directive in 2010 and an update of the Oil Stocks Directives. In October 2008, the Energy Ministers reached political agreement on the Third Liberalization Package, which includes five pieces of legislation, Electricity and Gas Directives, Electricity and Gas Regulations and a Regulation creating a new Agency for the Coordination of Energy Regulators, which will have limited powers to deal with cross border interconnectors and related issues. This legislation was formally adopted in August 2009 and must be implemented on a national level by March 2011. Environmental Regulations. See Environmental and Land Use Regulations International below for a description of these directives. Bulgaria Structure of Electricity Market. The Bulgarian energy sector model allows for trading at regulated prices, at freely negotiated prices between parties or on the organized market. Since an organized market has not evolved yet despite the availability of adequate legislative framework for it, the primary means for wholesale trading is the regulated market, the bilateral transactions market and the Electricity Balancing Mechanism. These arrangements are also supplemented by an imbalance settlement regime. The Bulgarian power market has evolved from a system where the National Electricity Company (NEK), established in November 1991 as a fully state owned vertically integrated utility, was responsible for the entire cycle of generation, transmission and distribution. After a decade of functioning in this role, NEK was vertically unbundled with a resulting legal separation of generation, transmission and distribution assets into different operating entities. While these structural reforms greatly helped create a competitive electricity sector, there are no actual trading rules to enable the market to operate freely. To ensure accessible customer prices and support to renewable energy supply (RES) producers and the highly efficient cogeneration assets, NEK is still acting as single buyer, purchasing the majority of power generated in Bulgaria and then selling the power to distribution companies or to transmission network connected consumers or to export across interconnectors (as the sole 44 Table of Contents licensed Bulgarian power exporter). NEK also owns the biggest hydro electric and pump storage generation facilities in Bulgaria. While the transmission system in Bulgaria remains under NEKs formal ownership, to comply fully with EU legislation, NEK has spun off transmission operations (i.e., system operation, balancing market administration and systems operation and maintenance) to the Electricity System Operator. The system also allows for a regulated third party access. Principal Regulators. The State Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (SEWRC) established in 1999 is the independent regulator for both the energy and water markets. SEWRCs key responsibilities are: Licensing activities in the electricity, heat and natural gas sectors; Regulating electricity, heat and natural gas prices (including those from RES and CHP power sources); Regulating interconnection to distribution and transmission networks; and Issuing of certificates of origin and green certificates for the electricity produced from RES and co generation. Principal Regulations. Bulgaria is at a juncture of adopting legislative packages that cover three key European policy goals energy independence (Directive 2009/28/EC), environmental sustainability through GHG emissions control (Directive 2009/29/EC) and market liberalization (Directive 2009/72/EC). In line with these EU mandated goals, the government of Bulgaria has set the following key priorities: a 20% reduction of the energy intensity of GDP by 2013 and a 50% reduction by 2020; increased renewables share of the total energy consumption to 12% by 2013 and to a minimum of 16% by 2020; and competitive energy market through promoting new generation entry, security of supply, and sustainable development. A key milestone would be a 30% increase of bilateral contracts in the electricity market by 2013. A key law that sets the stage for the above priorities is the Bulgarian Energy Act developed in 2004 (the BEA) with a view to a transparent and predictable regulatory environment to promote further liberalization through an independent regulatory authority. The BEA creates a framework for viable commercial companies in the sector through more investment, greater autonomy of SERWC and more effective commercial restructuring. The BEA is structured so that the market can shift away from the single buyer model into a more market oriented third party network access model that allows for trading at regulated or freely negotiated prices, as well as at a free market exchange. To be in full compliance with the EU Third Energy Package, the BEA is being amended in order for the electricity market to be fully liberalized under clear regulatory rules and sustainable market mechanisms. Recent amendments to the BEA are making clear the commitment of the government to honoring long term contracts for power purchasing with generators whose investments have helped upgrade the national asset base. To help further develop the energy market, the SERWC developed new Trading Rules, adopted in the summer of 2010, where generators, consumers and grid operators are organized in balancing groups for the most cost effective balance between energy supply and consumption. An underlying principle of the Trading Rules will be the presence of a Day ahead market (a departure from the existing practice of weekly notification schedules). Importantly, the Trading Rules will also establish the principles for the Bulgarian power exchange, all in line with the EUs Third Energy Liberalization legislation. Environmental Regulations. The main environmental regulations reflect the implementation of EU environmental directives. As of January 2007, Bulgaria is introducing EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) as the main mechanism for meeting Kyoto Protocol GHG reduction commitments. The Bulgarian Environmental Protection Act amended on September 27, 2005, and all secondary legislation following from it, have incorporated all EU and Kyoto emission reduction commitments. The Bulgarian National Allocation Plan (NAP) allows a total of 42.3 million tonnes of CO2 for the whole volume of fossil fuel based generation in the country. The AES Galabovo coal based power plant will be covered by the NAP at 80% of its projected 45 Table of Contents generation for 2011 and 2012. The portion of CO2 allowances which are not covered by NAP will be billed directly to NEK. Bulgaria is also subject to the Large Combustion Plant Directive (2001/80/EC) (LCPD), which aims to reduce particulate emissions by controlling SO2, NOX and dust from large combustion plants. The LCPD allows for existing plants to opt for exemption from the emission level values, as long as the operator undertakes not to operate for more than 20,000 hours starting from January 1, 2008 and ending no later than December 31, 2015. Major rehabilitation work has been taking place across units of various Bulgarian thermal power plants in the last decade. The rehabilitated Maritza East 2 complex is now fitted with electrical filters for capturing dust and Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) units (more than 94% efficiency). The AES Galabovo power plant, which is currently in the process of commissioning, is equipped with a state of the art wet FGD system that ensures 98% of SO2 removal. Bulgaria is dependent on foreign imports for 70% of its primary fuel sources, which makes exploration of renewable energy sources paramount for the countrys achievement of energy independence and environmental objectives. Bulgarias EU mandated renewable targets have been met mostly by hydro power plants with limited contribution to the fuel mix by wind energy and even less from biomass. The main goal of the Renewable and Alternative Energy Sources and Biofuels Act of 2007 is to encourage generation from and grid interconnection of installations utilizing renewable energy sources. Material Regulatory Actions. In connection with Bulgarias accession into the EU, the European Commission (the Commission) has opened an investigation into alleged anti competitive behavior and possible restrictions of competition in the Bulgarian electricity markets. The current focus of the Commissions investigation is NEK. As part of its investigation, the Commission is attempting to determine whether NEKs long term contracts are anti competitive, including its long term PPAs with AES Bulgarian entities, AES Maritza East and AES Geo Energy. Accordingly, the Commission has issued separate information requests to AES Maritza and AES Geo Energy about their respective PPAs with NEK. While these particular requests were voluntary, both AES Maritza and AES Geo Energy have cooperated in good faith with the Commission, have provided the requested information and have met with the Commission in order to provide background and any further required information about the projects. The Commission has clearly specified that neither AES Maritza nor AES Geo Energy were the target of the investigation. We believe the Commission is partly concerned that long term PPAs could pose a problem with respect to the liberalization of Bulgarias electricity markets but we believe that the projects and their respective PPAs did not tie up capacity but created capacity that would not otherwise exist. However, if the Commission determined that PPAs are anti competitive, they could take actions up to and including termination of our PPA, which could have a material adverse impact on AES Maritza and our results of operations and financial condition. Potential or Proposed Regulations. The AESB Act referred to above is currently being amended in order to better incorporate the EU principles set forth in Directive 2009/29/EC. Recent draft amendments to the AESB Act ensure predictability for off take tariffs for wind project investments that have been undertaken in the last several years (including the AES owned Saint Nikola Wind Farm) as well as create new development opportunities for solar power, including the new solar power projects in the Bulgaria pipeline of AES Solar. Czech Republic Structure of Electricity Market. In accordance with EU directives regarding market liberalization, all electricity customers in the Czech Republic are able to select their energy supplier. Since August 2007, the Prague Energy Exchange has been trading energy in the form of base load and peak load on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. The majority of electricity is, however, still traded on a bilateral contract basis between generators and distributors, independent traders and also between generators and final customers. In February 2008, a day ahead spot market was incorporated into the Prague Energy Exchange. Another important entity active in the energy sector is OTE, which is responsible for: processing and reporting business balance of electricity according to data supplied by electricity market participants; organization of short term markets and 46 Table of Contents the balancing market by regulating energy in cooperation with transmission system operator; and evaluation and settlement of imbalances between the agreed and actual electricity supplies and consumption. Principal Regulators. The Energy Regulatory Office regulates the energy sector by granting permits for businesses in the energy sector. The main tasks of the Energy Regulatory Office are: supporting competition, supporting the use of renewable and secondary energy resources, and protection of consumer interests in monopolistic markets. Principal Regulations. The principal regulations are those which implement EU regulations. The energy activities are regulated mainly by Act No. 458, as amended, which provides the conditions for business activity, the exercise of public administration and nondiscriminatory regulation in the energy sectors, including the electricity, gas and heat sectors, as well as the rights and obligations of individuals and legal entities related thereto, in compliance with the law of the European Communities. The other principal law is Act No. 180/2005 Coll., as amended, on the promotion of electricity production from renewable energy sources which regulates, in accordance with the legislation of the European Communities, the method of promoting the production of electricity from renewable energy sources and from mining gas from closed mines, the performance of state administration and the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons connected therewith. The methodology of price control in each line of business is governed by Regulation No. 438/2001 (as amended) which regulates the procedures for price control in the energy sector. The revenue cap regulatory method has been selected for electricity transmission and distribution activities. Actual regulated fees associated with transmission and distribution as fees for capacity payments, network usage, renewable subsidies in the form of feed in tariffs or green bonuses and system services charges, are actualized annually in the relevant price decision issued by the Energy Regulatory Office. The gradual liberalization of the electricity market made all customers eligible customers and trading is not subject to regulation. Energy activities are also governed by the corresponding technical regulations and standards. Environmental Regulations. The principal environmental regulations are the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations 76/2002 Coll. These regulations introduce a pollution control system known as Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC). AES Bohemia is subject to air pollution control and is regulated by the Regional Environmental Authority. The key concept of the regulations concerns the application of Best Available Techniques (BAT) in order to prevent pollution. The PPC regime requires installations operating certain activities to apply for a permit to operate. The PPC permit contains conditions on: waste management; material storage and handling; releases to air, water and land; environmental management techniques; accident prevention and control; monitoring, reporting and record keeping; and site decommissioning. Material Regulatory Actions. During 2010, as a result of a feed in tariff for solar plants, the Czech Republic experienced a boom in solar installation tripling installed capacity from January 1, 2010. This forced the government to introduce new measures for solar plants to limit the future support to only smaller installations, reduce feed in tariffs and implement a new tax regime. However, solar installation has already significantly affected the grid by making any development of new projects more difficult due to limited free capacity in the grid. In addition, the government decided to introduce a gift tax on free allocated CO2 credits to electricity generators to generate additional resources for financing renewable electricity in the future and to protect electricity customers, at least partly, from a major increase in the regulated fee for the support of renewable electricity. Although the law stipulates that the CO2 gift tax should not be paid from cogeneration electricity, it is assumed now that the AES Bohemia tax duty may exceed $1.5 million payable in the first quarter of 2011. The final regulation, which will provide calculations of the gift tax for cogeneration producers has not been issued yet. Hungary Structure of Electricity Market. The Hungarian market has one main interconnected system. The state owned electricity wholesaler, MVM, is the dominant exporter, importer and wholesaler of electricity. MVMs affiliated company, MAVIR, is the Hungarian transmission system operator. Currently, Hungary is dependent on 47 Table of Contents energy imports (mainly from Russia) since domestic production only partially covers consumption. The wholesale market is legally liberalized, although it remains dominated by MVM due to MVMs access to and control over a significant portion of the Hungarian generating facilities. The spot market is relatively illiquid with trading dominated by over the counter or bilateral contracts. Relative to more western parts of Europe, the volumes traded are smaller and typically for shorter durations, although contracts with a duration that is greater than one year are available. Principal regulators. Magyar Energia Hivatal (MEH) is the government entity responsible for regulation of the electricity industry in Hungary. The Ministry of National Development oversees the activities of the MEH. Principal Regulations. The main regulations in Hungary are those being implemented under EU directives, the adoption of the Hungarian Electricity Act in 2007, which became effective January 1, 2008, was the final legislative step to implement a fully liberalized electricity market. By virtue of the Hungarian Electricity Act, all customers are eligible to choose their electricity supplier. In the competitive market, generators sell capacity to wholesale traders, distribution companies, other generators, electricity traders and eligible customers at an unregulated price. In the light of the third energy liberalization package issued by the EU in 2009, Hungary is planning to implement a major amendment of the Electricity Act and the Gas Act which will conform to the EU package. Environmental Regulations. The main environmental permit is the Integrated Pollution Prevention Control (IPPC). The IPPC Directive is based on several principles, namely (i) an integrated approach, (ii) BAT, (iii) flexibility and (iv) public participation. The integrated approach means that the permits must take into account the whole environmental performance of the plant, covering, e.g., emissions to air, water and land, generation of waste, use of raw materials, energy efficiency, noise, prevention of accidents and restoration of the site upon closure. The purpose of the Directive is to ensure a high level of protection of the environment taken as a whole. The permit conditions including emission limit values must be based on Best Available Techniques (BAT) as defined in the IPPC Directive. To assist the licensing authorities and companies to determine BAT, the Commission organizes an exchange of information between experts from the EU Member States, industry and environmental organizations. This work is coordinated by the European IPPC Bureau of the Institute for Prospective Technology Studies at the EU Joint Research Centre in Seville, Spain. This results in the adoption and publication by the Commission of the BAT Reference Documents (the BREFs). The IPPC Directive contains elements of flexibility by allowing the licensing authorities, in determining permit conditions, to take into account the technical characteristics of the installation, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions. Finally, the Directive ensures that the public has a right to participate in the decision making process, and to be informed of its consequences, by giving the public access to permit applications in order to provide their opinions, permits, results of the monitoring of releases and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E PRTR). E PRTR provides emission data reported by Member States accessible in a public register, which is intended to provide environmental information on major industrial activities. E PRTR has replaced the previous EU wide pollutant inventory, the so called European Pollutant Emission Register. Material Regulatory Actions. Shortly before its accession to the EU, the Hungarian government notified the Commission of arrangements concerning compensation to the state owned electricity wholesaler MVM. The Commission decided to open a formal investigation in 2005 to determine whether any government subsidies were provided by MVM to its suppliers which were incompatible with the common market. In June 2008, the Commission reached its decision that these PPAs, including AES Tiszas PPA, contain elements of illegal state aid. The decision required MVM to terminate the PPAs within six months of the June 2008 decision, and to recover the alleged illegal state aid from the generators by April 2009. AES Tisza is challenging the Commissions decision in the Court of First Instance of the European Communities. Referring to the Commissions decision, Hungary adopted act number LXX of 2008 which terminates all long term PPAs in Hungary, including AES Tiszas PPA, as of December 31, 2008, and requires generators to repay the alleged illegal state aid that was allegedly received by the generators through the PPAs, and provides for the possibility to offset the generators stranded costs from the repayable state aid. The MEH issued its Resolution No. 342/2010 pursuant to which it stated AES Tisza did not receive illegal state aid. 48 Table of Contents At the end of 2006 and for all of 2007, the Hungarian government reintroduced administrative pricing for all electricity generators, overriding PPA pricing, including the pricing in AES Tiszas PPA. In January 2007, AES Summit Generation Limited (AES Summit), a holding company associated with AES Tiszas operations in Hungary, and AES Tisza notified the Hungarian government of a dispute concerning its acts and omissions related to AES substantial investments in Hungary in connection with the reintroduction of the administrative pricing for Hungarian electricity generators. In conjunction with this, AES Summit and AES Tisza have commenced International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) arbitration proceedings against Hungary under the Energy Charter Treaty in connection with Hungarys reintroduction of the administrative pricing for Hungarian electricity generators. In the meantime, pursuant to the new Electricity Act in force from January 1, 2008, administrative pricing for electricity generators was subsequently abolished. The ICSID arbitration panel issued the final determination on September 23, 2010 pursuant to which AES claim was dismissed. AES is in the process of analyzing the determination and the potential legal remedies. In 2008, Hungary introduced a special tax to be levied on energy companies including companies such as AES Tisza. The rate of the special tax was 8% and, in 2010, was extended until 2013. Hungary also introduced a further tax on certain industries, including energy companies (the Crisis Tax). The rate of the Crisis Tax for energy companies is 1.05% of the net sales revenues. Spain Structure of Electricity Market. Spain is a member of the EU and, as such, the Spanish Government has been taking steps to liberalize the countrys electricity sector in accordance with EU directives. Since January 1, 2003, all customers have been eligible to choose their electricity supplier. AES currently operates and holds a 71% ownership interest in a 1,199 MW natural gas fired plant located in Cartagena on the southeast coast of Spain. The plant sells energy into the Pan Iberian electricity market (MIBEL). The MIBEL market was created in January 2004 when Spain and Portugal signed a formal agreement. This new market allows generators in the two countries to sell their electricity on both sides of the Spanish Portuguese border as one single market. OMEL, Spains energy market operator and Portugals equivalent, OMIP, exchanged stakes in April 2006, and were reorganized such that an electricity forwards market was created in Lisbon and a spot market was created in Madrid. The main transmission company, Red El&eacute;ctrica de Espa&ntilde;a (REE), owns 99% of the 400 kV grid and 98% of the 220 kV network. The law has been changed to ensure that REE will become the sole transmission company in Spain. REE is also the system operator and is responsible for technical management of the system and for monitoring transmission. Under the countrys energy infrastructure plan, REE plans to invest in strengthening the mainland grid, connecting new plants and improving interconnection throughout the country. In due course, AES Cartagena entered into an agreement with REE for the construction of the interconnection facilities. The use of such facilities is the subject of another standard regulated contract stating the specific terms and conditions of access. Principal Regulations. On December 23, 2010, the Spanish Government implemented the RDL 14/2010 which, among other things, limits the numbers of hours and amount of feed in tariff available for photovoltaic power plants. The law that was passed on December 23, 2010 forms part of the governments policy aimed at rationalizing and delimiting the legally regulated costs in the electricity network, while searching for new sources of income and protecting the most vulnerable consumers. It is the latest law of those passed in the legislative year of 2010. Companies will finance the Bono Social (income based subsidy) until 2013 and they will assume the costs involved in the energy savings and efficiency policies for the period of 2011 2013. 49 Table of Contents All the companies generating electrical power, both those that operate under the ordinary regime as well as those related to renewable energy and cogeneration, will be paying an access tariff that amounts to 0.50/MWh. The hours that are entitled to premiums in the power plants using photovoltaic technology will be limited for a period of three years and in addition, a further cap on hours is introduced for the duration of the FIT scheme as is the case in the other sectors using wind powered and thermo solar technology. The maximum limits for the tariff deficit in 2010, 2011 and 2012 have been amended to better adapt to the deviations that arose, and the year 2013 has been kept as the point in time when self sufficiency will be reached with regard to tariffs. This Decree could have a material impact on AES Cartagena and AES Solars business in Spain. In September 2002, the Spanish Cabinet approved a ten year energy plan which focuses on meeting the countrys future energy requirements. The plan also reflects reliance on renewable energy sources and cogeneration. The Spanish electricity system has seen a steady increase in the new generation capacity from renewable energy sources for many years, particularly as a result of attractive feed in tariffs (approved by Royal Decree 661/207). Solar photovoltaic installed capacity in the region is estimated at 3.8 GW. The increase in renewable energy generation capacity supported by generous feed in tariffs has led to major changes in the regulations with the aim of reducing the total cost of the feed in tariffs for the Spanish electricity system. Partly as a result of that and also as a result of the tariff deficit already accumulated, Royal Decree Law 6/2009 has introduced new measures that affect AES Cartagena. Primarily, the creation of a new obligation on AES Cartagena (and certain other generation companies) requires them to pay for a portion of the cost of providing a social subsidy to groups of economically vulnerable electricity consumers. The liability for this cost, under the AES Cartagena Energy Agreement, is currently the subject of a dispute with the Energy Manager, which has been referred to arbitration. In February 2006, Spain introduced a law (Article 2 of Royal Decree Law 3/2006), which became effective March 2, 2006, that an amount equivalent to the value of the CO2 emission allowances allocated free of charge to electricity generators will be netted from electricity sales proceeds obtained by Ordinary Regime electricity generation such as the AES Cartagena plant. The parties obliged to pay these sums are the owners of generation facilities. For the years 2008, 2009, and 2010 the number of CO2 credits required to be surrendered by AES Cartagena under the ETS has been greater than the number of free credits allocated to it. Liability, under the AES Cartagena Energy Agreement, for the cost of the shortfall in CO2 emissions credits is currently in dispute, and is also the subject of the above mentioned arbitration proceedings. For a further discussion see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The Spanish Government implemented Orders (Order ITC/3315/2007, introduced on December 15, 2007, and Orders ITC/1721/2009 and ITC/1722/2009, introduced on June 26, 2009) which developed the principles set out in Article 2 and set the rules applicable for 2006, 2007 and January 1, 2008 June 30, 2009, respectively. The effect of these legislative provisions is that all owners of Ordinary Regime generation facilities in Spain are required to pay sums equivalent to the value of the CO2 emissions allowances allocated free of charge for 2006, 2007, 2008 and the first six months of 2009. Liability, under the AES Cartagena Energy Agreement, for these costs is currently in dispute and is the subject of the above mentioned arbitration proceedings. For a further discussion see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. As for the periods after 2012, Directive 2003/87/EC establishes that power generation facilities will not be issued with allowances free of charge. On December 23, 2002, Cadastral Law 48/2002 was enacted, which created a new category of property identified as Special Real Estate. This, together with further legislative changes (i.e., Law 51/2002 and Law 16/2007), led to the Municipality of Cartagena increasing the relevant tax rate and the issuance by the Cadastral authorities of a new property value assessment on November 21, 2007, which resulted in an increase in the 50 Table of Contents amount of Spanish property tax that is payable by AES Cartagena in respect of the plant. Liability under the Energy Agreement for this increase in tax is currently in dispute and is the subject of the above mentioned arbitration proceedings. Turkey Structure of Electricity Market. The wholesale generation and distribution market in Turkey is primarily a bilateral market dominated by state owned entities. The state owned Electricity Generation Company (EUAS) and its subsidiaries comprise approximately 24 GW of generation capacity and represent approximately 48% of the market. Private producers (with public offtake) account for another 35%, and auto producers and merchant power plants the remaining 17%. Principal Regulators. The transmission network is owned and controlled by TEIAS, the State Transmission Company. TETAS, the Wholesale Trading Company, sets wholesale prices based on average procurement costs from EUAS, auto producers and Build Operate/Build Own Transfer/Transfer of Operating Rights producers. This wholesale price represents the buying price for 21 distribution companies. Under TEDAS, there were 20 regional distribution companies. In 2006, four of them were privatized and transferred to the new owners in 2008. Another five of them have been privatized in 2009 and transferred to the new owners in 2010. In 2010, the remaining ones were privatized and are awaiting approval for handover. In 2010, the Turkish Privatization Administration finished privatizing all regional distribution companies. There is also an hourly balancing spot market, with prices typically differing from hour to hour, which is growing and has a capacity of 50 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of daily trade. The automatic price mechanism, which is meant to halt the government subsidization, has been approved and implementation commenced in July 2008. With this mechanism, all major cost items (foreign exchange, gas price increases, inflation, among others) are expected to be reflected in the tariff. As a result, mid term market wholesale prices are expected to converge to the current spot market prices. Distribution companies can procure 80 90% of their needs from TETAS and EUAS, but can also source up to 10 20% from other sources. Additionally, eligible customers, using greater than 100 MWh annually, can contract with the private wholesale companies and private power plants. Retail electricity prices are calculated and proposed by the distribution companies and then approved by the electricity market regulatory authority, EMRA. Environmental Regulations. Turkey has introduced a renewable feed in tariff that sets a floor for renewable generation (geothermal, wind and small scale hydro) for the first ten years of operation. The floor is between 0.050 and 0.055 per kWh and decreed by EMRA each year. AES Turkey hydro assets fall under the renewable feed in tariffs. The Turkish Government has also announced plans to privatize all the state owned generation assets, other than certain large hydro electric plants, in 2011. Ukraine Structure of Electricity Market. The electricity sector in Ukraine is regulated by the National Energy Regulatory Commission (NERC). Electricity costs to end users in Ukraine consist of three main components: (1) the wholesale market tariff is the price at which the distributor purchases energy on the wholesale market, (2) the distribution tariff covers the cost of transporting electricity over the distribution network, and (3) the supply tariff covers the cost of supplying electricity to an end user. The total cost permitted by the regulator under the distribution and supply tariff each year is referred to as the DVA. The distribution and supply tariffs for all distribution companies in Ukraine are established by the NERC on an annual basis, at which time DVA and electricity distribution volumes in the tariff are adjusted. A change in the DVA methodology was effected at the end of 2007 with respect to the treatment of wages and salaries such that the adjustment for inflation was replaced by an allowance based on the average industrial wage in the country and normative quantity of personnel. 51 Table of Contents Principal Regulations. In 2006, NERC authorized two 25% increases in end user tariffs for residential customers. Since 2006, there have been no further changes in residential end user tariffs. In 2010, the level of end user residential tariff covered approximately 30% of real energy costs. A moratorium on end user tariff increases was introduced by Presidential decree for non residential customers, effective from December 1, 2008, which resulted in the freezing of retail tariffs for the greater part of 2009. In 2010, the retail tariffs have slightly increased but legally the moratorium is still in force. The wholesale electricity market price increased by 49% in 2008, by 8.5% in 2009, and by 18% in 2010. In the course of 2010, a simultaneous increase in wholesale market price and pressure on the end user tariff growth resulted in an increase of the debt to distribution companies by NERC on compensation of losses for supplying energy to residential customers at privileged tariffs. A comprehensive review of the distribution tariff methodology addressing issues of revaluation of the rate base, operational expenses coverage on tariffs, the rate of return and introduction of regulatory incentives to increase the quality of service was initially expected to take place at the end of 2008. However, since late 2008 and then on an annual basis, NERC has been introducing minimal changes into the tariff methodology to be valid for just one year, including for 2010, setting the rate of return on initial investment at the level of 15% after tax, wages and salaries treatment remaining as per the mechanism introduced in 2007, and material operational expenses subject to indexation by inflation. A similar extension of provisions for 2011 has been effected in late 2010. Development and approval of a comprehensive methodology is expected to take place during 2011 to be introduced in 2012. In 2010, the President of Ukraine announced the list of reforms for implementation up through 2014 in all sectors of the economy, including the electric industry. According to such reforms, there are plans to (i) develop new tariff methodology in 2011; (ii) increase tariffs for residential customers; (iii) commence elimination of cross subsidies; (iv) make changes to legislation to improve customers payment discipline; (v) privatize state owned distribution companies and generation companies; and (vi) introduce a new market structure based on bilateral agreements and balancing market, etc. In 2009, the Supreme Court of Ukraine took a preliminary position affecting distribution companies in the Ukraine, including AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo, whereunder it required that certain network commercial losses of power that were previously treated as tax deductible could no longer be treated as such. This position, if maintained, may have a material effect on AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo. The Company expects that the Supreme Court of Ukraine may clarify its position in 2011, and the proceedings in respect to AES Kievoblenergo and AES Rivneoblenergo are not likely to be finally resolved for another several years. United Kingdom Structure of Electricity Market. On March 21, 2007, the Electricity (Single Wholesale Market) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007 was enacted, which provided for the introduction and regulation of a single wholesale electricity market (the SEM) for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that began operation in November of 2007. Revenue from the SEM includes a regulated capacity and an energy payment based on the system marginal price. Bidding principles insist bids are cost reflective and are based on short run marginal cost. Total annual capacity payments are calculated as the product of the annualized fixed cost of a best new entrant peaking plant multiplied by the capacity required to meet the security standard. This accumulated capacity is then distributed on the basis of plant availability throughout the year on a per trading period basis. Certain generating units (Kilroot GTs 1 and 2 and Ballylumford units 4, CCGT units 10 & 20 and GTs 1 and 2) are contracted under long term PPAs to NIE Energy Limited terminating on various dates. The CCGT units are subject to extension by NIEE between March 2012 and 2024. All of the PPAs can be cancelled under direction from NIAUR from November 1, 2010 with six months notice other than the Ballylumford 10 and 20 units which can be cancelled from April 1, 2012. All other units (Kilroot units K1 and K2 whose PPAs terminated in November 2010, GTs 3 and 4 and Ballylumford units 5 and 6) participate as merchant units in the SEM as described above. 52 Table of Contents The effect of this on the Northern Ireland units operated as merchant plants in the SEM depends largely on the relative costs of coal and gas. The relevant units receive capacity payments under the SEM. For the units with PPAs in place, Kilroot and Ballylumford are neutral with respect to the cost of fuel as this is passed through to its PPA counterparty as an element of the payments made to the respective units based on their availability. Principal Regulators. Kilroot and Ballylumford are located in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and are subject to regulation by the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR). Principal Regulations. The principal legislation is The Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992 under which the Generation Licenses of Kilroot and Ballylumford are granted. Environmental Regulations. The Kilroot and Ballylumford plants operate under permits granted under the Pollution Prevention Control Regulations (NI) 2003. The Industrial Emissions Directive was approved by the European Parliament on July 7, 2010 and is expected to become law by 2014. The Directive sets stricter limits on the emissions of pollutants such as NOX, SO2 and particulate and requires further reductions in such emissions by January 2016. The combined package of the Industrial Emission Directive, National Emissions Ceiling Directive and Best Available Technique requirements forms a Regulatory Framework for all electricity generation Large Combustion Plants for the period from 2016 onwards, principally comprising coal fired, gas fired, oil fired and biomass fired plants. The following steps may be required in respect of Kilroot: (i) fit selective catalytic reduction and comply with the new limits by 2023, at which time there may be another review; (ii) opt out and run under a limited life derogation for a maximum of 17,500 hours; and (iii) opt into a Transitional National Plan which shall apply from January 1, 2016 until June 30, 2020 then option to comply with Emission Limit Values or Closure. Currently, the Ballylumford units 4, 5 and 6 (the B Station) are scheduled to close by the end of 2015 under the Large Combustion Plant Directive; however, there is the possibility that these units may be adapted to be compliant under the Industrial Emissions Directive. The exact detail will not be known until the Industrial Emissions Directive is implemented. With regard to the C Station at Ballylumford, gas turbines using light oils and middle distillates as liquid fuels shall be subject to an emission limit value for NOX of 90mg/Nm3. GT10 (part of the CCGT plant) is currently permitted to 120mg/m3 on distillate. This could mean that possible modifications are required to be able to continue to run distillate as a dual fuel. It is expected that there will be transitionary arrangements within the Directive to allow plants to manage the introduction of the new limits and it has been suggested that large combustion plants may have until July 2020 to meet the requirements. The option appears attractive to AES and would allow the units to operate without substantial capital investment on a restricted load factor until the end of 2020. After 2020, AES would be required to comply with the new emissions limits in order to continue operations. The Environmental Liability Directive came into force in Northern Ireland on June 24, 2009 and is aimed at the prevention and remedying of environmental damage. An operator will be held financially liable if is carries out certain activities which cause environmental damage, or where there is an imminent threat of such damage, regardless of whether it intended to cause the damage or was negligent. This includes IPPC permitted installations. In practice there should be no real change to AES operations as a result of the coming into force of this Directive. Material Regulatory Actions. On November 25, 2009, the NIAUR published a Consultation Paper on Relevant Considerations in Relation to the Possible Cancellation of Generating Unit Agreements in Northern 53 Table of Contents Ireland which is relevant to various long term PPAs in Northern Ireland including those at Kilroot and Ballylumford. On April 30, 2010, NIAUR made notification to Kilroot that it intended to exercise the early cancellation provisions of the GUAs for the main coal units (K1 and K2) effective November 1, 2010. The formal cancellation notices were received on October 28, 2010 instructing NIEE to cancel the GUAs for units K1 and K2 effective November 1, 2010. All remaining units remain contracted but are kept under review. Units K1 and K2 fully operate within the SEM (as mentioned above). Potential or Proposed Regulations. In November 2010, the Council of the EU approved a revised directive on industrial emissions so as to reduce emissions of pollutants that are harmful to the environment and associated with cancer, asthma and acid rain. The industrial emissions directive seeks to prevent and control air, water and soil pollution by industrial installations. It regulates emissions of a wide range of pollutants, including sulphur and nitrogen compounds, dust particles, asbestos and heavy metals. The directive is aimed at improving local air, water and soil quality, not at mitigating the global warming effects of some of these substances. The review integrates seven directives into a single legal Framework and provides for a more harmonized and rigorous implementation of emissions limits associated with the cleanest available technology, so called BAT. Deviations from this standard are only permitted where local and technical characteristics would make it disproportionately costly. The recast also tightens emission limits for NOX, SO2 and dust from power plants and large combustion installations in oil refineries and the metal industry. New plants must apply the cleanest available technology from 2012, four years earlier than initially proposed. Existing plants have to comply with this standard from 2016, though a transition period is foreseen. Until June 30, 2020, member states may define transitional plans with declining annual caps for NOX, SO2 or dust emissions. Where installations are already scheduled to close by the end of 2023 or operate less than 17,500 hours after 2016, they may not need to upgrade. Member States have two years to transpose the Directive. Middle East & Asia China In 2005, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) released interim regulations governing on grid tariffs, along with two other regulations governing transmission and retail tariffs. The On Grid Tariff Measures specify different rules for the determination of on grid tariffs before and after the implementation of competitive pricing. Before the implementation of competitive pricing, the on grid tariffs shall be appraised and ratified by the pricing authorities by reference to the economic life of power generation projects and determined in accordance with the principle of allowing IPPs to cover reasonable costs and to obtain reasonable returns. Such costs were defined to be the average costs in the industry and reasonable returns will be calculated on the basis of the interest rate of Chinas long term Treasury bond plus certain percentage points. After the establishment of competitive regional power markets, the on grid tariffs of electricity generation companies which participate in the competitive market shall principally consist of two components: the capacity charge, which is to be determined by the tariff regulatory authority, and the energy charge, which is to be determined by market competition. However, no implementation rules have been issued to introduce the competitive pricing. The Retail Tariff Measures aim to reform the various classes of tariff for end users into three categories: residential electricity, electricity used in agricultural production and electricity used in industry, commerce or for other purposes. The tariff for each category is fixed per voltage class. The tariffs shall be determined with consideration to the fair sharing of the burden, the efficient adjustment of the demand for electricity and the public policy objectives. In addition to the foregoing tariff setting mechanism, Chinas central government also issued a tariff adjustment policy allowing the on grid tariffs to be pegged to the fuel price in the case of significant fluctuations in fuel price. Seventy percent of the increase in fuel costs may be passed through in the tariff. The tariffs of coal fired facilities in China were increased in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 pursuant to this policy to alleviate the escalation of fuel price; however, such adjustments were obtained from the regulatory authorities only after a time lag and fell short of compensating all businesses for coal price increases in recent years. There was no catch up tariff adjustment in 2010 pursuant to the foregoing policy. 54 Table of Contents Pursuant to the Renewable Energy Law of China, which came into effect on January 1, 2006 and was amended on December 26, 2009, renewable resources such as wind, solar, biomass, geo thermal and hydro enjoy complete and unrestricted generation and dispatch, and local grid interconnection is mandated to such plants. To implement the Renewable Energy Law, on August 2, 2007, various central government agencies jointly issued the Temporary Measures for Dispatching Electricity Generated by Energy Conservation Projects. Under this regulation, power plants are categorized into various groups and each group will, under certain circumstances, enjoy priority dispatch over the subsequent groups. The first group is renewable energy power plants, namely wind, hydro, solar, biomass, tidal wave, geo thermal and landfill gas power plants that satisfy certain environmental standards. The second group is nuclear power plants. The third group is power plants using modern coal which includes cogeneration power plants, and power plants utilizing residual heat, residual gas, coal gangue (or waste coal) and coal mine methane. The last three groups are natural gas, conventional coal and oil fired power plants. As a result, power plants using renewable resources will enjoy priority dispatch over power plants using fossil fuels. The amendment to the Renewable Energy Law requires that the local grid companies abide by the periodic targets developed by the government on the proportion of power to be generated by renewable energy sources as compared to the total electricity generation and to purchase the entire amount of electricity generated by renewable resources. This is in line with the requirement that renewable energy power plants will enjoy unrestricted generation and dispatch under the Renewable Energy Law, as well as the Chinese governments policy objective to encourage comprehensive utilization of resources in an energy efficient and environmentally friendly manner. In 2007, the Chinese government issued a number of rules and procedures that govern the shutdown of small coal or oil fired power plants. The types of plants to be shut down include: (i) power plants with a capacity under 50 MW; (ii) power plants with a capacity of up to 100 MW which are over 20 years old; (iii) power plants with a capacity of up to 200 MW whose equipment has reached the end of its useful life; and (iv) power plants that have coal consumption rates that are higher than either 10% above the applicable provincial average or 15% above the national average. The shutdown procedures have been set in place to ensure that certain smaller power plants are appropriately shut down and replaced by larger and more efficient power plants. The purpose of such rules and regulations is again in accordance with Chinas policy to achieve energy conservation and emissions reductions. China Power International Holdings Ltd., our joint venture partner in Wuhu IV, intended to construct and develop a 2x600 MW coal fired power plant. According to this policy and the ratification for the unit of Wuhu V needs to obtain the corresponding closing and shut down capacity. After consultation among all shareholders of Wuhu IV, the shareholders, including AES, agreed to transfer their respective shares to the owner of Wuhu V and to shut down Wuhu IV. The consideration for the sale of our 25% share in Wuhu IV is Renminbi 50 million ($7.6 million). The deal is expected to be closed by the end of March 2011. On July 20, 2009, NDRC issued the Circular on Refining the Policy for On Grid Pricing of Wind Power (NDRC Price 2009 No. 1906), which introduces a benchmark system for on grid tariffs for wind power replacing the existing public bidding and concession model for wind projects. The circular provides that on grid tariffs for onshore wind power projects approved from August 1, 2009 onwards are fixed using a centrally controlled price determination mechanism, while on grid tariffs for offshore wind projects will be determined separately. Under the circular, Chinas onshore area is divided into four different types of wind power resource regions, and different prices are set for each of these regions ranging from 0.51 yuan/kWh (US cent 7.5/kWh) for wind power in regions with the best wind resources, such as Inner Mongolia, to 0.61 yuan/kWh (US cent 8.9/kWh) for regions with the worst wind resources. According to NDRC, the legislations intent is to standardize the wind power price regulation and promote healthy and sustainable development of the wind power industry. Currently, we do not expect that this newly issued circular will have a material adverse impact on our wind power businesses in China. India Structure of Electricity Market. Pursuant to reforms by the Government of India, including enactment of the Electricity Act of India (EAI), the electricity market in India is moving towards a multi buyer, multi seller system as opposed to the past structure which permitted a single buyer to purchase power from power generators. 55 Table of Contents This legal and regulatory framework provides flexibility in granting electricity regulatory commissions freedom in determining tariffs as well as encouraging competition with regulatory intervention. Transmission, distribution and trade of electricity remain regulated activities which require licenses from an electricity regulatory commission, unless exempted. The Central Government, through the Ministry of Power, is involved in the power sector planning, policy formulation and appointment of central regulators. State governments also have powers to appoint or remove members of the State Regulatory Commissions. The state governments set up and notify the state load dispatch center. Under the EAI, the state governments are required to unbundle the State Electricity Boards into separate generation, distribution and transmission companies. Principal Regulators. Indias power sector is regulated by a two level regulatory system: at the national level, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC); and at the state level, the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERC) (together the Regulatory Commissions). CERC regulates tariffs of generating stations owned by the Central Government, or those involved in generating in more than one State, and regulating interstate transmission of electricity. SERC regulates intra state transmission and supply of electricity within each state. While discharging functions under the EAI, regulatory commissions are guided by the National Electricity Policy, the Tariff Policy and the National Electricity Plan and directions on any policy involving public interest issued by the Central Government or state government. Regulatory Commissions are quasi judicial authorities entrusted with various functions including determining tariffs, granting licensees and settling disputes between the generating companies and the licensees, and between licensees. An Appellate Tribunal has been set up for appeal against orders of Regulatory Commissions. The Appellate Tribunal has quasi judicial powers to summon, enforce attendance, require discovery, receive evidence and review decisions. The orders of the Appellate Tribunal are executable as decrees of a civil court and can be challenged in the Supreme Court. Principal Regulations. In 2003, the Government of India enacted the EAI to establish a framework for a multi seller/multi buyer model for the electricity industry, introducing significant changes to Indias electricity sector. The EAI is a central unified legislation relating to generation, transmission, distribution trading and use of electricity that replaced multiple legislations. Pursuant to the EAI, the Government of India ratified the National Electricity Policy in 2005 and the National Tariff Policy in 2006. The policies established deadlines to implement different provisions of the EAI. However, the pace of actual implementation of the reform process is contingent on the respective state governments and SERCs, as electricity is a concurrent subject in Indias constitution. There is no license required to set up generation plants under the EAI and generators are allowed to sell to state utilities, traders and open access consumers. The access to consumers is subject to regulatory provisions on transmission corridor availability and payment of cross subsidy surcharge. The Central Government ratified the National Electricity Policy in 2005, which includes the following objectives: access to electricity for all households; availability of power demand to be met by 2012; energy and peaking shortages to be overcome and adequate spinning reserve to be available; supply of reliable and quality power of specified standards in an efficient manner and at reasonable rates; per capita availability of electricity to be increased to over 1,000 units by 2012; financial turnaround and the commercial viability of electricity sector; and the protection of consumers interests. The Policy for setting up of Mega Power Projects was ratified by the Ministry of Power in 1995, and has been revised from time to time. Conditions required to be fulfilled by a developer for the grant of Mega Power Project status include a thermal power plant with a capacity of 700 MW or more located in the States of Jammu & Kashmir, the north eastern states of India; a thermal power plant of a capacity of 1,000 MW or more located in States other than those specified above; a hydro electricity power plant of a capacity of 350 MW or more located in the States of Jammu & Kashmir, the northeastern states of India; or a hydro electricity power plant of a capacity of 500 MW or more located in states other than those specified above. Mega Power Projects would be required to secure long term PPAs with distribution companies in accordance with the National Electricity Policy 2005 and the National Tariff Policy 2006, as amended from time to time. Fiscal concessions available to the Mega Power Projects include the import of capital equipment free of customs duty and export benefits are available to domestic bidders for projects under both public and private sectors after meeting certain requirements. Capital goods required for setting up any mega power project qualify for the above 56 Table of Contents fiscal benefits after it is certified that: (i) the power purchasing states have granted to the Regulatory Commissions full powers to fix tariffs; (ii) the power purchasing states undertake, in principle, to privatize distribution in all cities, in that state, which has a population of more than one million, within a period to be fixed by the Ministry of Power; and (iii) the income tax holiday regime as per Section 80 IA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is also available. The EAI specifies trading in electricity as a licensed activity. The license for electricity trading is required to be obtained from the relevant regulatory commission. In 2009, CERC issued regulations for the grant of trading licenses to regulate the interstate trading of electricity. Trading license regulations set out qualifications for the grant of the license including technical and professional qualifications and net worth requirements. Licensees are subject to conditions specifying, among other things the extent of trading margin, maintenance of records and a requirement to pay a license fee, as specified by CERC. The Regulatory Commissions have the right to fix a ceiling on trading margins in intra state trading. Two power exchanges have received licenses from CERC and have started operations. The volume of power trading on the power exchanges is short term as the bulk of power is still traded through long term bilateral contracts. Environmental Regulations. Compliance with relevant environmental laws is the responsibility of the occupier or operator of the facilities. Principal regulations include the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (EPAct), an umbrella legislation of environmental protection laws. The EPAct vests the Government of India with the power to take measures it deems necessary for protecting and improving the quality of the environment and preventing and controlling environmental pollution. This includes rules for the quality of the environment, standards for emission of discharge of environmental pollutants from various sources and inspection of any premises, plant, equipment, machinery, and materials likely to cause pollution. Penalties for violation of the EPAct include fines or imprisonment. Environment Impact Assessment Notification S.O. 1533(E), 2006 issued under the EPAct and the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, mandate prior approval by the Ministry of Environment & Forests or State Environment Impact Assessment Authority for establishing a new project or expansion or modernization of existing projects. Projects that require preparation of an environment impact assessment report involve public consultation and hearings. Pursuant thereto, the appropriate authority makes an appraisal of the project after a final environment impact assessment report is submitted addressing the questions raised in the public consultation process. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 (the Water Cess Act) mandates levy and collection of a tax on water consumed by industries calculated on the basis of the amount of water consumed for any of the purposes specified under the Water Cess Act. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 (the Air Act) requires an industrial plant to obtain consent of the State Pollution Control Board (Board). Similarly, The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (the Water Act) provides provisions for making an application to the Board for establishing an industry which may cause effluent discharge into water bodies. The Board may impose conditions relating to pollution control equipment to be installed at the facilities. Industrial plants in any air pollution control area are not permitted to discharge emissions/air pollutants in excess of the standards laid by the Board. Under the Air Act and the Water Act, the Central Pollution Control Board has powers to specify standards for quality of air, while State Boards have powers to inspect any control equipment, industrial plant or manufacturing process. Material Regulatory Actions. The Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC) is empowered to determine tariffs for supply of electricity by a generating company to a distribution licensee, transmission of electricity, wheeling of electricity and retail sale of electricity. In case of a shortage of supply of electricity, the ERC may fix the minimum and maximum tariff ceiling for sale or purchase of electricity for a period not exceeding one year to ensure reasonable prices of electricity. While determining tariffs, the ERC follows principles and methodologies specified by the CERC for determination of tariffs, including the principle that generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity should be conducted on commercial principles and takes into account factors which encourage competition, efficiency and economical use of resources. The EAI provides that the ERC will adopt such tariffs determined through a transparent process of bidding in accordance with guidelines issued by the Central Government. The Central Government, through the Ministry 57 Table of Contents of Power, has issued guidelines for competitive bidding and draft documentation (PPAs) for competitively bid projects. The determination of tariffs for a power project depends on the mode of participation in the project. Tariffs may be determined in two ways: (i) based on tariff principles prescribed by CERC, i.e., cost plus basis consisting of a capacity charge, an energy charge, an unscheduled interchange charge and incentive payments; or (ii) a competitive bidding process where the tariff is purely market based. The ERC is required to adopt a bid based tariff, although the Guidelines for Determination of Tariff by Bidding Process for Procurement of Power by Distribution Licensees, 2005 (Bidding Guidelines) permit the bidding authority to reject all price bids received. The Bidding Guidelines recommend bid evaluation on the basis of levelized tariff and include two types of bids: Case I bids, where the location, technology and fuel is not specified by the procurers, i.e., the generating company has the freedom to choose the site and the technology for the power plant; and Case II bids, where the projects are location specific and fuel specific. Tariff rates for procurement of electricity by distribution licensees can be for long term procurement of electricity for a period of seven years and above; or medium term procurement for a period of up to seven years but exceeding one year. For long term procurement under tariff bidding guidelines, a two stage process is adopted for the bid process and includes a request for qualification and request for proposal. The procurer may adopt a single stage tender process for medium term procurement, combining the request for qualification and request for proposal processes. Under this route, IPPs can bid at two parameters, i.e., the fixed or capacity charge or the variable or energy charge, which comprises the fuel cost for the electricity generated. The bidders are usually permitted to quote a base price and an acceptable escalation formula. Bidding Guidelines include a two step process pre qualification and final bid. Bidders are required to submit a technical and financial bid at the RFP stage. Power purchase and distribution licenses are increasing through the competitive bid route. The Tariff Policy requires all procurement of power after January 6, 2006 (except for PPAs approved or submitted for approval before January 6, 2006 or projects which have obtained financing prior to January 6, 2006) by distribution licensees to be through competitive bidding. Some state regulators have ratified the purchase of power under memorandums of understanding, on the ground that the tariff policy discussed above is merely indicative and not binding. Kazakhstan Structure of Electricity Market. In Kazakhstan, the electricity sector is divided into wholesale and retail markets. The wholesale electricity market of Kazakhstan is based on bilateral contracts conducted through an over the counter market and KOREMs centralized trading system. In the retail market, the power distribution and supply functions are unbundled and retail customers with consumption of one MW or more have a right to buy the electricity directly from power plants or retail supply companies. Principal Regulators. The Government of Kazakhstan approves subordinate acts in the power sector (licensing requirement, technical regulations, market rules, tariff methodologies for natural monopolies, etc.) and determines the level of price caps for groups of power plants. The Ministry of Industry and New Technologies (the Ministry) is the central executive body responsible for developing state policy in the power sector and conducting technical regulation. As a part of price cap regulation, the Ministry is responsible for determining groups of power companies for each price cap, annual adjustments of price caps and signing agreements on investment obligations with power plants. The Agency for Regulation of Natural Monopolies (the Regulator) acts as a regulator of industries considered to be natural monopolies (transmission and distribution of oil, gas, electricity and heat, railroads, airports, etc.). In the power industry, the Regulator is responsible for the approval of tariffs for heat generation, distribution and supply, electricity transmission and distribution as well as end user tariffs for dominant companies in the retail power market. The Regulator grants different licenses in the power sector such as licenses for generation, distribution and retail activities. The Agency for Protection of Competition (the AZK) monitors power market participants to determine entities with a dominant position and detect violations of antimonopoly legislation. 58 Table of Contents The Ministry of Environmental Protection (the Environmental Ministry) is responsible for environmental policy, grants emissions permits and evaluates the environmental impact of new projects. JSC KEGOC is a state owned electricity transmission company, which also acts as the system operator with a central dispatch management function and as the operator of the balancing market. Principal Regulations. The following major laws and regulations govern the electricity industry: Law On the Power Industry (the Kazakhstan Electricity law); Law On Natural Monopolies and Regulated Markets; Law On Competition; Law On Supporting the Use of Renewable Energy Sources; Environmental Code; Law On Licensing; Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan On Approval of the Price Caps; and The state program of power industry development in 2010 2014. Continuous changes in the law and regulations result in contradictions between different laws and regulations. This in turn results in an uncertain regulatory environment in the power sector. The key elements of price cap regulation of power plants are as follows: (i) the Ministry has determined the power plant grouping based on the plant type, equipment, fuel and distance from coal mines (thirteen groups of power plants were defined); (ii) the Ministry has proposed to the government the price cap for each group based on actual prices in 2008 and the level of investment required and the government has approved price caps for each groups of power plants for the seven year period from 2009 2015; (iii) the Ministry may propose to the government additional annual adjustments to price caps to reflect inflation and investment requirements within any group or a power plant may apply for an individual investment tariff to the Ministry and the Regulator; (iv) a power plant determines its investment obligations at its own discretion and signs an agreement with the Ministry on investment obligations; and (v) the price cap and individual investment tariff regime does not constitute a price guarantee and power plants should sell to consumers at the competitive market price but not higher than their group price cap or an individual investment tariff. Only exports of power and sale of ten percent of generation through a centralized trading system are exempt from this restriction. Power trading activities are restricted and power plants are allowed to conduct trading activities to provide electricity supply to their consumers during emergency shutdowns. The Regulator approves and regulates all tariffs for heat generation, transmission and supply, as well as electricity transmission and distribution tariffs on a cost based methodology. Power trading companies, which the AZK considers dominant entities, must notify the Regulator of any proposed increase in their tariffs and the Regulator has the right to veto such proposed tariff increases. Furthermore, the Regulator has the right to request a decrease in the applicable tariffs. The AZK determines the borders of electricity markets at its own discretion, which does not correspond with the provisions of the Kazakhstan Electricity Law, and designates entities with dominant market power. The AZK may consider the tariff of a power plant which is in compliance with price cap regulation to be an excessive monopolistic price of a dominant entity and impose sanctions, as happens from time to time to AES generating companies. Environmental regulations. The Environmental Ministry is responsible for environmental policy and environmental regulations. The Environmental Ministry issues environmental permits, sets emissions limits and 59 Table of Contents organizes ecological control in the forms of state environmental impact assessment and independent ecological audit. The Environmental Ministry reviews applications of power plants and, after conducting the environmental impact assessment, grants environmental permits for industrial waste, air and water pollutions for a period of not more than three years. Material Regulatory Actions. In December 2010, the Ministry refused to sign agreements on investment obligations with AES UK HPP and AES UK CHP for 2011 and has requested to amend the existing agreement on investment obligation from AES Shulbinsk HPP in 2011. The Ministry has demanded that AES power plants in Kazakhstan undertake an additional obligation to spend all profits in new investment projects. The absence of signed agreements on investment obligations may lead to further sanctions by the AZK and other state authorities against our businesses. The AREM has refused to grant a necessary tariff increase to the AES retail company Shygysenergotrade LLP for 2011. Contrary to applicable law, AREM is requesting that Shygysenergotrade LLP confirm the existence of agreements on investment obligations between the AES power plants and the Ministry as a condition for the right to purchase power at new price caps. Increased investment costs and or sanctions could have a material impact on these businesses, require additional capital investment, and may impact our results of operations. The AZK has designated all AES power plants in Kazakhstan as dominant entities in the Eastern Kazakhstan and Pavlodar regions. Shygysenergotrade LLP has also been designated by the AZK as a dominant entity in the Eastern Kazakhstan retail market. AES has challenged these designations but so far has been unsuccessful in having the designations overturned. The AZK is conducting other investigations into alleged violations by AES businesses in Kazakhstan of antimonopoly legislation such as excessive monopolistic prices and ungrounded refusal to supply power to certain customers. AES believes that the investigations per se and allegations made by the AZK in the course of investigations are without merits, and AES is vigorously challenging the unfounded actions of the AZK. However, if AES Kazakhstan does not prevail in these proceedings, there could be a material impact on these businesses and our results of operations. Potential or Proposed Regulations. The Ministry plans to introduce a capacity market starting in 2015 to support new investments in generating assets. The capacity market should replace price cap regulation. Details of the new regulations are not yet publicly available and the regulations are still under review by the government. The capacity market regulations could be unfavorable to our businesses in Kazakhstan and may have a material impact on our financial results. The Ministry and the Regulator have drafted amendments to the Kazakhstan Electricity Law to increase sanctions for any failure to implement the investment program or comply with the price cap regulation. The absence of a signed agreement on investment obligations will limit a power plants right to apply tariffs up to the price cap, such that the electricity tariff of a power plant cannot not exceed its 2008 level. It is expected that this regulation will come into force in 2011. As a result, we may be required to make significant capital investments and to incur other expenses in order to obtain the benefits of the price caps. The Regulator plans to introduce benchmarking tariff regulations for power distribution to be effective in 2013. The Environmental Ministry plans to amend the Ecological Code to introduce carbon regulation to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, which was ratified by Kazakhstan. According to the draft regulation, a power plant will receive carbon emissions allocations and a carbon trading system will be established. In addition, a violation of environmental legislation may lead to criminal liability and fines. Philippines Structure of Electricity Market. From a vertically integrated industry, the Philippines has unbundled its power sector into generation, transmission, distribution and supply. The enabling law for this restructuring is Republic Act No. 9136, otherwise known as the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA). The 60 Table of Contents EPIRA primarily aims to increase private sector participation in the power sector and to privatize the Governments generation and transmission assets. Generation and supply are open and competitive sectors, while transmission and distribution are regulated sectors. Sale of power is done primarily thorough medium term contracts between generation companies and customers specifying the volume, price and conditions for the sale of energy and capacity. The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) approves the said contracts for supply of energy. Power is also traded in the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) from which at least 10% of the distribution companies or electricity cooperatives power requirement must be sourced. A market optimization model determines the price and dispatch by processing the bids from trading participants and the system condition from the system operator. The market operator then comes out with a schedule of both price and energy which maximizes economic gains for participants subject to certain constraints. The dispatch schedule is then coordinated with the system operator for implementation. The market is operating under a gross pool, net settlement system, whereby each generator submits energy offers regardless of their contracted energy. However, the generator should declare their contracted quantities, since the market will not include contracted energy in its settlement. New contracts assigned by distribution companies for consumption after expiration are awarded to generation companies either through the lowest supply price offered in public bid processes or through a negotiated contract. The ERC then approves the said contract benchmarked against, among others, the prices of the best new entrant generation company. Except for its supply to MERALCO (the largest distribution company in the Philippines), to which it is allocated about 14.89% of the contract energy under the NPC Transition Supply Contract, all supply contracts of AES Masinloc are bilateral contracts already provisionally approved by the ERC. Principal Regulators. The ERC, created under the EPIRA, is mandated to protect long term consumer interest in terms of quality, reliability and reasonable pricing of sustainable supply of electricity. It is a quasi judicial body that promulgates and enforces rules, regulations, guidelines and policies. The Department of Energy is mandated to prepare, integrate, coordinate, supervise and control all plans, programs, projects and activities of the government relative to energy exploration, development, utilization, distribution and conservation. The DOE endorses new or existing generators. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources administers the system for evaluating the environmental impact of new or existing generating plants. Principal Regulations. The distinct electricity sector activities are regulated by the EPIRA. Sector activities are also governed by the corresponding technical regulations and standards, namely, the Philippine Grid Code, Philippine Distribution Code, Open Access Transmission Service Rules, WESM Rules, and Distribution System Open Access Rules (DSOAR).The keystones of the electricity regulation are: (i) performance based on revenue cap and non discriminatory access to transmission lines; (ii) a contract based supply and spot electricity trading for generation; (iii) performance based on maximum average price and non discriminatory access for DUs and ECs under the performance base rate regime; and (iv) electricity supply by distribution companies in their respective franchise areas. Section 31 of EPIRA establishes the Retail Competition and Open Access (RC&OA) under which Retail Electricity Suppliers, who are duly licensed by the ERC, may supply directly to Contestable Customers (end users with an average demand of at least 1,000 kW) with DUs and ECs providing non discriminatory wires services. Four of the five pre conditions for RC&OA have already been satisfied and the remaining condition for open access to commence is expected to be achieved next year. Actual RC&OA may commence six months after ERCs determination that all conditions have been satisfied. Environmental Regulations. The Renewable Energy Act of 2008 was enacted in December 2008 (R.A. 9513) R.A. 9513 promotes non conventional renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energies. The law requires that electric power participants to initially source 10% of their supply from eligible renewable energy resources. The initial requirement of 10% is preliminary, as the National Renewable Energy Board (NREB) has not decided on the final figure. It is also unknown at this time if the 61 Table of Contents definition of electric power participant applies to entities that are power producers or if it applies to power consumers. If and once the regulations are implemented, our businesses in the Philippines could be adversely impacted by having to source a portion of its generation from renewable energy resources to supply its customers contracts, which could in turn affect our results of operations. Under Section 6 of the said law, consumers are also given a green energy option which provides end users the option to choose renewable energy resources as their source of energy. Water rights are given by the National Water Resources Board under the Department of Environment and Natural Resource for extraction and discharge of water used in the operation of the Masinloc Plant. Material Regulatory Actions. Pending with the ERC is the decision for the approval of additional fees for AES Masinloc through a rate adjustment and currency exchange adjustment. The ERC previously ruled that NPC shall be responsible for any recovery/refund for both these recoveries for the transition period prior to the closing date for each company such as AES Masinloc which obtained facilities in the privatization. With the acquisition of the Masinloc, our business also acquired the right to supply the electricity requirement of various NPC customers pursuant to the Transition Supply Contracts entered into between NPC and those customers. In an Order on November 15, 2010, the ERC approved the refund for currency exchange recovery adjustment, covering the test period up to June 2009. Potential or Proposed Regulations. Section 72 of the EPIRA requires a mandated rate reduction from NPC rates. With the assignment of the Transition Supply Contracts to successor generating companies, such as AES Masinloc, NPCs position is that the mandated rate reduction shall be for the account of the successor generating companies. AES Masinloc filed a petition with ERC to initiate rule making and clarify the MRR implementation in light of the ongoing privatization of NPC plants. In its decision, the ERC ruled in favor of AES Masinloc, saying that the EPIRA mandated rate reduction shall be implemented by the successor generating company subject to the execution of a written instrument between NPC and the new generator specifically containing the assumption by the latter of such obligation. The ERC ruled in favor of AES Masinloc since there was no such written instrument. NPC filed a petition for review with the Court asking for a reversal of the said ERC decision. The case is pending with the Court of Appeals. If AES Masinloc loses this matter on appeal, it may be subject to the rate reduction described above, which could have a material impact on its business and our results of operations. A similar mandated rate reduction case is pending with the ERC. MERALCO alleges that AES Masinloc failed to account for the rate reduction in MERALCOs favor amounting to Php179,611,458.98 ($4.1 million). It is assumed that the ERC will wait for the decision of the first matter described in the preceding paragraph before ruling on the MERALCO case since the latter is particularly dependent on the outcome of the pending petition with the Court of Appeals. Environmental and Land Use Regulations Overview. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential greenhouse gas (GHG) legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOX, particulate matter, mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries, and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies, and Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in this Form 10 K. 62 Table of Contents Many of the countries in which the Company does business also have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting, ownership, operation, modification, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from electric power generation or distribution assets. In addition, international projects funded by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many other international lenders are subject to World Bank environmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country standards. The Company often has used advanced environmental technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, including circulating fluidized bed (CFB) coal technologies, flue gas desulphurization technologies, selective catalytic reduction technologies and advanced gas turbines. Environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Expenditures in this Form 10 K for more detail. If these regulations change or the enforcement of these regulations becomes more rigorous, the Company and its subsidiaries may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company would be able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would not be materially adversely affected. Various licenses, permits and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmental laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expenditures, interruptions or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to litigation or regulatory action relating to environmental permits or approvals. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including a Notice of Violation (NOV) issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency against IPL concerning new source review and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the United States Clean Air Act. Greenhouse Gas Laws, Protocols and Regulations. In 2010, the Companys subsidiaries operated electric power generation businesses which had total approximate direct CO2 emissions of 77.2 million metric tonnes, approximately 40 million metric tonnes of which were emitted in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by the The Greenhouse Gas Protocol reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. The following is an overview of both the regulations and laws that currently apply to our businesses and those that may be imposed over the next few years. Such regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on the electric power generation and distribution businesses of the Companys subsidiaries and on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. International In July 2003, the European Community Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading was created, which requires member states to limit emissions of CO2 from large industrial sources within their countries. To do so, member states are required to implement EC approved national allocation plans (NAPs). Under the NAPs, member states are responsible for allocating limited CO2 allowances within their borders. Directive 2003/87/EC does not dictate how these allocations are to be made, and NAPs that have been submitted thus far have varied in their allocation methodologies. For these and other reasons, uncertainty remains with respect to the implementation of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) that commenced in January 2005. The European Union has announced that it intends to keep the EU ETS in place after 2012, even if the Kyoto Protocol is not extended or replaced by another agreement. The Companys subsidiaries operate eight electric power generation facilities, and another subsidiary has one under construction, within six member states which have adopted NAPs to implement Directive 2003/87/EC. At this time, the 63 Table of Contents Company cannot determine fully whether achieving and maintaining compliance with the NAPs to which its subsidiaries are subject will have a material impact on its consolidated operations or results. The risk and benefit associated with achieving compliance with applicable NAPs at several facilities of the Companys subsidiaries are not the responsibility of the Companys subsidiaries, as they are subject to contractual provisions that transfer the costs associated with compliance to contract counterparties. However, one such contract counterparty, GDF Suez, is currently disputing these provisions with AES Energia Cartagena S.R.L. The matter has been submitted to arbitration and the parties are currently awaiting a decision. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Form 10 K for more detail regarding this dispute. In connection with this dispute or any similar dispute that might arise with other contract counterparties, there can be no assurance that the Company and or the relevant subsidiary would prevail, or that the failure to prevail in any such dispute will not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition or consolidated results of operations. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries will bear some or all of the risk and benefit associated with compliance with applicable NAPs at certain facilities. Based upon anticipated operations, CO2 emission allowance allocations, and the costs to acquire offsets and emission allowances for compliance purposes, the Company has not to date incurred material costs to comply with Directive 2003/87/EC and applicable NAPs; however, there can be no guarantees that compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business in future periods. Legislative efforts at the EU have produced a Climate Change Package. This package consists of three directives Carbon Capture & Storage, an amended EU ETS and a revised Renewables Directive. The amended EU ETS and Renewable Directives have now been approved by the EU Parliament and they will enter into force with respect to individual EU member states upon adoption by each such country of implementing legislation or regulations. The main objectives of the Climate Change Package are usually referred to as the 20 20 20 goals: A 20% reduction in EU GHG emissions by 2020, as compared with 1990 levels, or 30% if other developed nations agree to take similar action by 2020; The EU ETS caps on emissions allowances is designed to deliver 21% GHG reduction by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, with distribution of allowances skewed in favor of member states with lower GDP, and with the potential for auctioning to be phased in for affected facilities; 20% increase in energy efficiency; and Minimum compulsory 10% target for renewable energy by 2020. Progress in implementation of the directives referred to above varies from member state to member state, and many states have not yet adopted any implementing legislation or regulations. AES generation businesses in each member state will be required to comply with the relevant measures taken to implement the directives. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the industrialized countries that have ratified it to significantly reduce their GHG emissions, including CO2. The vast majority of developing countries which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol have no GHG reduction requirements, including many of the countries in which the Companys subsidiaries operate. Of the 28 countries in which the Companys subsidiaries currently operate, all but one the United States (including Puerto Rico) have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In December 2010, the annual United Nations conference of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol (called COP 16) was held in Canc&uacute;n, Mexico to focus on establishing an international agreement or framework to succeed the Kyoto Protocol when it expires at the end of 2012. COP 16 did not result in any legally binding successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol, but countries did agree to continue to work toward a successor international agreement on GHG emissions reductions by the next annual conference. Countries also agreed to report their annual GHG emissions and many countries have submitted non binding emission targets. The United States reaffirmed its non binding target of reducing GHG emissions by 17% from 2005 levels by 2020. At present, the Company cannot predict whether compliance with the Kyoto Protocol or any successor agreements will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods. 64 Table of Contents Even though it has been announced that the EU ETS will remain in place even if the Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012 without any successor agreement or commitment on GHG emissions reductions, there remains significant uncertainty with respect to the implementation of NAPs post 2012. The EU has indicated that a portion of the emission allowances given to member states will need to be auctioned under the NAPs and the Company cannot predict with any certainty if compliance with such programs will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa in which subsidiaries of the Company operate may also choose to adopt regulations that directly or indirectly regulate GHG emissions from power plants. For a discussion of regulations in individual countries where our subsidiaries operate, see Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters in this Form 10 K. Although the Company does not currently believe that the laws and regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that have been adopted to date in countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa in which subsidiaries of the Company operate will have a material impact on the Company, the Company cannot predict with any certainty if future laws and regulations in these countries regarding CO2 emissions will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. United States Federal Legislation and Regulation Currently, in the United States there is no Federal legislation establishing mandatory GHG emissions reduction programs (including CO2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. There are numerous state programs regulating GHG emissions from electric power generation facilities and there is a possibility that federal GHG legislation will be enacted within the next several years. Further, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions and has announced its intention to propose new regulations for electric generating units under Section 111 of the United States Clean Air Act (CAA). Potential United States Federal GHG Legislation. Federal legislation passed the United States House of Representatives in 2009 that, if adopted, would impose a nationwide cap and trade program to reduce GHG emissions. In the United States Senate, several different draft bills pertaining to GHG legislation have been considered at various times since then, including comprehensive GHG legislation similar to the legislation that passed the United States House of Representatives and more limited legislation focusing only on the utility and electric generation industry. It is uncertain whether any such legislation or new legislation pertaining to GHG emissions will be voted on or passed by the Senate. If any legislation is passed by the Senate, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be reconciled with the House of Representatives legislation and ultimately enacted into law. However, if any such legislation is enacted, the impact could be material to the Company. EPA GHG Regulation. The EPA promulgated regulations governing GHG emissions from automobiles under the CAA. The effect of the EPAs regulation of GHG emissions from mobile sources is that certain provisions of the CAA will also apply to GHG emissions from existing stationary sources, including many United States power plants. Beginning on January 2, 2011, construction of new stationary sources and modifications to existing stationary sources that result in increased GHG emissions became subject to permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) program of the CAA. The PSD program, as currently applicable to GHG emissions, requires sources that emit above a certain threshold of GHGs to obtain PSD permits prior to commencement of new construction or modifications to existing facilities. In addition, major sources of GHG emissions may be required to amend, or obtain new, Title V air permits under the CAA to reflect any new applicable GHG emissions requirements for new construction or for modifications to existing facilities. The EPA promulgated a final rule on June 3, 2010, (the Tailoring Rule) that sets thresholds for GHG emissions that would trigger PSD permitting requirements. The Tailoring Rule, which became effective in January of 2011, provides that sources already subject to PSD permitting requirements need to install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for greenhouse gases if a proposed modification would result in the 65 Table of Contents increase of more than 75,000 tons per year of GHG emissions. Also, under the Tailoring Rule, commencing in July of 2011, any new sources of GHG emissions that would emit over 100,000 tons per year of GHG emissions, in addition to any modification that would result in GHG emissions exceeding 75,000 tons per year, would require PSD review and be subject to related permitting requirements. The EPA anticipates that it will adjust downward the permitting thresholds of 100,000 tons and 75,000 tons for new sources and modifications, respectively, in future rulemaking actions. The Tailoring Rule substantially reduces the number of sources subject to PSD requirements for GHG emissions and the number of sources required to obtain Title V air permits, although new thermal power plants may still be subject to PSD and Title V requirements because annual GHG emissions from such plants typically far exceed the 100,000 ton threshold noted above. The 75,000 ton threshold for increased GHG emissions from modifications to existing sources may reduce the likelihood that future modifications to plants owned by some of our United States subsidiaries would trigger PSD requirements, although some projects that would expand capacity or electric output are likely to exceed this threshold, and in any such cases the capital expenditures necessary to comply with the PSD requirements could be significant. In December 2010, the EPA entered into a settlement agreement with several states and environmental groups to resolve a petition for review challenging EPAs new source performance standards (NSPS) rulemaking for electric utility steam generating units (EUSGUs) based on the NSPSs failure to address GHG emissions. Under the settlement agreement, the EPA has committed to propose GHG emissions standards for EUSGUs by July 26, 2011 and to finalize GHG emissions standards for EUSGUs by May 26, 2012. The NSPS will establish GHG emission standards for newly constructed and reconstructed EUSGUs. The NSPS also will establish guidelines regarding the best system for achieving further GHG emissions reductions from EUSGUs and, based on such guidelines, individual states will be required to submit a plan to the EPA to establish GHG emission standards for existing EUSGUs within their state. It is impossible to estimate the impact and compliance cost associated with any future NSPS applicable to EUSGUs until such regulations are finalized. However, the compliance costs could have a material and adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. United States State Legislation and Regulation Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The primary regulation of GHG emissions affecting the United States plants of the Companys subsidiaries has been through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Under RGGI, ten Northeastern States have coordinated to establish rules that require reductions in CO2 emissions from power plant operations within those states through a cap and trade program. States participating in RGGI in which our subsidiaries have generating facilities include Connecticut, Maryland, New York and New Jersey. Under RGGI, power plants must acquire one carbon allowance through auction or in the emission trading markets for each ton of CO2 emitted. We have estimated the costs to the Company of compliance with RGGI could be approximately $15 million for 2011. The initial three year compliance period for RGGI expires at the end of 2011 and revisions to RGGI for 2012 and thereafter are currently under discussion. While these estimated compliance costs are not material to the Company, changes in the regulations or price of allowances under RGGI could have a material and adverse impact on our operations and financial performance. The Companys Eastern Energy business is located in New York. Under the New York RGGI rule, each budgeted source of CO2 emissions is required to surrender one CO2 allowance for each metric tonne of CO2 emitted during a three year compliance period. All fossil fuel powered generating facilities in New York that have a generating capacity of 25 or more MW are subject to the rule. Eastern Energy secures its allowance requirements from the RGGI allowance auction or through the secondary market. The Companys Thames business is located in Connecticut. The state of Connecticut passed legislation, effective July 1, 2007, which requires that the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection develop necessary regulations to implement RGGI. The regulations adopted to implement RGGI include an auction of CO2 emission allowances except for several set aside accounts. AES Thames is eligible for a set aside for the first compliance period, 2009 2011, which allows CO2 allowances to be purchased at $2 per allowance in 2009, 66 Table of Contents and $2 per allowance plus a consumer price indexing in years 2010 and 2011. During 2010, a similar $2 per allowance provision for the second compliance period, 2012 2014, was enacted by the Connecticut legislature for contracted facilities. The Companys Warrior Run business is located in Maryland. In April 2006, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Maryland Healthy Air Act which, among other things, required the State of Maryland to join RGGI. The Maryland Department of Environment (MDE) adopted regulations that require 100% of the allowances the State receives to be auctioned except for several small allowance set aside accounts. The MDE regulations include a safety valve to control the economic impact of the CO2 cap and trade program. If the auction closing price reaches $7, up to 50% of a years allowances will be reserved for purchase by electric power generation facilities located within Maryland at $7 per allowance, regardless of auction prices. Warrior Run continues to secure its allowance requirements through the RGGI allowance auction. The Companys Red Oak business is located in New Jersey. The State of New Jersey adopted the Global Warming Response Act in July 2007, which established goals for the reduction of GHG emissions in the State. In furtherance of these goals, in January 2008, additional state legislation authorized the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to develop and adopt RGGI regulations and the NJDEP RGGI regulations became effective in 2008. Under the terms of Red Oaks tolling agreement, RGGI CO2 compliance costs are passed through to its power offtaker. In 2010, of the approximately 40 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in the United States by the businesses operated by our subsidiaries (ownership adjusted), approximately 11.3 million metric tonnes were emitted in states participating in RGGI. Over the past three years, such emissions have averaged approximately 10.9 million metric tonnes. While CO2 emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of CO2 compliance based on a three year average of CO2 emissions for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons, as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes a price of $1.86 per allowance under RGGI. The source of this allowance price estimate was the clearing price in the most recent RGGI allowance auction held in December 2010. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $15 million for 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance. California. The Companys Southland and Placerita businesses are located in California. On September 27, 2006, the Governor of California signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, also called Assembly Bill 32 (A.B. 32). A.B. 32 directs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to promulgate regulations that will require the reduction of CO2 and other GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. On October 29, 2010, CARB released the design of its GHG cap and trade program and on December 16, 2010 voted 9 1 to approve the plan. The plan begins with Phase I in 2012, and initially covers emissions from electricity generating facilities, large industrial sources with annual emissions greater than 25,000 tons, and imported electricity. Emitters will be required to hold enough allowances to match their emissions and can comply by reducing their emissions or by purchasing tradable allowances from other emitters or at state run auctions. Companies that reduce their emissions below the allowances they hold have the opportunity to sell unused allowances. Initially, retail utilities will be issued free allowances and merchant facilities will be required to bid for allowances at auctions. There is a floor price of $10 for all allowances purchased at auctions. The number of free allowances will decline in Phase II and will further decline when Phase III begins in 2018. CARB will continue to refine certain elements of the cap and trade program and further define important provisions, such as allocations in early 2011, through CARBs 15 day notice procedure, whereby changes to adopted regulations are recommended by CARB staff 67 Table of Contents and subject to a 15 day public comment period. The Company believes that any compliance costs arising from A.B. 32 for the thermal power plants of its subsidiaries operating in California will be borne by the power offtaker under the terms of existing tolling agreements with the offtaker and under the terms of A.B. 32. However, after the expiration of such tolling agreements, if the Companys subsidiaries were to sell power on a merchant basis then such compliance costs could be borne by the subsidiaries. Western Climate Initiative (WCI). In February 2007, the governors of the Western United States states (Arizona, New Mexico, California, Washington and Oregon) established the WCI. The WCI has since been joined by two other states (Montana and Utah) and four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec). Participating states and provinces have agreed to cut GHG emissions to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020, and they are considering the implementation of a cap and trade program for the electricity industry to achieve this reduction. On September 23, 2008, the WCI issued its design recommendations for a cap and trade program that would apply to in state electricity generators and the first jurisdictional deliverer of electricity into a WCI partner state. The WCI issued draft guidance on the creation of cap and trade allowance budgets on November 29, 2009. The draft guidance contemplates an eventual cap and trade program with flexible mechanisms, such as allowance banking and offsets. The final regulatory design of this program is not yet known. Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (MGGRA). The Company owns the utility IPL, which is located in Indiana. On November 15, 2007, six Midwestern state governors (including the Governor of Indiana) and the premier of Manitoba signed the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (MGGRA), committing the participating states and province to reduce GHG emissions through the implementation of a cap and trade program. Three states (including Indiana) and the province of Ontario have signed as observers. In May of 2010, the MGGRA Advisory Group finalized a set of recommendations for the establishment of targets for emissions reductions in the region and for the design of a regional cap and trade program. These include a recommended reduction in GHG emissions of 20% below 2005 emission levels by 2025. The recommendations are from the advisory group only, and have not been endorsed or approved by individual governors, including the Governor of Indiana. If Indiana were to implement the recommended reduction targets, the impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be material. Hawaii. The Company owns a power generation facility in Hawaii. On June 30, 2007, the Governor of Hawaii signed Act 234 which sets a goal of reducing GHG emissions to at or below 1990 levels by January 1, 2020. Act 234 also established the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Task Force, which is tasked with developing measures to meet Hawaiis GHG emissions reduction goal. The Task Force filed a report to the Hawaii Legislature on December 30, 2009, strongly supporting the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, which calls for additional renewable energy development, increased energy efficiency, and incorporates already enacted renewable portfolio standards. The Task Force also evaluated other mechanisms and concluded that a state level cap and trade program is inappropriate due to the small size of Hawaiis economy. At this time, other than the estimated impact of CO2 compliance noted above for certain of its businesses that are subject to RGGI, the Company has not estimated the costs of compliance with other potential United States federal, state or regional CO2 emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, such as A.B. 32, WCI, MGGRA and potential Hawaii regulations, due to the fact that most of these proposals are in the early stages of development and any final regulations or laws, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. Although complete specific implementation measures for any federal regulations, A.B. 32, WCI, MGGRA and the Hawaiian regulations have yet to be finalized, if these GHG related initiatives are finalized they may affect a number of the Companys United States subsidiaries unless they are preempted by federal GHG legislation. Any federal, state or regional legislation or regulations adopted in the United States that would require the reduction of GHG emissions could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 68 Table of Contents The possible impact of any future federal GHG legislation or regulations or any regional or state proposal will depend on various factors, including but not limited to: the geographic scope of legislation and or regulation (e.g., federal, regional, state), which entities are subject to the legislation and or regulation (e.g., electricity generators, load serving entities, electricity deliverers, etc.), the enactment date of the legislation and or regulation and the compliance deadlines set forth therein; the level of reductions of CO2 being sought by the regulation and or legislation (e.g., 10%, 20%, 50%, etc.) and the year selected as a baseline for determining the amount or percentage of mandated CO2 reduction (e.g., 10% reduction from 1990 CO2 emission levels, 20% reduction from 2000 CO2 emission levels, etc.); the legislative and or regulatory structure (e.g., a CO2 cap and trade program, a carbon tax, CO2 emission limits, etc.); in any cap and trade program, the mechanism used to determine the price of emission allowances or offsets to be auctioned by designated governmental authorities or representatives; the price of offsets and emission allowances in the secondary market, including any price floors or price caps on the costs of offsets and emission allowances; the operation of and emissions from regulated units; the permissibility of using offsets to meet reduction requirements and the requirements of such offsets (e.g., type of offset projects allowed, the amount of offsets that can be used for compliance purposes, any geographic limitations regarding the origin or location of creditable offset projects), as well as the methods required to determine whether the offsets have resulted in reductions in GHG emissions and that those reductions are permanent (i.e., the verification method); whether the use of proceeds of any auction conducted by responsible governmental authorities is reinvested in developing new energy technologies, is used to offset any cost impact on certain energy consumers or is used to address issues unrelated to power; how the price of electricity is determined at the affected businesses, including whether the price includes any costs resulting from any new CO2 legislation and the potential to transfer compliance costs pursuant to legislation, market or contract, to other parties; any impact on fuel demand and volatility that may affect the market clearing price for power; the effects of any legislation or regulation on the operation of power generation facilities that may in turn affect reliability; the availability and cost of carbon control technology; the extent to which existing contractual arrangements transfer compliance costs to power offtakers or other contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries; whether legislation regulating GHG emissions will preclude EPA from regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act or preempt private nuisance suits or other litigation by third parties; and any opportunities to change the use of fuel at the generation facilities of our subsidiaries or opportunities to increase efficiency. Other United States Air Emissions Regulations and Legislation. In the United States the CAA and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO2, NOX, particulate matter (PM), mercury and other hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The applicable rules and the steps taken by the Company to comply with the rules are discussed in further detail below. 69 Table of Contents The EPA promulgated the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) on March 10, 2005, which required allowance surrender for SO2 and NOX emissions from existing power plants located in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia. CAIR was subsequently challenged in federal court, and on July 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion striking down much of CAIR and remanding it to the EPA. In response to the D.C. Circuits opinion, on July 6, 2010, the EPA issued a new proposed rule (the Clean Air Transport Rule) to replace CAIR. The final Clean Air Transport Rule (Transport Rule) is scheduled to be issued by July 2011. The Transport Rule would require significant additional reductions in SO2 and NOX emissions in 31 states and the District of Columbia starting in 2012, including several states where subsidiaries of the Company conduct business. The Transport Rule contemplates three possible options for reducing SO2 and NOX emissions in the designated states. The EPAs preferred option contemplates a set limit or budget on SO2 and NOX emissions for each of the states, with limited interstate trading of emissions allowances and unlimited intrastate trading of SO2 and NOX emissions allowances. Affected power plants would receive emissions allowances based on the applicable state emissions budgets. The EPAs second option under the Transport Rule would establish emission budgets for each state, but only allow intrastate trading of emissions allowances. The final option would set emission rate limitations for each power plant, but would allow for some intrastate averaging of emission rates. Under any of the proposed options, additional pollution control technology may be required by some of our subsidiaries, and the cost of implementing any such technology could affect the financial condition or results of operations of these subsidiaries or the parent company. The EPA has received public comments on the Transport Rule, and such public comments will be considered by the EPA prior to promulgating a final rule. On December 23, 2009, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) published and enacted a rulemaking requiring the application of Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) for reductions in NOX emissions from electric utility and industrial boilers, combustion turbines and internal combustion engines. The regulations establish that sources subject to the new emission limits must provide a compliance plan by January 1, 2012 and demonstrate compliance by July 1, 2014. As a result of prior EPA determinations and a D.C. Circuit Court ruling, the EPA is obligated under Section 112 of the CAA to develop a rule requiring pollution controls for hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, and nickel species from coal and oil fired power plants. The EPA has entered into a consent decree under which it is obligated to propose the rule by March 2011 and to finalize the rule by November 2011. In connection with such rule, the CAA requires the EPA to establish maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for each pollutant regulated under the rule. MACT is defined as the emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12% of sources in the source category. While it is impossible to project what emission rate levels the EPA may propose as MACT, the rule may require all coal fired power plants to install acid gas scrubbers (wet or dry flue gas desulfurization technology) and or some other type of mercury control technology, such as sorbent injection. Most of the Companys United States coal fired plants have acid gas scrubbers or comparable control technologies, but it is possible that EPA regulations will require improvements to such control technologies at some of our plants. Under the CAA, compliance is required within three years of the effective date of the rule; however, the compliance period for a unit, or group of units, may be extended by state permitting authorities (for one additional year) or through a determination by the President (for up to two additional years). At this time, the Company cannot predict whether new regulations for hazardous air pollutants will be promulgated or, if promulgated, the extent of such regulations, but the cost of compliance with any such regulations could be material. In July 1999, the EPA published the Regional Haze Rule to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas. On June 15, 2005, the EPA proposed amendments to the Regional Haze Rule that, among other things, set guidelines for determining when to require the installation of best available retrofit technology (BART) at older plants. The amendment to the Regional Haze Rule required states to consider the 70 Table of Contents visibility impacts of the haze produced by an individual facility, in addition to other factors, when determining whether that facility must install potentially costly emissions controls. States were required to submit their regional haze state implementation plans (SIPs) to the EPA by December 2007, but only 13 states met this deadline. The EPA has yet to approve any states Regional Haze state implementation plan. The statute requires compliance within five years after the EPA approves the relevant SIP, although individual states may impose more stringent compliance schedules. Other International Air Emissions Regulations and Legislation. In Europe, the Company is, and will continue to be, required to reduce air emissions from our facilities to comply with applicable EC Directives, including Directive 2001/80/EC on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (the LCPD), which sets emission limit values for NOX, SO2, and particulate matter for large scale industrial combustion plants for all member states. Until June 2004, existing coal plants could opt in or opt out of the LCPD emissions standards. Those plants that opted out will be required to cease all operations by 2015 and may not operate for more than 20,000 hours after 2008. Those that opted in, like the Companys Kilroot facility in the United Kingdom, must invest in abatement technology to achieve specific SO2 reductions. Kilroot installed a new flue gas desulphurization system in the second quarter of 2009 in order to satisfy SO2 reduction requirements. The Companys other coal plants in Europe are either exempt from the Directive due to their size or have opted in but will not require any additional abatement technology to comply with the LCPD. In November 2010, the Council of the EU approved a revised directive on industrial emissions so as to reduce emissions of pollutants that are alleged to be harmful to the environment and associated with cancer, asthma and acid rain. The industrial emissions directive seeks to prevent and control air, water and soil pollution by industrial installations. It regulates emissions of a wide range of pollutants, including sulphur and nitrogen compounds, dust particles, asbestos and heavy metals. The directive is aimed at improving local air, water and soil quality. The review integrates seven directives into a single legal framework and provides for a more harmonized and rigorous implementation of emissions limits associated with the cleanest available technology, so called BAT. Deviations from this standard are only permitted where local and technical characteristics would make it disproportionately costly to comply. The recast also tightens emission limits for NOX, SO2 and dust from power plants and large combustion installations in oil refineries and the metal industry. New plants must apply the cleanest available technology from 2012, four years earlier than initially proposed. Existing plants have to comply with this standard beginning in 2016, though a transition period is foreseen. Until June 30, 2020, member states may define transitional plans with declining annual caps for NOX, SO2 or dust emissions. Where installations are already scheduled to close by the end of 2023 or operate less than 17,500 hours after 2016, they may not need to upgrade. Member states have two years to implement the Directive. Progress in implementation of the directives referred to above varies from member state to member state. AES generation businesses in each member state will be required to comply with the relevant measures taken to implement the directives. On January 18 2011, the President of Chile approved a new air emissions regulation submitted to him by the national environmental regulatory agency (CONAMA). The new regulation establishes limits on emissions of NOX, SO2, metals and particulate matter for both existing and new thermal power plants, with more stringent limitations on new facilities. The regulation will become effective upon approval of the General Comptroller of Chile. The regulation will require AES Gener, our Chilean subsidiary, to install emissions reduction equipment at its existing thermal plants from late 2011 through 2015. The exact costs of compliance with such regulation have not yet been determined and the Company believes some of the compliance costs are contractually passed through to counterparties. However, the compliance costs could be material. Water Discharges. The Companys facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water discharges. In particular, the Company is subject to the United States Clean Water Act Section 316(b) rule regarding existing power plant cooling water intake structures issued by the EPA in 2005 (69 Fed. Reg. 41579, July 9, 2004), and the subsequent Circuit Court of Appeals decision and Supreme Court decision regarding this rule. The rule as originally issued could affect 12 of the Companys United States power plants and the rules requirements would 71 Table of Contents be implemented via each plants National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) water quality permit renewal process. These permits are usually processed by state water quality agencies. To protect fish and other aquatic organisms, the 2004 rule requires existing steam electric generating facilities to utilize the best technology available for cooling water intake structures. To comply, a steam electric generating facility must first prepare a Comprehensive Demonstration Study to assess the facilitys effect on the local aquatic environment. Since each facilitys design, location, existing control equipment and results of impact assessments must be taken into consideration, costs will likely vary. The timing of capital expenditures to achieve compliance with this rule will vary from site to site. On January 25, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decision (Docket Nos. 04 6692 to 04 6699) vacated and remanded major parts of the 2004 rule back to the EPA. In November 2007, three industry petitioners sought review of the Second Circuits decision by the United States Supreme Court, and this review was granted by the United States Supreme Court in April 2008. In its April 2009 decision, the United States Supreme Court granted the EPA authority to use a cost benefit analysis when setting technology based requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, and expressed no view on the remaining bases for the Second Circuits remand. New draft rule 316(b) regulations are expected to be proposed by the EPA by March 14, 2011, and finalized by July 27, 2012. Until such regulations are final, the EPA has instructed state regulatory agencies to use their best professional judgment in determining how to evaluate what constitutes best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts from cooling water intake structures. Certain states in which the Company operates power generation facilities, such as New York, have been delegated authority and are moving forward with best technology available determinations in the absence of any final rule from the EPA. On September 27, 2010, the California Office of Administrative Law approved a policy adopted by the California Water Resources Control Board with respect to power plant cooling water intake structures. This policy became effective on October 1, 2010, and establishes technology based standards to implement Section 316(b) of the United States Clean Water Act. At this time, it is contemplated that the Companys Redondo Beach, Huntington Beach and Alamitos power plants in California will need to have in place best technology available by December 31, 2020, or repower the facilities. At present, the Company cannot predict the final requirements under Section 316(b) or whether compliance with the anticipated new 316(b) rule will have a material impact on our operations or results, but the Company expects that capital investments and or modifications resulting from such requirements could be significant. In the third quarter of 2010, we impaired approximately $200 million at our business at Southland as a result of this regulation. Waste Management. In the course of operations, the Companys facilities generate solid and liquid waste materials requiring eventual disposal or processing. With the exception of coal combustion byproducts (CCB), the wastes are not usually physically disposed of on our property, but are shipped off site for final disposal, treatment or recycling. CCB, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air pollution control wastes, is disposed of at some of our coal fired power generation plant sites using engineered, permitted landfills. Waste materials generated at our electric power and distribution facilities include CCB, oil, scrap metal, rubbish, small quantities of industrial hazardous wastes such as spent solvents, tree and land clearing wastes and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated liquids and solids. The Company endeavors to ensure that all of its solid and liquid wastes are disposed of in accordance with applicable national, regional, state and local regulations. On December 22, 2009, a dike at a coal ash containment area at the Tennessee Valley Authoritys plant in Kingston, Tennessee failed, and over 1 billion gallons of ash was released into adjacent waterways and properties. Following such incident, there has been heightened focus on the regulation of CCBs. On June 21, 2010, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule to regulate CCB under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The proposed rule provides two possible options for CCB regulation, and both options contemplate heightened structural integrity requirements for surface impoundments of CCB. The first option contemplates regulation of CCB as a hazardous waste subject to regulation under Subtitle C of the RCRA. Under this option, existing surface impoundments containing CCB would be required to be retrofitted with composite liners and these impoundments would likely be phased out over several years. State and or federal permit programs would be developed for storage, transport and disposal of CCB. States could bring enforcement actions for non compliance with permitting requirements, and the EPA would have oversight responsibilities as well as the authority to bring lawsuits for non compliance. The second option contemplates regulation of CCB under Subtitle D of the RCRA. Under this option, the EPA would create national criteria applicable to CCB landfills and surface impoundments. 72 Table of Contents Existing impoundments would also be required to be retrofitted with composite liners and would likely be phased out over several years. This option would not contain federal or state permitting requirements. The primary enforcement mechanism under regulation pursuant to Subtitle D would be private lawsuits. The public comment period for this proposed regulation has expired, and EPA is required to consider the public comments prior to promulgating a final rule. Requirements under a final rule are expected to become effective by January 2012, with a compliance schedule of five years. While the exact impact and compliance cost associated with future regulations of CCB cannot be established until such regulations are finalized, there can be no assurance that the Companys businesses, financial condition or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such regulations. Subsequent Events Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company continued to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program announced on July 7, 2010. The Company has repurchased 1,026,610 shares at a cost of $13 million in 2011, bringing the cumulative total through February 22, 2010 to 9,409,435 shares at a total cost of $112 million (average price of $11.92 per share including commissions). As of February 25, 2011, $388 million of the $500 million authorized remained available under the stock repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 14 Equity. On February 1, 2011, AES Thames, LLC (Thames), our 208 MW coal fired plant in Connecticut, filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy is due, in part, to the increased cost of energy production. The bankruptcy protection is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or the results of operations. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Form 10 K. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations including those discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10 K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Risks Associated with our Disclosure Controls and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We completed the remediation of our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in 2008. However, our disclosure controls and procedures may not be effective in future periods if our judgments prove incorrect or new material weaknesses are identified. For each of the fiscal quarters since December 31, 2004 through September 30, 2008, our management reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard No. 5), or a combination of deficiencies, that adversely affects a companys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that for each of the fiscal quarters from December 31, 2004 through September 30, 2008, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that financial information that we are required to disclose in our reports under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately. To address these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, each time we prepared our annual and quarterly reports, we performed additional analyses and other post closing procedures. These 73 Table of Contents additional procedures were costly, time consuming and required us to dedicate a significant amount of our resources, including the time and attention of our senior management, toward the correction of these problems. Nevertheless, even with these additional procedures, the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting caused us to have errors in our financial statements and since 2003 we had to restate our annual financial statements six times to correct these errors. The material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting also caused us to delay the filing of certain quarterly and annual reports with the SEC to dates that went beyond the deadlines prescribed by the SECs rules to file such reports. We did not timely file with the SEC our quarterly and annual reports for the year ended December 31, 2005, our quarterly reports for the second and third quarters of 2005, our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2006, and our quarterly report for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Under SEC rules, failure to timely file these reports prohibited us for a period of twelve months from offering and selling our securities pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S 3, which impaired our ability to access the capital markets through the public sale of registered securities in a timely manner. The failure to file our annual and quarterly reports with the SEC in a timely fashion also resulted in covenant defaults under our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing certain of our outstanding debt securities. Such defaults required us to obtain a waiver from the lenders under the senior secured credit facility; however the default under the indentures was cured upon the filing of the reports within the permitted grace period. In addition to these problems, the material weaknesses in internal controls, the restatements of our financial statements and the delay in the filing of our annual and quarterly reports exposed us to other risks including, but not limited to: litigation or an expansion of the SECs informal inquiry into our restatements or the commencement of formal proceedings by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require us to incur significant legal expenses and other costs or to pay damages, fines or other penalties; negative publicity; ratings downgrades; inability to raise capital in the public markets and or private markets when desired or necessary; or the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the Company. Since December 31, 2008, our management has reported that all of our previously identified material weaknesses have been remediated and that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls have been effective. For a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls, see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in this Form 10 K. In making its assessment about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures, management had to make certain judgments and it is possible that any number of their judgments could prove to be incorrect and that our remediation efforts did not fully and completely cure the previously identified material weaknesses. There is also the possibility that there are other material weaknesses in our internal control that are unknown to us or that new material weaknesses may develop in the future. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting would subject us to all of the risks described above. Furthermore, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, changes in accounting practice or policy, or that the degree of compliance with the revised policies or procedures deteriorates over time. Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 74 Table of Contents In the future, we may be adversely impacted by the efforts required to adopt new accounting standards issued by the FASB as a result of the convergence of accounting standards project between the FASB and IASB The U.S Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB), which establishes accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) guidelines that companies follow in the United States, and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which is an international accounting standards setter outside of the United States, are presently engaged in a project to converge several accounting standards. The convergence project may result in the issuance of several new accounting standards in the future that revise existing GAAP accounting standards and which the Company may be required to adopt under GAAP. Based on the present timeline released by the FASB, several pronouncements could be issued in final form in 2011. Although the release of final pronouncements is not assured and the proposed adoption dates of these standards have not been set, each new standard that the Company must comply with may require significant effort to adopt. For each new standard, the Company will be required to evaluate the impact of any accounting changes necessitated by a new standard which will include, but not be limited to, an evaluation of a new standards impact on its financial statements and contractual arrangements; planning for and implementation of any changes to accounting systems; processes and procedures to ensure the Company properly complies with a new standard; and training personnel. To the extent that multiple standards are effective as of one date or in close proximity to one another, the Company may require considerable resources to achieve compliance with these new standards. An inability to complete these efforts prior to their effective date could have an adverse effect on our ability to timely file our financial statements with the SEC and or the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Risks Related to our High Level of Indebtedness We have a significant amount of debt, a large percentage of which is secured, which could adversely affect our business and the ability to fulfill our obligations. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $19.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. All outstanding borrowings under The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility and certain other indebtedness are secured by certain of our assets, including the pledge of capital stock of many of The AES Corporations directly held subsidiaries. Most of the debt of The AES Corporations subsidiaries is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. Since we have such a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in dealing with these secured assets. This high level of indebtedness and related security could have other important consequences to us and our investors, including: making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations at the holding company and or individual subsidiaries; increasing the likelihood of a downgrade of our debt, which could cause future debt costs and or payments to increase under our debt and related hedging instruments and consume an even greater portion of cash flow; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry conditions and economic conditions, including but not limited to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices; reducing the availability of cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and 75 Table of Contents limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock. The agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness. To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Accordingly, our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. See Note 10 Debt included in Item 8. of this Form 10 K for a schedule of our debt maturities. The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise. The AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. All of The AES Corporations revenue is generated through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, almost all of The AES Corporations cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporations ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise. However, our subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to The AES Corporation. Most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or project financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions to The AES Corporation. In addition, the payment of dividends or the making of loans, advances or other payments to The AES Corporation may be subject to other contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may limit the amount of retained earnings that may be distributed to us as a dividend. Subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to The AES Corporation as a result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. Any right that The AES Corporation has to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent right of the holders of The AES Corporations indebtedness to participate in the distribution of, or to realize proceeds from, those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of any such subsidiarys creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary). The AES Corporation could receive less funds than it expects as a result of the current challenges facing the global and local economies, which could impact the performance of our businesses and their ability to distribute cash to The AES Corporation. For further discussion of the macroeconomic environment and its impact on our business, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. The AES Corporations subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of The AES Corporations indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments. While some of The AES Corporations subsidiaries guarantee the Parents indebtedness under the Parents senior secured credit facility, none of its subsidiaries guarantee, or are otherwise obligated with respect to, its outstanding public debt securities. 76 Table of Contents Even though The AES Corporation is a holding company, existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect The AES Corporation. We attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents which, except as noted below, require the loans to be repaid solely from the projects revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. This type of financing is usually referred to as non recourse debt or project financing. In some project financings, The AES Corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which by their terms will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. These obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees, indemnities, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $19.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $4.6 billion was recourse debt of The AES Corporation and approximately $15.1 billion was non recourse debt. In addition, we have outstanding guarantees, letters of credit, and other credit support commitments which are further described in this Form 10 K in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity Parent Company Liquidity. Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010. While the lenders under our non recourse project financings generally do not have direct recourse to The AES Corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by The AES Corporation), defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for The AES Corporation, including, without limitation: reducing The AES Corporations receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to The AES Corporation during the pendency of any default; triggering The AES Corporations obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support which The AES Corporation has provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary; causing The AES Corporation to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; triggering defaults in The AES Corporations outstanding debt and trust preferred securities. For example, The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries; the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the Company; or foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the nonrecourse loans, therefore eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets. None of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that meet the applicable definition of materiality in The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of future mix of distributions, write down of assets, dispositions and other matters that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the applicable definition of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiarys debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility. The risk of such defaults may have increased as a result of the deteriorating global economy. For further 77 Table of Contents discussion of these conditions, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions of this Form 10 K. Risks Associated with our Ability to Raise Needed Capital The AES Corporation has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity. The AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund: principal repayments of debt; interest and preferred dividends; acquisitions; construction and other project commitments; other equity commitments, including business development investments; equity repurchases; taxes; and Parent Company overhead costs. The AES Corporations principal sources of liquidity are: dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level; and proceeds from asset sales. For a more detailed discussion of The AES Corporations cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity of this Form 10 K. While we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the Parent Company level for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. Any number of assumptions could prove to be incorrect and therefore there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. For example, in recent years, certain financial institutions have gone bankrupt. In the event that a bank who is party to our senior secured credit facility or other facilities goes bankrupt or is otherwise unable to fund its commitments, we would need to replace that bank in our syndicate or risk a reduction in the size of the facility, which would reduce our liquidity. In addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding under our credit facilities and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us. Our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to raise capital on favorable terms. From time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: general economic and capital market conditions; the availability of bank credit; 78 Table of Contents investor confidence; the financial condition, performance and prospects of The AES Corporation in general and or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing as well as companies in our industry or similar financial circumstances; and changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital. Should future access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants or expand or improve existing facilities, either of which would affect our future growth, results of operations or financial condition. A downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets which could increase our interest costs or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow. If any of the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs would increase. Furthermore, depending on The AES Corporations credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debt securities, counterparties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, The AES Corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporation. There can be no assurance that such counterparties will accept such guarantees or that AES could arrange such further assurances in the future. In addition, to the extent The AES Corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of credit available to The AES Corporation to meet its other liquidity needs. We may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund greenfield projects in certain less developed economies which could change or in some cases adversely affect our growth strategy. Part of our strategy is to grow our business by developing Generation and Utility businesses in less developed economies where the return on our investment may be greater than projects in more developed economies. Commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non recourse project financing in certain less developed economies, and in these situations we have sought and will continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. As a precondition to making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees of certain project and sovereign related risks. There can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the project or invest more of our own funds which may not be in line with our investment objectives and would leave less funds for other projects. These risks have increased as a result of the recent credit crisis and the deteriorating global economy. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential impact on the Company, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. External Risks Associated with Revenue and Earnings Volatility Our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Some of our businesses sell electricity in the wholesale spot markets in cases where they operate wholly or partially without long term power sales agreements. Our Generation and Utility businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in 79 Table of Contents those markets. The open market wholesale prices for electricity are very volatile and often reflect the fluctuating cost of coal, natural gas or oil. Consequently, any changes in the supply and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity. Volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from among other things: plant availability in the markets generally; availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties; competition; demand for energy commodities; electricity usage; seasonality; interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuation; availability and price of emission credits; input prices; hydrology and other weather conditions; illiquid markets; transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies; availability of competitively priced renewables sources; available supplies of natural gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal; generating unit performance; natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events; energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies; geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas; and general economic conditions in areas where we operate which impact energy consumption. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entitys functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. Dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the United States are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. Dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currencies where our subsidiaries outside the United States report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiarys functional currency. We also experience foreign transaction exposure to the extent monetary assets and liabilities, including debt, are in a different currency than the subsidiarys functional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial position and results of operations have been affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies, primarily the Euro, Brazilian real, Argentine peso, Chilean peso, Colombian peso and Philippine peso. 80 Table of Contents We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. We routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us hedge our interest rate exposure on variable rate debt. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management procedures we have in place may not always be followed or may not work as planned. In particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management system may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with basis risk which is the assumed relative correlation of performance between the intended hedge instrument and the targeted underlying exposure. Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform their obligations under these arrangements. In 2010, we faced substantial challenges in North America as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place but purchase fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. In particular, our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas have been affected by these conditions. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Impairments. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks. We often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could be lower than contracted prices and would expose these businesses to considerable price volatility. At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facilitys output, in some cases under long term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. We have also hedged a portion of our exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price power sales. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. If we were unable to enter into replacement PPAs, these businesses may have to sell power at market prices. 81 Table of Contents The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to The AES Corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. The market pricing of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in future periods. The market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future. Stock price movements on a quarter by quarter basis for the past two years are set forth in Item 5. Market Market Information of this Form 10 K. Factors that could affect the price of our common stock in the future include general conditions in our industry, in the power markets in which we participate and in the world, including environmental and economic developments, over which we have no control, as well as developments specific to us, including, risks that could result in revenue and earnings volatility as well as other risk factors described in this Item 1A. Risk Factors and those matters described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Risks Associated with our Operations We do a significant amount of business outside the United States, including in developing countries, which presents significant risks. A significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the United States and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. Part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in developing countries because the growth rates and the opportunity to implement operating improvements and achieve higher operating margins may be greater than those typically achievable in more developed countries. International operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region; adverse changes in currency exchange rates; government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds; unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies; high inflation and monetary fluctuations; restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate; threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments; difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with GAAP expertise; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties; inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems; adverse changes in government tax policy; 82 Table of Contents difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions. Any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, partly in response to challenging business and political conditions in Kazakhstan, in 2008, we sold certain businesses in that country. As another example, in the second quarter of 2007, we sold our stake in EDC to Petr&oacute;leos de Venezuela, S.A., the state owned energy company in Venezuela after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened to expropriate the electricity business in Venezuela. In connection with the sale, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $680 million. In addition, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenues and gross margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. The operation of power generation and distribution facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results. We and or our subsidiaries may not have adequate insurance coverage for liabilities. We are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including: changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, explosions, terrorist acts or other similar occurrences; and changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to: gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance. Our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations, or interruptions in transportation including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. This could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurring a liability for liquidated damages and or other penalties. As a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation and distribution industries, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to 83 Table of Contents transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or certain external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks. The hazards described above can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A claim for which we are not fully insured or insured at all could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our businesses insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with its operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results or operations, financial condition and prospects. Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our inability to attract and retain skilled people could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. In particular, we routinely are required to assess the financial and tax impacts of complicated business transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. These assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise in GAAP to timely and accurately comply with United States reporting obligations. An inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse affect on our financial and tax reporting. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for load requirements and may result in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. The uncertainty regarding the amount of power that our power generation and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our operating costs. A significant under or over estimation of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much power to cover their obligations, in which case we would be required to buy or sell power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. Those prices may not be favorable and thus could increase our operating costs. 84 Table of Contents We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. Even when we successfully enter into long term contracts, our generation businesses are often dependent on one or a limited number of customers and a limited number of fuel suppliers. Many of our generation plants conduct business under long term contracts. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plants output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts range from 1 to 25 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable. For example, during the past several years, various governmental authorities in Europe have terminated or declined to fulfill their obligations under long term contracts with our subsidiaries. In 2008, as part of the accession to the European Union, the Hungarian government terminated all long term PPAs, including AES Tiszas PPA, as of December 31, 2008. Partly as a result of the termination AES Tiszas results of operations declined and we were required to record an $85 million asset impairment charge for AES Tisza in the third quarter of 2010. Kilroot in Northern Ireland received notice from the Utility Regulator directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the Generating Unit Agreements for the two coal fired units effective November 1, 2010 and, as a result, the performance (and contributions to income and cash flow) from Kilroot will decline in 2011 when compared to prior years. Furthermore, these businesses (and any other businesses whose long term contracts may be challenged) may have to sell electricity into the spot markets. Because of the volatile nature of inputs and power prices, the inability to secure long term contracts could generate increased volatility in our earnings and cash flows and could generate substantial losses (or result in a write down of assets), which could have a material impact on our business and results of operations. We have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customers obligations. However, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment grade credit rating, and our Generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful. These risks have increased as a result of the deteriorating and volatile global economy. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential impact on the Company, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions in this Form 10 K. Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us. The power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain 85 Table of Contents markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas fired power plants have also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on us. Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions. Certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Of the twenty nine defined benefit plans, three are at United States subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. The Company periodically evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. The Companys exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans are more heavily weighted to investments in fixed income securities that have not been as severely impacted by the global recession. Future downturns in the debt and or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. Our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. This may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the Parent Company and our subsidiaries liquidity. For additional information regarding the funding position of the Companys pension plans, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Pension and Postretirement Obligations and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K. Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties. Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing greenfield power plants, some but not all of which have signed long term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to failures of siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. Timing of equipment purchases can also pose financial risks to the Company. As part of our development process, we attempt to make purchases of equipment and or materials as needed. However, from time to time, there may be excess demand for certain types of equipment with substantial delays between the time we place orders and receive delivery. In those instances, to avoid construction delays and costs associated with the inability to own and place such equipment and or materials into service when needed in the construction process, we may place orders well in advance of deployment. In some cases, we may order such equipment and or materials without yet having a specific project where the equipment and or materials will be deployed, in anticipation that equipment and materials will be needed at the time of delivery. However, there is a risk that at the time of delivery, we are required to accept delivery and pay for such equipment and or materials, even though no project has materialized where these items will be used. This can result in our having to incur material equipment and or material costs, with no deployment plan at delivery. Financing risk has also increased as a result of the deterioration of the global economy and the crisis in the financial markets and, as a result, we may forgo certain development opportunities. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are 86 Table of Contents recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, management believes that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this timeframe. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. Historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses may be government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that: we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership; such businesses will perform as expected; integration or other one time costs will not be greater than expected; we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities; such business will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest our capital to acquire them. 87 Table of Contents In some of our joint venture projects and businesses, we have granted protective rights to minority holders or we own less than a majority of the equity in the project or business and do not manage or otherwise control the project or business, which entails certain risks. We have invested in some joint ventures where we own less than a majority of the voting equity in the venture. Very often, one of our subsidiaries seeks to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of projects or businesses in which we have less than a majority of the ownership interests by operating the project or business pursuant to a management contract, negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we do not always have this type of control over the project or business in every instance; and we may be dependent on our co venturers to operate such projects or businesses. Our co venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally. The approval of co venturers also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. In some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders. For example, Companhia Brasiliana de Energia (Brasiliana) is a holding company in which we have a controlling equity interest and through which we own three of our four Brazilian businesses: Eletropaulo, Tiet&ecirc; and Uruguaiana. We entered into a shareholders agreement with an affiliate of the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) which owns more than 49% of the voting equity of Brasiliana. Among other things, the shareholders agreement requires the consent of both parties before taking certain corporate actions, grants both parties rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of interests in Brasiliana and grants certain drag along rights to BNDES. In May 2007, BNDES notified us that it intends to sell all of its interest in Brasiliana pursuant to a public auction (the Brasiliana Sale). BNDES also informed us that if we fail to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of its interest in Brasiliana, then BNDES intends to exercise its drag along rights under the shareholders agreement and cause us to sell all of our interests in Brasiliana in the Brasiliana Sale as well. BNDES has since suspended the auction; however, BNDES may determine to recommence a sale process in the future. In that event, after the auction, if a third party offer has been received in the Brasiliana Sale, we will have 30 days to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of BNDESs interest in Brasiliana on the same terms as the third party offer. If we do not exercise this right and BNDES proceeds to exercise its drag along rights, then we may be forced to sell all of our interest in Brasiliana. Due to the uncertainty in the sale price at this point in time, we are uncertain whether we will exercise our right of first refusal should BNDES receive a valid third party offer in the Brasiliana Sale and, if we do, whether we would do it alone or with joint venture partners. Even if we desire to exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot assure that we will have the cash on hand or that debt or equity financing will be available at acceptable terms in order to purchase BNDESs interest in Brasiliana. If we do not exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot be assured that we will not have to record a loss if the sale price is below the book value of our investment in Brasiliana. Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and regulatory challenges. AES Wind Generation, AES Solar, our greenhouse gas emissions reductions projects (GHG Emissions Reduction Projects), and our investments in projects such as energy storage are subject to substantial risks. Projects of this nature have been developed through advancement in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and which are unrelated to our core business. Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future. For example, several European countries have recently faced a debt crisis, which has or may result in government austerity measures. If these incentives are repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, this could materially impact our renewable businesses, results of operations and financial condition, and impact the ability of the affected 88 Table of Contents businesses to continue or grow their operations. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries, which could also have a material impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, production levels for our wind, solar, and GHG Emissions Reduction Projects may be dependent upon adequate wind, sunlight, or biogas production which can vary significantly from period to period, resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. For example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year. With regard to GHG Emissions Reduction Projects, there is particular uncertainty about whether agreements providing incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, such as the Kyoto Protocol, will continue and whether countries around the world will enact or maintain legislation that provides incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, without which such projects may not be economical or financing for such projects may become unavailable. As a result, renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. In addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in Generation and Utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that many of these projects exist in new or emerging markets, where long term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. These projects can be capital intensive and generally require that we obtain third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects. These risks may be exacerbated by the current global economic crisis, including our managements increased focus on liquidity, which may also result in slower growth in the number of projects we can pursue. The economic downturn could also impact the value of our assets in these countries and our ability to develop these projects. If the value of these assets decline, this could result in a material impairment or a series of impairments which are material in the aggregate, which would adversely affect our financial statements. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or long lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. The fair value of a reporting unit has been determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill outside of the required annual assessment process if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. There could also be impairments if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. See further discussion in Risk Factor, Our Acquisitions May Not Perform as Expected. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. As of December 31, 2010, we had $1.3 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3% of total assets. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to 89 Table of Contents impair goodwill, as further described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Long lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives. Long lived assets are evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of long lived assets, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates, commodity prices and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. Generally, the fair value of a long lived asset or asset group is determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each asset group. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or adverse action or assessment by a regulator. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in additional long lived asset impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to impair long lived assets, as further described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather. Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In the past, our businesses in Latin America have been negatively impacted by lower than normal rainfall. Similarly, our wind businesses are dependent on adequate wind conditions while the solar projects at AES Solar are dependent on sufficient sunlight. In each case, inadequate wind or sunlight could have a material adverse impact on these businesses. Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes. Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our Utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to: changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations; 90 Table of Contents changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utilitys operating income or the rates it charges customers is too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates; changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non controllable costs; adverse changes in tax law; changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium; changes in the timing of tariff increases; other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business. Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business. In many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing or the regulations can be difficult to interpret. As a result, there is risk that we may not properly interpret certain regulations and may not understand the impact of certain regulations on our business. For example, in October 2006, ANEEL, which regulates our utility operations at Sul and Eletropaulo in Brazil, issued Normative Resolution 234 requiring that utilities begin amortizing a liability called Special Obligations beginning with their second tariff reset cycle in 2007 or a later year as an offset to depreciation expense. As of May 23, 2007, the date of the filing of our 2006 Form 10 K, no industry positions or any other consensus had been reached regarding how ANEEL guidance should be applied at that date and accordingly, no adjustments to the financial statements were made relating to Special Obligations in Brazil. Subsequent to May 23, 2007, industry discussions occurred and other Brazilian companies filed Forms 20 F with the SEC reflecting the impact of Resolution 234 in their December 31, 2006 financial statements differently from how the Company accounted for Resolution 234. In the absence of any significant regulatory developments between May 23, 2007 and the date of these other filings, the Company determined that Resolution 234 required us to record an adjustment to our Special Obligations liability as of December 31, 2006. In part, the decision to record the adjustment led to the restatement of our financial statements in the third quarter of 2007. If we face additional challenges interpreting regulations or changes in regulations, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act). While the bulk of regulations contained in the Dodd Frank Act regulate financial institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive compensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to public companies generally. The types of provisions described above are currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Furthermore, while the Dodd Frank Act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, the Dodd Frank Act provides for commercial end user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions, though this is not certain since the Act directs the SEC, CFTC and listed companies to enact rules that will clarify the Dodd Frank Act, and such rulemaking could impact the availability of the commercial end user exemption. Even if the exemption is available, the Dodd Frank Act could still have a material adverse impact on the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non exempt companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these risks. Even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, which could adversely affect the operating results of certain projects; cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated to hedge certain risks, such as project financing agreements; prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; cause the Company to abandon certain of its hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; and or consume substantial liquidity by forcing the Company to post cash and or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 91 Table of Contents On June 12, 2009 AES Kelanitissa received a letter and an invoice from the Director General, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUC) seeking payment of an Annual Regulatory Fee and pursuant to PUC assurances on an application for renewal of the AES Kelanitissa generation license. The application is pursuant to an April 2009 revision of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act (Electricity Act), which came into force in April 2009, notwithstanding that in March 29, 2001, AES Kelanitissa had been granted, and pre paid fees for, a 21 year generation license with effect from September 25, 2000 under the Electricity Act, 1950. AES Kelanitissa submitted an application to be licensed under the revised legislation and, on August 26, 2009, PUC published its intention to issue a generation license under the revised legislation to AES Kelanitissa and other Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in Sri Lanka. This was consistent with assurances received from relevant authorities that the revised legislation was to be amended to grandfather IPPs with existing generation licenses. In a letter dated June 21, 2010 from the PUC, AES Kelanitissa was informed that under the new regulations, as amended in 2009, AES Kelanitissa (Pvt) Ltd no longer fulfilled the eligibility criteria to apply for a generation license. The eligibility criteria to which the letter refers is a provision requiring an element of state ownership. Representatives of AES Kelanitissa have been informed that an amendment to the Electricity Act to grandfather existing IPPs remains in the legislative pipeline, although it is not possible to predict with certainty when or whether such an amendment will be passed. In addition, AES Kelanitissa believes that under Sri Lankan law, it may continue operations under the 21 year license issued in 2001. No step has been taken to date to prohibit AES Kelanitissa from generating power and conducting its operations. However, in the event that it is determined that AES Kelanitissa may not operate under its current license or the revised legislation is not amended (and PUC maintains that AES Kelanitissa is ineligible for a generation license or extension of the Generating License), AES Kelanitissa may not be able to continue operations on grounds that it has no license under the revised legislation. In that event, AES Kelanitissa and or the Company could face a number of adverse consequences, including potential litigation with counterparties mitigating a write down in the value of the assets of the business, continued default status under its debt documents and or other consequences which could have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Our Generation business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the FERC, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations. EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the obligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of the Midwest Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) Interconnection, L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is authorized under the new law to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case by case basis. While the new law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to PURPA, our QFs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long term contracts expire. EPAct 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the United States generation market. 92 Table of Contents In accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets. While the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost of service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate. Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our activities are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air and water emissions. See the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters of this Form 10 K. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies. The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal fired generating plants alleging wide spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with approximately 17 companies over such allegations. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. The principal focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO2 and NOX. In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOX. One of our businesses, IPL, is currently the subject of such an EPA enforcement action, and another business, Eastern Energy, has received an information request from the EPA in connection with a possible enforcement action. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10 K for more detail with respect to these EPA enforcement actions and information requests. There can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations. 93 Table of Contents Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As discussed in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations, at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect or policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2010, the Companys subsidiaries operated businesses which had total approximate CO2 emissions of 77.2 million metric tonnes approximately 40 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 18 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based upon a number of projections and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect such as the forecast dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO2 emissions and our subsidiaries achieving completion of such construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with emissions described below. Because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates. The subsidiaries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there can be no assurance that the subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the Company. Foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial performance. The actual impact on the Companys financial performance and the financial performance of the Companys subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the cost of emissions reduction equipment the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material impact on our results of operations. In January 2005, based on European Community Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading, the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) commenced operation as the largest multi country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the 40 developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO2. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In the United States, there currently is no legislation establishing federal mandatory GHG emission reduction programs (including CO2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. However, federal GHG legislation has been proposed in the United States Congress that would, if enacted, constrain GHG emissions, including CO2, and or impose costs on 94 Table of Contents us that could be material to our business or results of operations. The EPA has also initiated regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new sources of GHG emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing sources planning physical changes that would increase their GHG emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. Such regulations could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse effect on our business and or results of operations. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regulations. At the state level, RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast, became effective in January 2009, and the WCI is also developing market based programs to address GHG emissions in seven western states. In addition, several states, including California, have adopted comprehensive legislation that, when effective, will require mandatory GHG reductions from several industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about the United States state environmental regulations we face. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below), the Company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with United States federal, regional or state CO2 emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that these proposals are in earlier stages of development and any final regulations or legislation, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. The RGGI program became effective in January 2009. The first regional auction of RGGI allowances needed to be acquired by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI was held in September 2008, with subsequent auctions occurring approximately every quarter. Our subsidiaries in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland are subject to RGGI. Of the approximately 40 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2010 (ownership adjusted), approximately 11.3 million metric tonnes were emitted in United States states participating in RGGI. Over the past three years, such emissions have averaged approximately 10.9 million metric tonnes. While CO2 emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of CO2 compliance based on a 3 year average of CO2 emissions for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes a price of $1.86 per allowance under RGGI. The source of this allowance price estimate was the clearing price in the recent RGGI allowance auction held in December 2010. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $15 million for 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance. In addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. For example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. In addition, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. In addition, environmental groups and other private plaintiffs have brought and may decide to bring additional private lawsuits against the Company because of its subsidiaries GHG emissions. The Company is facing and may face in the future private lawsuits relating to GHG emissions that may have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. In one recent case in the United States, which does not involve the Company, a federal appellate court reversed the dismissal by a federal district court of nuisance and other claims against emitters of GHG based on property damage allegedly caused by their contributions to global warming. While the scope of relief sought in that case is 95 Table of Contents unclear, the plaintiffs in this case evidently seek injunctive relief to prevent or reduce further GHG emissions. The defendants appealed the appellate court decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court is expected to render a decision in 2011. If the defendants do not prevail, other parties may be encouraged to bring similar suits against electric power generators, including the Company or any of its United States subsidiaries. Also, unless the United States Congress acts to preempt such suits as part of comprehensive federal legislation, additional lawsuits may be brought against the Company or its subsidiaries. At this stage of the litigation, it is impossible to predict whether such lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the Companys business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Companys subsidiaries. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel fired electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation. In addition to potential physical risks noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of the Company and its subsidiaries due to public perception of GHG emissions by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHG emissions made by subsidiaries of the Company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the Company. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the Companys subsidiaries and on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our subsidiaries have operations in the United States and various non United States jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many non United States jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as non United States, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities. We and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. We and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. 96 Table of Contents The SEC is conducting an informal inquiry relating to our restatements. We have been cooperating with an informal inquiry by the SEC Staff concerning our past restatements and related matters, and have been providing information and documents to the SEC Staff on a voluntary basis. Although we have not received correspondence regarding this inquiry for some time, we have not been advised that the matter is closed. Because we are unable to predict the outcome of this inquiry, the SEC Staff may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported the financial impact of the adjustments to previously filed financial statements and there may be a risk that the inquiry by the SEC could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate previously filed financial statements, amend prior filings or take other actions not currently contemplated. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We maintain offices in many places around the world, generally pursuant to the provisions of long and short term leases, none of which we believe are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are described in Item 1 of this Form 10 K, are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the projects related finance facility. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased. However, in a few instances, no accompanying project financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business, some of which are described below. The Company has accrued for litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has evaluated claims in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies that it deems both probable and reasonably estimable and accordingly, has recorded aggregate reserves for all claims for approximately $450 million and $482 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. These are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within accrued and other liabilities and other long term liabilities. A significant portion of these reserves relate to employment, non income tax and customer disputes in international jurisdictions, principally Brazil. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries, principally in Brazil, are defendants in a number of labor and employment lawsuits. The complaints generally seek unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or other relief. The subsidiaries have denied any liability and intend to vigorously defend themselves in all of these proceedings. There can be no assurance that this reserve will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise. The Company believes, based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. However, even where no reserve has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company, and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material. In 1989, Centrais El&eacute;tricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobr&aacute;s) filed suit in the Fifth District Court in the State of Rio de Janeiro against Eletropaulo Eletricidade de S&atilde;o Paulo S.A. (EEDSP) relating to the methodology for calculating monetary adjustments under the parties financing agreement. In April 1999, the Fifth District Court 97 Table of Contents found for Eletrobr&aacute;s and in September 2001, Eletrobr&aacute;s initiated an execution suit in the Fifth District Court to collect approximately R$1.10 billion ($659 million) from Eletropaulo (as estimated by Eletropaulo) and a lesser amount from an unrelated company, Companhia de Transmiss&atilde;o de Energia El&eacute;trica Paulista (CTEEP) (Eletropaulo and CTEEP were spun off from EEDSP pursuant to its privatization in 1998). In November 2002, the Fifth District Court rejected Eletropaulos defenses in the execution suit. Eletropaulo appealed and in September 2003, the Appellate Court of the State of Rio de Janeiro (AC) ruled that Eletropaulo was not a proper party to the litigation because any alleged liability had been transferred to CTEEP pursuant to the privatization. In June 2006, the Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) reversed the Appellate Courts decision and remanded the case to the Fifth District Court for further proceedings, holding that Eletropaulos liability, if any, should be determined by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulos subsequent appeals to the Special Court (the highest court within the SCJ) and the Supreme Court of Brazil were dismissed. Eletrobr&aacute;s later requested that the amount of Eletropaulos alleged debt be determined by an accounting expert appointed by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulo consented to the appointment of such an expert, subject to a reservation of rights. In February 2010, the Fifth District Court appointed an accounting expert to determine the amount of the alleged debt and the responsibility for its payment in light of the privatization, in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletrobr&aacute;s. Pursuant to its reservation of rights, Eletropaulo filed an interlocutory appeal with the AC asserting that the expert was required to determine the issues in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletropaulo, and that Eletropaulo should be entitled to take discovery and present arguments on the issues to be determined by the expert. In April 2010, the AC issued a decision agreeing with Eletropaulos arguments and directing the Fifth District Court to proceed accordingly. Eletrobr&aacute;s may restart the accounting proceedings at the Fifth District Court at any time, which would proceed according to the ACs April 2010 decision. In the Fifth District Court proceedings, the experts conclusions will be subject to the Fifth District Courts review and approval. If Eletropaulo is determined to be responsible for the debt, after the amount of the alleged debt is determined, Eletrobr&aacute;s will be entitled to resume the execution suit in the Fifth District Court at any time. If Eletrobr&aacute;s does so, Eletropaulo will be required to provide security in the amount of its alleged liability. In that case, if Eletrobr&aacute;s requests the seizure of such security and the Fifth District Court grants such request, Eletropaulos results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and in turn the Companys results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, in February 2008, CTEEP filed a lawsuit in the Fifth District Court against Eletrobr&aacute;s and Eletropaulo seeking a declaration that CTEEP is not liable for any debt under the financing agreement. The parties are disputing the proper venue for the CTEEP lawsuit. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In August 2000, the FERC announced an investigation into the organized California wholesale power markets to determine whether rates were just and reasonable. Further investigations involved alleged market manipulation. FERC requested documents from each of the AES Southland, LLC plants and AES Placerita, Inc. AES Southland and AES Placerita have cooperated fully with the FERC investigations. AES Southland was not subject to refund liability because it did not sell into the organized spot markets due to the nature of its tolling agreement. After hearings at FERC, AES Placerita was found subject to refund liability of $588,000 plus interest for spot sales to the California Power Exchange from October 2, 2000 to June 20, 2001. As FERC investigations and hearings progressed, numerous appeals on related issues were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Over the years, the Ninth Circuit issued several opinions that had the potential to expand the scope of the FERC proceedings and increase refund exposure for AES Placerita and other sellers of electricity. Following remand of one of the Ninth Circuit appeals in March 2009, FERC started a new hearing process involving AES Placerita and other sellers. In May 2009, AES Placerita entered into a settlement, approved by FERC in July 2009, concerning the claims before FERC against AES Placerita relating to the California energy crisis of 2000 2001, including the California refund proceeding. Pursuant to the settlement, AES Placerita paid $6 million and assigned a receivable of $168,119 due to it from the California Power Exchange in return for a release of all claims against it at FERC by the settling parties and other consideration. More than 98% of the buyers in the market elected to join the settlement. A small amount of AES Placeritas settlement payment was placed in escrow for buyers that did not join the settlement (non settling parties). It is unclear whether the escrowed funds will be enough to satisfy any additional sums that might be determined to be owed to 98 Table of Contents non settling parties at the conclusion of the FERC proceedings concerning the California energy crisis. However, any such additional sums are expected to be immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2009, one non settling party, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), filed an appeal of the FERCs approval of the settlement which is pending in the Ninth Circuit. SMUDs appeal has been stayed pending further order of the court. The settlement agreement is still effective and will continue to remain effective unless it is vacated by the Ninth Circuit. SMUD has reached a settlement in principal with buyers of electricity that, if approved by FERC, will leave only immaterial claims of non settling parties against AES Placerita. In August 2001, the Grid Corporation of Orissa, India, now Gridco Ltd. (Gridco), filed a petition against the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (CESCO), an affiliate of the Company, with the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC), alleging that CESCO had defaulted on its obligations as an OERC licensed distribution company, that CESCO management abandoned the management of CESCO, and asking for interim measures of protection, including the appointment of an administrator to manage CESCO. Gridco, a state owned entity, is the sole wholesale energy provider to CESCO. Pursuant to the OERCs August 2001 order, the management of CESCO was replaced with a government administrator who was appointed by the OERC. The OERC later held that the Company and other CESCO shareholders were not necessary or proper parties to the OERC proceeding. In August 2004, the OERC issued a notice to CESCO, the Company and others giving the recipients of the notice until November 2004 to show cause why CESCOs distribution license should not be revoked. In response, CESCO submitted a business plan to the OERC. In February 2005, the OERC issued an order rejecting the proposed business plan. The order also stated that the CESCO distribution license would be revoked if an acceptable business plan for CESCO was not submitted to and approved by the OERC prior to March 31, 2005. In its April 2, 2005 order, the OERC revoked the CESCO distribution license. CESCO has filed an appeal against the April 2, 2005 OERC order and that appeal remains pending in the Indian courts. In addition, Gridco asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Companys indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCOs financial obligations to Gridco. In December 2001, Gridco served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limited (AES ODPL), and Jyoti Structures (Jyoti) pursuant to the terms of the CESCO Shareholders Agreement between Gridco, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and CESCO (the CESCO arbitration). In the arbitration, Gridco appeared to be seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by Gridco. The Company counterclaimed against Gridco for damages. In June 2007, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting Gridcos claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to Gridco. The respondents counterclaims were also rejected. In September 2007, Gridco filed a challenge of the arbitration award with the local Indian court. In June 2008, Gridco filed a separate application with the local Indian court for an order enjoining the Company from selling or otherwise transferring its shares in Orissa Power Generation Corporation Ltd.s (OPGC), an equity method investment, and requiring the Company to provide security in the amount of the contested damages in the CESCO arbitration until Gridcos challenge to the arbitration award is resolved. In June 2010, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal awarded the Company some of its costs relating to the arbitration. In August 2010, Gridco filed a challenge of the cost award with the local Indian court. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In early 2002, Gridco made an application to the OERC requesting that the OERC initiate proceedings regarding the terms of OPGCs existing PPA with Gridco. In response, OPGC filed a petition in the Indian courts to block any such OERC proceedings. In early 2005, the Orissa High Court upheld the OERCs jurisdiction to initiate such proceedings as requested by Gridco. OPGC appealed that High Courts decision to the Supreme Court and sought stays of both the High Courts decision and the underlying OERC proceedings regarding the PPAs terms. In April 2005, the Supreme Court granted OPGCs requests and ordered stays of the High Courts decision and the OERC proceedings with respect to the PPAs terms. The matter is awaiting further hearing. 99 Table of Contents Unless the Supreme Court finds in favor of OPGCs appeal or otherwise prevents the OERCs proceedings regarding the PPAs terms, the OERC will likely lower the tariff payable to OPGC under the PPA, which would have an adverse impact on OPGCs financials. OPGC believes that it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In March 2003, the office of the Federal Public Prosecutor for the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (MPF) notified AES Eletropaulo that it had commenced an inquiry related to the BNDES financings provided to AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and the rationing loan provided to Eletropaulo, changes in the control of Eletropaulo, sales of assets by Eletropaulo and the quality of service provided by Eletropaulo to its customers, and requested various documents from Eletropaulo relating to these matters. In July 2004, the MPF filed a public civil lawsuit in the Federal Court of S&atilde;o Paulo (FSCP) alleging that BNDES violated Law 8429/92 (the Administrative Misconduct Act) and BNDESs internal rules by: (1) approving the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (2) extending the payment terms on the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (3) authorizing the sale of Eletropaulos preferred shares at a stock market auction; (4) accepting Eletropaulos preferred shares to secure the loan provided to Eletropaulo; and (5) allowing the restructurings of Light Servi&ccedil;os de Eletricidade S.A. and Eletropaulo. The MPF also named AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s as defendants in the lawsuit because they allegedly benefited from BNDESs alleged violations. In May 2006, the FCSP ruled that the MPF could pursue its claims based on the first, second, and fourth alleged violations noted above. The MPF subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal with the Federal Court of Appeals (FCA) seeking to require the FCSP to consider all five alleged violations. Also, in July 2006, AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s filed an interlocutory appeal with the FCA, which was subsequently consolidated with the MPFs interlocutory appeal, seeking a transfer of venue and to enjoin the FCSP from considering any of the alleged violations. In June 2009, the FCA granted the injunction sought by AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and transferred the case to the Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro. In May 2010, the MPF filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice challenging the transfer. The MPFs lawsuit before the FCSP has been stayed pending a final decision on the interlocutory appeals. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana (the successor of AES Transg&aacute;s) believe they have meritorious defenses to the allegations asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. AES Florestal, Ltd. (Florestal), had been operating a pole factory and had other assets, including a wooded area known as Horto Renner, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (collectively, Property). Florestal had been under the control of AES Sul (Sul) since October 1997, when Sul was created pursuant to a privatization by the Government of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. After it came under the control of Sul, Florestal performed an environmental audit of the entire operational cycle at the pole factory. The audit discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at the pole factory. The audit concluded that the prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia El&eacute;trica (CEEE), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. Sul and Florestal subsequently took the initiative of communicating with Brazilian authorities, as well as CEEE, about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. The Public Attorneys Office has initiated a civil inquiry (Civil Inquiry n. 24/05) to investigate potential civil liability and has requested that the police station of Triunfo institute a police investigation (IP number 1041/05) to investigate potential criminal liability regarding the contamination at the pole factory. The parties filed defenses in response to the civil inquiry. The Public Attorneys Office then requested an injunction which the judge rejected on September 26, 2008. The Public Attorneys office has a right to appeal the decision. The environmental agency (FEPAM) has also started a procedure (Procedure n. 088200567/059) to analyze the measures that shall be taken to contain and remediate the contamination. Also, in March 2000, Sul filed suit against CEEE in the 2nd Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre seeking to register in Suls name the Property that it acquired through the privatization but that remained registered in CEEEs name. During those proceedings, AES subsequently waived its claim to re register the Property and asserted a claim to recover the amounts paid for the Property. That claim is pending. In November 2005, the 7th Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre ruled that the Property must be returned to CEEE. CEEE has had sole possession of Horto Renner since September 2006 and of the rest of the Property since April 2006. In February 2008, Sul 100 Table of Contents and CEEE signed a Technical Cooperation Protocol pursuant to which they requested a new deadline from FEPAM in order to present a proposal. In March 2008, the State Prosecution office filed a Public Class Action against AES Florestal, AES Sul and CEEE, requiring an injunction for the removal of the alleged sources of contamination and the payment of an indemnity in the amount of R$6 million ($4 million). The injunction was rejected and the case is in the evidentiary stage awaiting the judges determination concerning the production of expert evidence. The above referenced proposal was delivered on April 8, 2008. FEPAM responded by indicating that the parties should undertake the first step of the proposal which would be to retain a contractor. In its response, Sul indicated that such step should be undertaken by CEEE as the relevant environmental events resulted from CEEEs operations. It is estimated that remediation could cost approximately R$14.7 million ($9 million). Discussions between Sul and CEEE are ongoing. In January 2004, the Company received notice of a Formulation of Charges filed against the Company by the Superintendence of Electricity of the Dominican Republic. In the Formulation of Charges, the Superintendence asserts that the existence of three generation companies (Empresa Generadora de Electricidad Itabo, S.A. (Itabo), Dominican Power Partners, and AES Andres BV) and one distribution company (Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S.A. (Este)) in the Dominican Republic, violates certain cross ownership restrictions contained in the General Electricity Law of the Dominican Republic. In February 2004, the Company filed in the First Instance Court of the National District of the Dominican Republic an action seeking injunctive relief based on several constitutional due process violations contained in the Formulation of Charges (Constitutional Injunction). In February 2004, the Court granted the Constitutional Injunction and ordered the immediate cessation of any effects of the Formulation of Charges, and the enactment by the Superintendence of Electricity of a special procedure to prosecute alleged antitrust complaints under the General Electricity Law. In March 2004, the Superintendence of Electricity appealed the Courts decision. In July 2004, the Company divested any interest in Este. The Superintendence of Electricitys appeal is pending. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July 2004, the Corporaci&oacute;n Dominicana de Empresas El&eacute;ctricas Estatales (CDEEE) filed lawsuits against Itabo, an affiliate of the Company, in the First and Fifth Chambers of the Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance for the National District. CDEEE alleges in both lawsuits that Itabo spent more than was necessary to rehabilitate two generation units of an Itabo power plant and, in the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, that those funds were paid to affiliates and subsidiaries of AES Gener and Coastal Itabo, Ltd. (Coastal), a former shareholder of Itabo, without the required approval of Itabos board of administration. In the First Chamber lawsuit, CDEEE seeks an accounting of Itabos transactions relating to the rehabilitation. In November 2004, the First Chamber dismissed the case for lack of legal basis. On appeal, in October 2005 the Court of Appeals of Santo Domingo ruled in Itabos favor, reasoning that it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute because the parties contracts mandated arbitration. The Supreme Court of Justice is considering CDEEEs appeal of the Court of Appeals decision. In the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, which also names Itabos former president as a defendant, CDEEE seeks $15 million in damages and the seizure of Itabos assets. In October 2005, the Fifth Chamber held that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute given the arbitration provisions in the parties contracts. The First Chamber of the Court of Appeal ratified that decision in September 2006. In a related proceeding, in May 2005, Itabo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to compel CDEEE to arbitrate its claims. The petition was denied in July 2005. Itabos appeal of that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has been stayed since September 2006. Further, in September 2006, in an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration, an arbitral tribunal determined that it lacked jurisdiction to decide arbitration claims concerning these disputes. Itabo believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In April 2006, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi (District Court) on behalf of certain individual plaintiffs and all residents and or property owners in the State of Mississippi who allegedly suffered harm as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, whose alleged greenhouse gas emissions contributed to alleged global 101 Table of Contents warming which, in turn, allegedly increased the destructive capacity of Hurricane Katrina. The plaintiffs assert unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy/aiding and abetting, public and private nuisance, trespass, negligence, and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment claims against the defendants. The plaintiffs seek damages relating to loss of property, loss of business, clean up costs, personal injuries and death, but do not quantify their alleged damages. In August 2007, the District Court dismissed the case. The plaintiffs subsequently appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which, in October 2009, affirmed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs unjust enrichment, fraudulent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy claims. However, the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence claims, and remanded those claims to the District Court for further proceedings. In February 2010, the Fifth Circuit granted the petitions for en banc rehearing filed by the Company and other defendants, and thereby vacated its October 2009 decision. In May 2010, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had lost its quorum for en banc review. In August 2010, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the U.S. Supreme Court, requesting the Supreme Court to direct the Fifth Circuit to reinstate the appeal and return it to the panel that issued the October 2009 decision. In January 2011, the Supreme Court denied the petition, ending the case. In July 2007, the Competition Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the Competition Committee) ordered Nurenergoservice, an AES subsidiary, to pay approximately KZT 18 billion ($120 million) for alleged antimonopoly violations in 2005 through the first quarter of 2007. The Competition Committees order was affirmed by the economic court in April 2008 (April 2008 Decision). The economic court also issued an injunction to secure Nurenergoservices alleged liability, freezing Nurenergoservices bank accounts and prohibiting Nurenergoservice from transferring or disposing of its property. Nurenergoservices subsequent appeals to the court of appeals were rejected. In February 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency (the Competition Committees successor) seized approximately KZT 783 million ($5 million) from a frozen Nurenergoservice bank account in partial satisfaction of Nurenergoservices alleged damages liability. However, on appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court, in October 2009, the Supreme Court annulled the decisions of the lower courts because of procedural irregularities and remanded the case to the economic court for reconsideration. On remand, in January 2010, the economic court reaffirmed its April 2008 Decision. Nurenergoservices appeals in the court of appeals (first panel) and the court of appeals (second panel) were unsuccessful. Nurenergoservice intends to file a further appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court. In separate but related proceedings, in August 2007, the Competition Committee ordered Nurenergoservice to pay approximately KZT 1.8 billion ($12 million) in administrative fines for its alleged antimonopoly violations. Nurenergoservices appeal to the administrative court was rejected in February 2009. Given the adverse court decisions against Nurenergoservice, the Antimonopoly Agency may attempt to seize Nurenergoservices remaining assets, which are immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Antimonopoly Agency has not indicated whether it intends to assert claims against Nurenergoservice for alleged antimonopoly violations post first quarter 2007. Nurenergoservice believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it; however, there can be no assurances that it will prevail in these proceedings. In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of the power sales of Ust Kamenogorsk HPP (UK HPP) and Shulbinsk HPP, hydroelectric plants under AES concession (collectively, the Hydros), in January through February 2009. The investigation of Shulbinsk HPP is ongoing, but the investigation of UK HPP has been completed. The Antimonopoly Agency determined that UK HPP abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power in January through February 2009. The Agency sought an order from the administrative court requiring UK HPP to pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 120 million ($1 million) and to disgorge profits for the period at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately KZT 440 million ($3 million). No fines or damages have been paid to date, however, as the proceedings in the administrative court have been suspended due to the initiation of related criminal proceedings against officials of UK HPP. The Hydros believe they have meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. 102 Table of Contents In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of Ust Kamenogorsk TETS LLPs (UKT) power sales in 2008 through February 2009. The Antimonopoly Agency subsequently concluded that UKT abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power and should pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 136 million ($1 million). The Antimonopoly Agency later sought an order from the administrative court requiring UKT to pay the fine. The administrative court proceedings have been suspended due to a related criminal investigation of UKT employees. If the investigation is terminated and the Antimonopoly Agency prevails in the administrative proceedings, UKT may be ordered to pay the administrative fine and disgorge the profits from the sales at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately 514 million KZT ($3 million). UKT believes it has meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In December 2007, an arbitral tribunal terminated ESSAs gas supply contracts with members of the Sierra Chata Consortium in light of the restrictions that had been placed on the export of gas by the Argentine Republic. ESSA thereafter terminated its gas transportation contract with Transportadora de Gas del Norte S.A. (TGN), and initiated arbitration seeking relief from the obligation to pay the firm tariff under ESSAs gas transportation contracts with Gasoducto GasAndes (Argentina) S.A. (GasAndes Argentina) and Gasoducto GasAndes S.A. (GasAndes Chile) or in the alternative, termination of such contracts. TGN (which later filed a lawsuit against ESSA in Argentina), GasAndes Argentina, and GasAndes Chile disputed that the restrictions on the export of gas justified the adjustment or termination of the respective gas transportation contracts and sought due tariff payments. On December 29, 2010, ESSA reached settlement agreements with GasAndes Argentina, GasAndes Chile, and TGN terminating the respective gas transportation contracts and resolving all pending legal disputes and potential future claims. ESSA recognized approximately $72 million as other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2010 related to the settlement agreements. Upon termination of the TGN gas transportation contract, ESSA is no longer required to pay certain charges imposed by the Argentine Republic relating to gas supply infrastructure. In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina, Alaska, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, claiming that the defendants alleged GHG emissions have contributed to alleged global warming which, in turn, allegedly has led to the erosion of the plaintiffs alleged land. The plaintiffs assert nuisance and concert of action claims against the Company and the other defendants, and a conspiracy claim against a subset of the other defendants. The plaintiffs seek to recover relocation costs, indicated in the complaint to be from $95 million to $400 million, and other unspecified damages from the defendants. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the District Court granted in October 2009. The plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The parties have briefed the appeal and are awaiting a date for oral argument. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July, 1993 the Public Attorneys office filed a claim against Eletropaulo, the Sao Paulo State Government, SABESP (a state owned company), CETESB (a state owned company) and DAEE (the municipal Water and Electric Energy Department) alleging that they were liable for pollution of the Billings Reservoir as a result of pumping water from the Pinheiros River into the Billings Reservoir. The events in question occurred while Eletropaulo was a state owned company. An initial lower court decision in 2007 found the parties liable for the payment of approximately R$670 million ($401 million) for remediation. Eletropaulo subsequently appealed the decision to the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo which reversed the lower court decision. In 2009, the Public Attorneys Office has filed appeals to both Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) and the Supreme Court (SC) and such appeals were answered by Eletropaulo in the fourth quarter of 2009. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 1996, a public civil action was asserted against Eletropaulo and Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Desportiva Cultural Eletropaulo (the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o) relating to alleged environmental damage caused by construction of the 103 Table of Contents Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o near Guarapiranga Reservoir. The initial decision that was upheld by the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo in 2006 found that Eletropaulo should repair the alleged environmental damage by demolishing certain construction and reforesting the area, and either sponsor an environmental project which would cost approximately R$1 million ($599 thousand) as of December 31, 2010, or pay an indemnification amount of approximately R$10.2 million ($6 million). Eletropaulo has appealed this decision to the Supreme Court and is awaiting a decision. In February 2009, a CAA Section 114 information request from the EPA regarding Cayuga and Somerset was received. The request seeks various operating and testing data and other information regarding certain types of projects at the Cayuga and Somerset facilities, generally for the time period from January 1, 2000 through the date of the information request. This type of information request has been used in the past to assist the EPA in determining whether a plant is in compliance with applicable standards under the CAA. Cayuga and Somerset responded to the EPAs information request in June 2009, and they are awaiting a response from the EPA regarding their submittal. At this time, it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this request may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position. On February 2, 2009, the Cayuga facility received a Notice of Violation from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) that the facility had exceeded the permitted volume limit of coal ash that can be disposed of in the on site landfill. Cayuga has met with NYSDEC and submitted a Landfill Liner Demonstration Report to them. Such report found that the landfill has adequate engineering integrity to support the additional coal ash and there is no inherent environmental threat. NYSDEC has indicated they accept the finding of the report. A permit modification was approved by the NYSDEC on May 14, 2010 and such permit modification allows for closure of this approximately 10 acre portion of the landfill. The construction in accordance with the approved permit modification was completed in November 2010 and the certification report for this construction project is currently being drafted to submit to the NYSDEC in the second quarter of 2011. While at this time it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this matter may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position, based upon the discussions to date, the Company does not believe the impact will be material. In March 2009, AES Uruguaiana Empreendimentos S.A. (AESU) initiated arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against YPF S.A. (YPF) seeking damages and other relief relating to YPFs breach of the parties gas supply agreement (GSA). Thereafter, in April 2009, YPF initiated arbitration in the ICC against AESU and two unrelated parties, Companhia de Gas do Esado do Rio Grande do Sul and Transportador de Gas del Mercosur S.A. (TGM), claiming that AESU wrongfully terminated the GSA and caused the termination of a transportation agreement (TA) between YPF and TGM (YPF Arbitration). YPF seeks an unspecified amount of damages from AESU, a declaration that YPFs performance was excused under the GSA due to certain alleged force majeure events, or, in the alternative, a declaration that the GSA and the TA should be terminated without a finding of liability against YPF because of the allegedly onerous obligations imposed on YPF by those agreements. In addition, in the YPF Arbitration, TGM asserts that if it is determined that AESU is responsible for the termination of the GSA, AESU is liable for TGMs alleged losses, including losses under the TA. The procedural schedules for the arbitrations have been established but the hearing dates have not been scheduled to date. AESU believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit 104 Table of Contents was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. In June 2009, the Inter American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States (IACHR) requested that the Republic of Panama suspend the construction of AES Changuinola S.A.s hydroelectric project (Project) until the bodies of the Inter American human rights system can issue a final decision on a petition (286/08) claiming that the construction violates the human rights of alleged indigenous communities. In July 2009, Panama responded by informing the IACHR that it would not suspend construction of the Project and requesting that the IACHR revoke its request. In June 2010, the Inter American Court of Human Rights vacated the IACHRs request. With respect to the merits of the underlying petition, the IACHR heard arguments by the communities and Panama in November 2009, but has not issued a decision to date. The Company cannot predict Panamas response to any determination on the merits of the petition by the bodies of the Inter American human rights system. In July 2009, AES Energ&iacute;a Cartagena S.R.L. (AES Cartagena) received notices from the Spanish national energy regulator, Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de Energ&iacute;a (CNE), stating that the proceeds of the sale of electricity from AES Cartagenas plant should be reduced by roughly the value of the CO2 allowances that were granted to AES Cartagena for free for the years 2007, 2008, and the first half of 2009. In particular, the notices stated that CNE intended to invoice AES Cartagena to recover that value, which CNE calculated as approximately 20 million ($27 million) for 2007 2008 and an amount to be determined for the first half of 2009. In September 2009, AES Cartagena received invoices for 523,548 (approximately $694,000) for the allowances granted for free for 2007 and 19,907,248 (approximately $26 million) for 2008. In July 2010, AES Cartagena received an invoice for approximately 5.4 million ($7 million) for the allowances granted for free for the first half of 2009. AES Cartagena does not expect to be charged for CO2 allowances issued free of charge for subsequent periods. AES Cartagena has paid the amounts invoiced and has filed challenges to the CNEs demands in the Spanish judicial system. There can be no assurances that the challenges will be successful. AES Cartagena has demanded indemnification from its fuel supply and electricity toller, GDF Suez, in relation to the CNE invoices under the long term energy agreement (the Energy Agreement) with GDF Suez. However, GDF Suez has disputed that it is responsible for the CNE invoices under the Energy Agreement. Therefore, in September 2009, AES Cartagena initiated arbitration against GDF Suez, seeking to recover the payments made to CNE. In the arbitration, AES Cartagena also seeks a determination that GDF Suez is responsible for procuring and bearing the cost of CO2 allowances that are required to offset the CO2 emissions of AES Cartagenas power plant, which is also in dispute between the parties. To date, AES Cartagena has paid approximately 20 million ($27 million) for the CO2 allowances that have been required to offset 2008 and 2009 CO2 emissions. AES Cartagena expects that allowances will need to be purchased to offset emissions for subsequent years. The evidentiary hearing in the arbitration took place from May 31 June 4, 2010, and closing arguments were heard on September 1, 2010. In February 2011, the arbitral tribunal requested further briefing from the parties on certain issues in the arbitration. If AES Cartagena does not prevail in the arbitration and is required to bear the cost of carbon compliance, its results of operations could be materially adversely affected and, in turn, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company and its results of operations. AES Cartagena believes it has meritorious claims and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 2009, the Public Defenders Office of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (PDO) filed a class action against AES Sul in the 16th District Court of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (District Court), claiming that AES Sul has been illegally passing PIS and COFINS taxes (taxes based on AES Suls income) to consumers. According to ANEELs Order No. 93/05, the federal laws of Brazil, and the Brazilian Constitution, energy companies such as AES Sul are entitled to highlight PIS and COFINS taxes in power bills to final consumers, as the cost of those taxes is included in the energy tariffs that are applicable to final consumers. Before AES Sul had 105 Table of Contents been served with the action, the District Court dismissed the lawsuit in October 2009 on the ground that AES Sul had been properly highlighting PIS and COFINS taxes in consumer bills in accordance with Brazilian law. In April 2010, the PDO appealed to the Appellate Court of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (AC). In November 2010, the AC affirmed the dismissal. The PDO is expected to appeal. If the dismissal is ever reversed and AES Sul does not prevail in the lawsuit and is ordered to cease recovering PIS and COFINS taxes pursuant to its energy tariff, its potential prospective losses could be approximately R$9.6 million ($6 million) per month, as estimated by AES Sul. In addition, if AES Sul is ordered to reimburse consumers, its potential retrospective liability could be approximately R$1.2 billion ($718 million), as estimated by AES Sul. AES Sul believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings if it is served with the action; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in its efforts. Furthermore, if AES Sul does not prevail in the litigation it will seek to adjust its energy tariff to compensate it for its losses, but there can be no assurances that it would be successful in obtaining an adjusted energy tariff. In October 2009, IPL received a Notice of Violation (NOV) and Finding of Violation from EPA pursuant to CAA Section 113(a). The NOV alleges violations of the CAA at IPLs three coal fired electric generating facilities dating back to 1986. The alleged violations primarily pertain to EPAs Prevention of Significant Deterioration and nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) requirements under the CAA. Since receiving the letter, IPL management has met with EPA staff and is currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of similar cases have required companies to pay civil penalties and to install additional pollution control technology on coal fired electric generating units. A similar outcome in this case could have a material impact to IPL and could, in turn, have a material impact on the Company. IPL would seek recovery through customer rates of any operating or capital expenditures related to pollution control technology systems to reduce regulated air emissions; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in that regard. In November 2009, April 2010 and December 2010, substantially similar personal injury lawsuits were filed by a total of 26 residents and estates in the Dominican Republic against the Company, AES Atlantis, Inc., AES Puerto Rico, LP, AES Puerto Rico, Inc., and AES Puerto Rico Services, Inc., in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware. In each lawsuit the plaintiffs allege that the coal combustion byproducts of AES Puerto Ricos power plant were illegally placed in the Dominican Republic in October 2003 through March 2004 and subsequently caused the plaintiffs birth defects, other personal injuries, and or deaths. The plaintiffs do not quantify their alleged damages, but generally allege that they are entitled to compensatory and punitive damages. The AES defendants have moved for partial dismissal of both the November 2009 and April 2010 lawsuits on various grounds. (The AES Defendants have until mid February to respond to the December 2010 lawsuit.) In September 2010, the Superior Court heard arguments on the motions. The Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs fraud allegations without prejudice to replead, and the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in November 2010. The AES defendants have filed a renewed motion to dismiss the amended issues. The remaining claims (other than fraud) addressed in the AES defendants original motion to dismiss are still pending. The AES defendants believe they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. On December 21, 2010, AES 3C Maritza East 1 EOOD, which owns an unfinished 670MW lignite fired power plant in Bulgaria, made the first in a series of demands on the performance bond securing the construction Contractors obligations under the parties EPC Contract. The Contractor failed to complete the plant on schedule. The total amount demanded by Maritza under the performance bond is approximately 155 million ($205 million). However, the Contractor obtained a temporary injunction from a French court preventing the issuing bank from honoring the bond demands. As the performance bond is governed by English law, Maritza obtained a judgment from an English court that the bond should be paid, and then presented this judgment to the French court which issued the temporary injunction. However, on February 10, 2011, the French court issued a decision enjoining the issuing bank from honoring the demands on the performance bond pending the determination of the arbitration between Maritza and the Contractor, described below. Maritza is attempting to 106 Table of Contents lift that injunction or otherwise obtain payment on its demands. In addition, in December 2010, the Contractor issued a notice of dispute alleging that the lignite that has been supplied by Maritza for commissioning of the power plant is out of specification, allegedly entitling the Contractor to an extension of time to complete the power plant, an increase to the contract price of approximately 62 million ($82 million), and other relief. The Contractor thereafter advised Maritza that it had stopped commissioning of the power plants two units because of the characteristics of the lignite supplied, and, in January 2011, initiated arbitration on its lignite claim. Maritza disputes that the lignite is out of specification and intends to defend the arbitration and assert counterclaims for delay liquidated damages and other relief relating to the Contractors failure to complete the power plant and other breaches of the EPC contract. Maritza believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. ITEM 4. REMOVED AND RESERVED 107 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On March 12, 2010, the Company and Terrific Investment Corporation (Investor), a wholly owned subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, entered into a stockholder agreement (the Stockholder Agreement) in connection with the agreement discussed in the following paragraph. Under the Stockholder Agreement, as long as Investor holds more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, Investor will have the right to designate one nominee, who must be reasonably acceptable to the Board, for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. Investor has not designated its nominee for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, until such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock, Investor has agreed to vote its shares in accordance with the recommendation of the Company on any matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company relating to the election of directors and compensation matters. Otherwise, Investor may vote its shares at its discretion. Further, under the Stockholder Agreement, Investor will be subject to a standstill restriction which generally prohibits Investor from purchasing additional securities of the Company beyond the level acquired by it under the stock purchase agreement entered into between Investor and the Company on November 6, 2009. In addition, Investor has agreed to a lock up restriction such that Investor would not sell its shares for a period of 12 months following the closing, subject to certain exceptions. The standstill and lock up restrictions also terminate at such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock. Investor will have certain registration rights and preemptive rights under the Stockholder Agreement with respect to its shares of common stock of the Company. On March 15, 2010, the Company completed the sale of 125,468,788 shares of common stock to Investor. The shares were sold for $12.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.58 billion. Investors ownership in the Companys common stock is now approximately 15% of the Companys total outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers In July 2010, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $500 million of AES common stock. The Board authorization permits the Company to repurchase stock through a variety of methods, including open market repurchases and or privately negotiated transactions. The original authorization was set to expire on December 31, 2010, however; in December 2010, the Board authorized an extension of the stock repurchase program. There can be no assurance as to the amount, timing or prices of repurchases, which may vary based on market conditions and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2010, shares of common stock repurchased under this plan totaled 8,382,825 at a total cost of $99 million plus a nominal amount of commissions (average of $11.86 per share including commissions). There was $401 million remaining under the stock repurchase program available for future repurchases at December 31, 2010. 108 Table of Contents The following table presents information regarding purchases made by The AES Corporation of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2010: Repurchase Period Total Numberof SharesPurchased Average PricePaid per Share Total Number of SharesRepurchased as Partof a Publicly AnnouncedRepurchase Plan Dollar Value of MaximumNumber of Shares To BePurchased Under the Plan 10/1/10 10/31/10 6,086,345 $ 12.30 6,086,345 $ 409,713,649 11/1/10 11/30/10 $ $ 409,713,649 12/1/10 12/31/10 755,000 $ 11.89 755,000 $ 400,732,931 Total 6,841,345 $ 12.26 6,841,345 Market Information Our common stock is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol AES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business We are a global power company. We operate two primary lines of business. The first is our Generation business, where we own and or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities, other intermediaries and certain end users. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our Generation and Utilities businesses comprised approximately 45% and 55% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We are also continuing to expand our wind and solar generation businesses. These initiatives are not material contributors to our operating results at this time, but we believe that certain of these initiatives may become material in the future. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10 K. Our Organization and Segments. Our management reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively EMEA), each managed by a regional president. The financial reporting segment structure uses our management reporting structure as its foundation and reflects how we manage the business internally. Based on our application of the segment reporting accounting guidance, which provides certain quantitative thresholds and aggregation criteria, we have concluded that the Company has the following six reportable segments: Latin America Generation; Latin America Utilities; North America Generation; North America Utilities; Europe Generation; Asia Generation. We report the Companys Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation, Wind Generation and Climate Solutions operating segments within Corporate and Other because they do not meet the criteria to allow for aggregation with another operating segment or the quantitative thresholds that would require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. None of these operating segments are currently material to our financial statement presentation of reportable segments, individually or in the aggregate. Corporate and Other also includes corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments and other intercompany charges such as self insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company modified its internal reporting structure to move the management of the Companys generation business in Jordan, Amman East, from Asia to Europe. Accordingly, Amman East is now reported within the Europe Generation segment. All prior periods have been retrospectively restated to reflect this change and conform to current period presentation. Key Drivers of Our Results of Operations. Our Generation and Utilities businesses are distinguished by the nature of their customers, operational differences, cost structure, regulatory environment and risk exposure. As a result, each line of business has slightly different drivers which affect operating results. Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other things, plant reliability and efficiency, power prices, volume, 113 Table of Contents management of fixed and variable operating costs, management of working capital including collection of receivables, and the extent to which our plants have hedged their exposure to currency and commodities such as fuel. For our Generation businesses which sell power under short term contracts or in the spot market, the most crucial factors are the current market price of electricity and the marginal costs of production. Growth in our Generation business is largely tied to securing new PPAs, expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building or acquiring new power plants. Performance drivers for our Utilities businesses include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; management of working capital, including collection of receivables; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive regulatory requirements; and in developing countries, reduction of commercial and technical losses. The operating results of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth and weather conditions in areas in which they operate. In addition to these drivers, as further explained below, the Company also has exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. One of the key factors which affect our Generation business is our ability to enter into contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of fuel used to produce that electricity. Long term contracts are intended to reduce exposure to volatility associated with fuel prices in the market and the price of electricity by fixing the revenue and costs for these businesses. The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. In turn, most of these businesses enter into long term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. While these long term contractual agreements reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel, the predictability of operating results and cash flows vary by business based on the extent to which a facilitys generation capacity and fuel requirements are contracted and the negotiated terms of these agreements. Entering into these contracts exposes us to counterparty credit risk. For further discussion of these risks, see Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. When fuel costs increase, many of our businesses are able to pass these costs on to their customers. Generation businesses with long term contracts in place do this by including fuel pass through or fuel indexing arrangements in their contracts. Utilities businesses can pass costs on to their customers through increases in current or future tariff rates. Therefore, in a rising fuel cost environment, the increased fuel costs for these businesses often result in an increase in revenue to the extent these costs can be passed through (though not necessarily on a one for one basis). Conversely, in a declining fuel cost environment, the decreased fuel costs can result in a decrease in revenue. Increases or decreases in revenue at these businesses that have the ability to pass through costs to the customer have a corresponding impact on cost of sales, to the extent the costs can be passed through, resulting in a limited impact on gross margin, if any. Although these circumstances may not have a large impact on gross margin, they can significantly affect gross margin as a percentage of revenue. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of revenue is a less relevant measure when evaluating our operating performance. To the extent our businesses are unable to pass through fuel cost increases to their customers, gross margin may be adversely affected. Global diversification also helps us mitigate risk. Our presence in mature markets helps mitigate the exposure associated with our businesses in emerging markets. Additionally, our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, water (hydroelectric power), wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. However, to the extent the mix of fuel sources enabling our generation capabilities in any one market is not diversified, the spread in costs of different fuels or the availability of natural resources such as water for hydroelectric power production or wind may also influence the operating performance and the ability of our subsidiaries to compete within that market. For example, in a market where gas prices fall to a low level compared to coal prices, power prices may be set by low gas prices which can affect the profitability of our coal plants in that market. In certain cases, we may attempt to hedge fuel prices to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, we only hedge a 114 Table of Contents portion of our currency and commodity risks, and our businesses are still subject to these risks, as further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. Commodity and power price volatility could continue to impact our financial metrics to the extent this volatility is not hedged. For a discussion of our sensitivities to commodity, currency and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Form 10 K. Due to our global presence, the Company has significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure is primarily associated with the impact of the translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results from their local currency to U.S. Dollars that is required for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, there is foreign currency transaction exposure when an entity enters into transactions, including debt agreements, in currencies other than their functional currency. These risks are further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. During 2010, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a significant impact on our operating results. If the current foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues, our gross margin and other financial metrics could continue to be affected. Another key driver of our results is our ability to bring new businesses into commercial operation successfully. We currently have approximately 1,300 MW of projects under construction in eight countries. Our prospects for improved operating results and cash flows are dependent upon successful completion of these projects on time and within budget. However, as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties, construction is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with site identification, financing, permitting and our ability to meet construction deadlines. Delays or the inability to complete projects and commence commercial operations can result in increased costs, impairment of assets and other challenges involving partners and counterparties to our construction agreements, PPAs and other agreements. Our gross margin is also impacted by the fact that in each country in which we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity, and environmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business. Regulations differ on a country by country basis (and even at the state and local municipality levels) and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country, and affect many aspects of our operations and development projects. Our ability to negotiate tariffs, enter into long term contracts, pass through costs related to capital expenditures and otherwise navigate these regulations can have an impact on our revenue, costs and gross margin. Environmental and land use regulations, including existing and proposed regulation of GHG emissions, could substantially increase our capital expenditures or other compliance costs, which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. For a further discussion of the Regulatory Environment, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments Environmental, included in Item 8. Financial Statements, Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated with Government Regulation and Laws of this Form 10 K. Key Drivers of Results in 2010 In 2010, the Companys gross margin and cash flow from operations increased $531 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, while net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million compared to the prior year. During 2010, our North American generation businesses continued to face challenges associated with relatively lower gas prices and a decline in power prices relative to coal and other fuel. In particular, lower gas and power prices have affected the generation volume and financial results of our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas which are merchant businesses and not subject to PPAs. We expect 115 Table of Contents this trend to continue. In 2010, these challenges were partially mitigated by hedging arrangements. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Impairments below. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Despite these challenges, many of our financial measures have improved when compared to 2009. Gross margin increased due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation caused by a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies in 2010 and better operating performance at certain businesses. For instance, certain of the Companys Latin American businesses experienced continued increases in market demand due to the local economic recovery in Latin America. The Company also benefited from higher demand and favorable market conditions at Masinloc, our generation business in the Philippines. Masinlocs higher availability enabled the Company to benefit from increased contract and spot market sales and favorable market prices in the Philippines. In addition, cash provided by operating activities increased due to the improved operating results at Latin America generation businesses and Masinloc; contributions from the consolidation of Cartagena and the Ballylumford acquisition in 2010; and changes in working capital in Latin America. Despite the increase in gross margin in 2010, net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased primarily from the impact of long lived asset impairments recognized related to four businesses: Eastern Energy in New York, Southland in California, Tisza II in Hungary and Deepwater in Texas. These were partially offset by gains from the sale of our discontinued businesses in Oman and Qatar and a decrease in goodwill impairment charges. In 2011, we expect to face continued challenges in our business, including the trends in North America described above. In addition, the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and commodity prices on our operations may continue into 2011. In 2011, the components of the tariff reset in Brazil and its potential impact on our Brazilian utilities are uncertain at this time and we expect continued challenges in our merchant businesses such as those in the U.S., Hungary and Northern Ireland. However, management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses and growth from new businesses acquired, that commenced operations in 2010 or are expected to commence operations in 2011, may lessen or offset the impact of these challenges described above, as they did in 2010. However, if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described above or elsewhere in this section impact us more than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our gross margin and net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In addition, we do not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. Such cash flows may be influenced by the operating challenges presented above and will also not include the cash flows from operations which were sold in 2010 or the increases experienced from the cash flows provided by the initial consolidation of Cartagena, the acquisition of Ballylumford and several working capital transactions at our Latin American utilities in 2010 as discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity. The following briefly describes the key changes in our reported revenue, gross margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, Adjusted Earnings per Share (a non GAAP measure) and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Results of Operations and Segment Analysis discussion within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. 116 Table of Contents Performance Highlights Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 Gross Margin $ 3,964 $ 3,433 $ 3,568 Net Income Attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share from Continuing Operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (a non GAAP measure)(1) $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 3,510 $ 2,202 $ 2,160 (1) See reconciliation and definition below under Non GAAP Measure. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue increased $2.7 billion, or 19%, to $16.6 billion in 2010 compared with $14.0 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $805 million; increased volume and rates at our Brazilian utilities attributable to increased demand due to the recovery of the local economy and the favorable impact of the June 2009 tariff reset; the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010; the favorable impact of rates at our generation businesses in Argentina; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; higher demand at Gener in Chile; the impact of the Companys new business in Northern Ireland, acquired in August 2010; and higher demand and rates at Indianapolis Power and Light. Gross margin increased $531 million, or 15%, to $4.0 billion in 2010 compared with $3.4 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $219 million; an increase in demand at our generation and utilities businesses in Latin America; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; and the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs in Latin America, largely driven by bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil in 2009 that did not recur; and lower rates at our generation businesses in New York. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million to $9 million in 2010, compared to $658 million in 2009. Key drivers of the decrease included: Impairment losses in New York related to our Eastern Energy facilities, in California related to our Southland (Huntington Beach) generation facility, in Hungary related to our Tisza II generation facility and in Texas related to our Deepwater facility; 117 Table of Contents A decrease in gain on sale of investments due to the sale of our businesses in Northern Kazakhstan which occurred in 2009; and A decrease in other income due to the reduction in interest and penalties in 2009 associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the Programa de Recuperacao Fiscal (REFIS) program and a favorable court decision in 2009 enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by: The gain on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of Barka which occurred in August 2010; An increase in net equity in earnings of affiliates partially offset by income tax expense related to the sale of the Companys indirect investment in Companhia Energ&eacute;tica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Lower impairment expenses related to a goodwill impairment of our business in Kilroot that occurred in 2009; Lower income tax expense due to 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries; and An increase in gross margin as described above. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion, or 59%, to $3.5 billion in 2010 compared with $2.2 billion in 2009. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $837 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased tax payments in 2009 associated with a tax amnesty program of $326 million, higher working capital requirements during 2009 related to payments on the settlement of swap agreements of $65 million and in 2010, a $50 million decrease in employer contributions to pension plans and lower payments for contingencies; an increase of $215 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to the higher gross margin in 2010 combined with improved working capital mainly as a result of higher collections of value added taxes and accounts receivable; an increase of $99 million at Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher gross margin; and an increase of $58 million as a result of our consolidation of Cartagena in 2010 and the acquisition of Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $136 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations of businesses sold in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of businesses sold was $33 million and will not recur in 2011. In 2010 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities at our Latin American Utilities businesses included several items such as the tax amnesty program and settlement of swap agreements, as described above, that are not expected to recur. In addition, 2010 net cash provided by operating activities benefited from the one time cash savings related to the utilization of tax credits received as a result of the REFIS program. As such, the Company does not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. 118 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue decreased $1.2 billion, or 8%, to $14.0 billion in 2009 compared with $15.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $997 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; decreases in volume at Uruguaiana due to the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold, as well as in New York and Hungary and lower dispatch in Northern Ireland due to unfavorable gas prices compared to coal; the impact of lower spot and contract energy prices at our generation business in Chile; and lower energy prices and volume at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase in tariff rates at our utilities businesses in Latin America primarily reflecting the recovery of energy purchases that were passed through to our customers. Gross margin decreased $135 million, or 4%, to $3.4 billion in 2009 compared with $3.6 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $218 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; lower energy prices and higher purchased energy costs at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic and Argentina; increased pension costs in Brazil and the U.S.; and lower volume in New York due to lower spot market rates. These decreases were partially offset by: improved operating performance at our generation businesses in Chile and the Philippines; higher tariffs in Brazil and El Salvador; and bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $576 million to $658 million in 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: a gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Northern Kazakhstan partially offset by a performance incentive bonus recognized in 2009 for management services provided to these subsidiaries and a settlement upon termination of the management agreement in 2009; the reduction in gross margin in 2009 as described above; and higher impairment expenses in 2009 as a result of an impairment of goodwill at Kilroot in Northern Ireland, and an impairment recognized on our assets in Pakistan which is reflected in discontinued operations, offset by a decline in long lived asset impairment compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by: a reduction in foreign currency transaction losses on net monetary position as a result of reduced losses at our businesses in Chile and the Philippines; a reduction in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates and debt balances in Brazil and favorable foreign currency translation; and lower income tax expenses driven in part by lower pre tax income and a decrease in the effective tax rate from 29% in 2008 to 26% in 2009 due, in part, to tax benefits recorded in 2009 upon the release of 119 Table of Contents valuation allowances at U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recognized in Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. In 2008, the $905 million gain recognized on the sale of our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses had a significant impact on net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In 2009, the Company recognized a performance incentive bonus of $80 million in the first quarter for management services provided to these sold businesses, reflected as other income. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized an additional gain on the sale of the businesses of $98.5 million upon the termination of the management agreement. While the Company engages in the sale of assets and businesses from time to time, the gain or loss recognized in any such sale will depend on a number of factors related to the asset or business that may be sold. Therefore, the Company does not believe that the decline in net income between 2008 and 2009 represents a trend. All of the amounts related to our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses were reported in continuing operations and will not recur in 2010 or future years. Net cash from operating activities increased $42 million, or 2%, to $2.2 billion in 2009 compared with $2.2 billion in 2008. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $238 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to improved working capital management; an increase of $148 million at our Asia Generation businesses due to improved working capital management and improved gross margin; and an increase of $115 million at our Europe Generation businesses primarily due to the collection of the $80 million Kazakhstan management performance incentive bonus in the first quarter 2009. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $391 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased working capital requirements, including the payment of the settlement of a swap agreement, increased tax payments associated with a tax amnesty program and increased payments related to the settlement of contingencies and energy purchases, partially offset by increased operating results; and a decrease of $77 million at our North America Generation businesses, primarily due to reduced operating results. Non GAAP Measure We define adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) mark to market amounts related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) significant gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) significant losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. AES believes that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Companys internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to mark to market gains or losses related to derivative transactions, currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.11 per share. For purposes of measuring loss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be antidilutive. However, for purposes of computing Adjusted 120 Table of Contents EPS (a non GAAP measure), the Company has included the impact of dilutive common stock equivalents as the inclusion of the defined adjustments result in income for Adjusted EPS. The table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in GAAP diluted earnings per share to the weighted average shares used in calculating the non GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Reconciliation of Denominator used for Adjusted Earnings Per Share Loss Shares $ per Share GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Loss from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders $ (86 ) 769 $ (0.11 ) EFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES Stock options 2 Restricted stock units 3 NON GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE $ (86 ) 774 $ (0.11 ) Year Ended December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share 2010 2009 2008 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Derivative mark to market (gains) losses(1) (0.01 ) 0.02 0.05 Currency transaction (gains) losses(2) (0.04 ) (0.04 ) 0.17 Disposition/acquisition (gains) losses (3) (0.19 )(4) (1.27 )(5) Impairment losses 1.07 (6) 0.21 (7) 0.13 (8) Debt retirement (gains) losses 0.03 (9) 0.25 (10) Adjusted earnings per share $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 (1) Derivative mark to market (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

There was no income tax impact associated with any of these transactions. 121 Table of Contents (8) Amount includes: Impairment charges primarily associated with development projects in North America of $75 million ($34 million net of noncontrolling interests and income tax, or $0.06 per share); Uruguaiana asset write down of $36 million ($17 million net of noncontrolling interest, or $0.02 per share); South Africa peaker development cost write off of $31 million ($28 million net of income tax, or $0.04 per share) and a nontaxable impairment of the Companys investment in blue gas (coal to gas) technology of $10 million, or $0.01 per share. Impairment losses are net of an income tax benefit of $0.02 per share in 2008. (9) Amount includes loss on retirement of debt at the Parent Company of $15 million, at Andres of $10 million, and at Itabo of $8 million ($10 million, or $0.01 per share, net of income tax at the Parent Company, $0.01 per share at Andres, and $4 million, or $0.01 per share, net of noncontrolling interest at Itabo). (10) Amount includes: $55 million ($34 million net of income tax, or $0.05 per share) loss on the retirement of Parent Company debt; $131 million, or $0.19 per share, which represented the tax impact on the repatriation of a portion of the Kazakhstan sale proceeds that were used to fund the early retirement of Parent Company debt; and $14 million ($9 million net of income tax, or $0.01 per share) of debt refinancing at IPALCO. Debt retirement (gains) losses are net of an income tax benefit of $0.04 per share in 2008. Managements Priorities Management continues to focus on the following priorities: Execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy including funds received in 2010 from asset and equity sales: investing in value accretive projects; delevering to increase financial flexibility, reduce risk and to create future borrowing capacity; and executing its stock repurchase program; from July through December 2010 we have repurchased a total of $99 million, or approximately 8.4 million shares of AES common stock, at an average price per share of $11.86, including commissions. Improvement of operations in the existing portfolio; Achieve cost savings through the alignment of overhead costs with business requirements, systems automation and optimal allocation of business development spending; Strategic portfolio management of existing projects including restructuring and potential sales of certain North American generation subsidiaries; Completion of an approximately 1,300 MW active construction program on time and within budget; Achieving commercial operation at Maritza in Bulgaria. At the end of 2010, the Company experienced certain commissioning delays, as further described in Key Trends and Uncertainties Development below; and 122 Table of Contents Integration of new projects. During 2010, the following projects were acquired or commenced commercial operations: Project Location Fuel GrossMW AES Equity Interest(Percent, Rounded) Ballylumford United Kingdom Gas 1,246 100 % JHRH(1) China Hydro 379 35 % Nueva Ventanas Chile Coal 272 71 % St. Nikola Bulgaria Wind 156 89 % Guacolda 4(2) Chile Coal 152 35 % Dong Qi(3) China Wind 49 49 % Huanghua II(3) China Wind 49 49 % St. Patrick France Wind 35 100 % North Rhins Scotland Wind 22 100 % Kepezkaya Turkey Hydro 28 51 % Damlapinar(4) Turkey Hydro 16 51 % (1) Jianghe Rural Electrification Development Co.

(3) Joint venture with Guohua Energy Investment Co. Ltd. (4) Joint Venture with I.C. Energy. Key Trends and Uncertainties Our operations continue to face many risks as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Some of these challenges are also described above in Key Drivers of Results in 2010. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. Development. During the past year, the Company has successfully acquired and completed construction of a number of projects, totaling approximately 2,404 MW, including the acquisition of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom and completion of construction of a number of projects in Europe, Chile and China. However, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties of this Form 10 K, our development projects are subject to uncertainties. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not yet begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, we believe that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this time frame. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results or financial position. Global Economic Conditions. During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Although the economic conditions in several of these countries have improved in recent months, our businesses could be impacted in the event these recent trends do not continue. 123 Table of Contents Our business or results of operations could be impacted if our subsidiaries are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all, are unable to raise funds through the sale of assets or are otherwise unable to finance or refinance their activities. The Company could also be adversely affected if capital market disruptions result in increased borrowing costs (including with respect to interest payments on the Companys or our subsidiaries variable rate debt) or if commodity prices affect the profitability of our plants or their ability to continue operations. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if general economic or political conditions in the markets where our subsidiaries operate deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the availability and or an increase in the cost of capital, or if the value of our assets remain depressed or decline further. Any of the foregoing events or a combination thereof could have a material impact on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, financial covenants, and or its credit rating. Our subsidiaries are subject to credit risk, which includes risk related to the ability of counterparties (such as parties to our PPAs, fuel supply agreements, hedging agreements and other contractual arrangements) to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price or to satisfy their financial or other contractual obligations. The Company has not suffered any material effects related to its counterparties during 2010. However, if macroeconomic conditions impact our counterparties, they may be unable to meet their commitments which could result in the loss of favorable contractual positions, which could have a material impact on our business. In addition, during the past year, certain European countries have faced a sovereign debt crisis and it is possible that other nations could be affected. This crisis has resulted in an increased risk of default by governments and the implementation of austerity measures in countries. If the crisis continues, worsens, or spreads, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company. Our businesses may be impacted if they are unable to access the capital markets, face increased taxes or labor costs, or if governments fail to fulfill their obligations to us or adopt austerity measures which adversely impact our projects. In addition, as noted in the Risk Factor entitled, Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges, our renewables businesses are dependent on favorable regulatory incentives, including subsidies, which are provided by sovereign governments. If these subsidies or other incentives are reduced or repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, in whole or in part, this could impact the ability of the affected businesses to continue to grow their operations. For example, the Spanish government recently issued a decree which limits the feed in tariff and number of photovoltaic hours eligible for the tariff, which could adversely impact AES Solar in Spain. For further information on the decree see Item 1. Regulatory Spain of this Form 10 K. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries. For further information on the importance of long term contracts and our counterparty credit risk, see the Risk Factor from this Form 10 K titled, We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. As a result of any of the foregoing events, we may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. The Companys investment in AES Solar, whose primary operations are in Europe, at December 31, 2010 was $312 million. For a discussion of the risks associated with commodity prices, see We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. It is also possible that commodity or power price volatility could continue to impact our financial results. As noted in Key Drivers of Results in 2010, and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk of this Form 10 K, the Companys North American businesses continue to face pressure as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place, but purchase 124 Table of Contents fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. If these conditions continue or worsen, these businesses may need to restructure their obligations or seek additional funding (including from the Parent) or face the possibility that they may be unable to meet their obligations and continue operations. Presently, Eastern Energy, Deepwater and Thames are seeking to restructure their financial obligations and or place certain of their plants in protective layup status to mitigate operating risks caused by high fuel costs and other competitive pressures. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. The Company presently manages its commodity risk with hedging activities to mitigate earnings volatility. However, at present in North America, dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present an opportunity to engage in additional hedging activity for 2011. As a result, there are hedging arrangements in place for only a relatively small portion of 2011. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. Specifically, the operating results of the Companys Eastern Energy generation business in New York could be adversely impacted by continued higher coal prices relative to electricity prices if hedging continues to be uneconomic. If global economic conditions worsen, it could also affect the rates we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our rates based on prevailing market conditions as PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual rate or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. Impairments. Long lived assets. The global economic conditions and other adverse factors discussed above heighten the risk of a significant asset impairment. Examples of conditions that could be indicative of impairment which would require us to evaluate the recovery of a long lived asset or asset group include: current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset group; a significant adverse change in legal factors, including changes in environmental or other regulations or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used or in its physical condition. As further described in Item 1. Regulatory Matters United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR) had the right to require the termination of the long term PPAs under which Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom, supplies electricity to NIE Energy as early as 2010. One of the conditions to the early termination was 180 days notice, which was provided to Kilroot on April 30, 2010. At March 31, 2010, management evaluated Kilroots long lived assets for potential impairment assuming the early termination of the PPA and concluded that no impairment existed at that time. On October 28, 2010, Kilroot received final notice from NIAUR directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the PPA effective November 1, 2010. Kilroot may not be able to replace the contract on competitive terms and, upon cancellation of the PPA effective November 1, 2010, became a merchant plant. It will operate under the gross mandatory pool of the SEM in Northern Ireland. There have been no additional impairment indicators since March 31, 2010. AES Eastern Energy (AEE) operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. 125 Table of Contents The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated an impairment evaluation of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW petroleum coke (pet coke) fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and a recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 126 Table of Contents 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time, since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and what form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations. This was considered as an impairment indicator for the long lived asset groups. The recoverability test of the long lived asset groups indicated that the carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group exceeded its fair value by $200 million which was recognized as an impairment expense. The carrying amounts of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach long lived asset groups were determined to be recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis at September 30, 2010 and no impairment was necessary. During the third quarter of 2010, we also recognized impairment on the long lived assets at our Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. Tisza II operates under an annual contract with an off taker. In the third quarter of 2010, when Tisza II began the negotiation of its 2011 contract, future undiscounted cash flows of the plant were no longer expected to recover the long lived assets groups carrying amount due to prevailing market rates, higher generation costs and lower demand expectations. Accordingly, the Company measured the fair value of the long lived asset group and recorded an impairment expense of $85 million, representing the excess of carrying amount over the fair value at September 30, 2010. Goodwill. The Company seeks business acquisitions as one of its growth strategies. We have achieved significant growth in the past as a result of several business acquisitions, which also resulted in the recognition of goodwill. As noted in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, there is always a risk that Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. The benefits of goodwill are typically realized through the future operating results of an acquired business. Management believes that the recoverability of goodwill is positively correlated with the economic environments in which our acquired businesses operate and a severe economic downturn could negatively impact the recoverability of goodwill. Also, the evolving environmental regulations, including GHG regulations, around the globe continue to increase the operating costs of our generation businesses. In extreme situations, the environmental regulations could even make a once profitable business uneconomical. In addition, most of our generation businesses have a finite life and as the acquired businesses reach the end of their finite lives, the carrying amount of goodwill is gradually recovered through their periodic operating results. The accounting guidance, however, prohibits the systematic amortization of goodwill and rather requires an annual impairment evaluation. Thus, as some of our acquired businesses approach the end of their finite lives, they may incur goodwill impairment charges even if there are no discrete adverse changes in the economic environment. As noted in Long lived assets above, adverse market conditions at Deepwater were also considered an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. Accordingly, in the second and third quarters of 2010, interim 127 Table of Contents goodwill impairment evaluations were performed at the Deepwater reporting unit level. The reporting unit passed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation in the second quarter and no impairment was recognized. In the third quarter, however, the reporting unit failed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation. Upon measurement of impairment loss in Step 2, the entire $18 million goodwill balance was considered impaired and recognized as goodwill impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation and did not have any reporting units that were considered at risk. A reporting unit is considered at risk when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. While there were no potential impairment indicators that could result in the recognition of goodwill impairment for any of these reporting units, it is possible we may incur goodwill impairment on these reporting units in future years if any of the following events occur: a significant adverse change in business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a sale of assets at less than carrying amount, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, an acquisition not performing as expected, changing environmental regulations that significantly increase the cost of doing business, or a business reaches the end of its finite life. The likelihood of the occurrence of these events may increase because of the challenging global macroeconomic conditions. Regulatory Environment. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter and mercury. For a description of material regulations faced by the Company, see Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies and Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows set forth in this Form 10 K. Recent Events Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company continued to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program announced on July 7, 2010. The Company has repurchased 1,026,610 shares at a cost of $13 million in 2011, bringing the cumulative total through February 22, 2010 to 9,409,435 shares at a total cost of $112 million (average price of $11.92 per share including commissions). As of February 25, 2011, $388 million of the $500 million authorized remained available under the stock repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 14 Equity. On February 1, 2011, AES Thames, LLC (Thames), our 208 MW coal fired plant in Connecticut, filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy is due, in part, to the increased cost of energy production. The bankruptcy protection is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or the results of operations. 128 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, Results of operations 2010 2009 2008 $ change2010 vs. 2009 $ change2009 vs. 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: Latin America Generation $ 4,281 $ 3,651 $ 4,468 $ 630 $ (817 ) Latin America Utilities 7,222 6,092 5,907 1,130 185 North America Generation 1,972 1,940 2,234 32 (294 ) North America Utilities 1,145 1,068 1,079 77 (11 ) Europe Generation 1,362 820 1,143 542 (323 ) Asia Generation 618 375 345 243 30 Corporate and Other(1) 1,066 870 1,012 196 (142 ) Eliminations(2) (1,019 ) (862 ) (991 ) (157 ) 129 Total Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 $ 2,693 $ (1,243 ) Gross Margin: Latin America Generation $ 1,497 $ 1,357 $ 1,398 $ 140 $ (41 ) Latin America Utilities 1,072 918 886 154 32 North America Generation 435 477 660 (42 ) (183 ) North America Utilities 249 239 261 10 (22 ) Europe Generation 268 212 273 56 (61 ) Asia Generation 240 93 (10 ) 147 103 Corporate and Other(3) 186 117 62 69 55 Eliminations(4) 17 20 38 (3 ) (18 ) General and administrative expenses (392 ) (339 ) (368 ) (53 ) 29 Interest expense (1,526 ) (1,485 ) (1,770 ) (41 ) 285 Interest income 411 348 519 63 (171 ) Other expense (239 ) (111 ) (161 ) (128 ) 50 Other income 108 465 375 (357 ) 90 Gain on sale of investments 131 909 (131 ) (778 ) Loss on sale of subsidiary stock (31 ) 31 Goodwill impairment (21 ) (122 ) 101 (122 ) Asset impairment expense (1,221 ) (25 ) (175 ) (1,196 ) 150 Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position (33 ) 33 (184 ) (66 ) 217 Other non operating expense (7 ) (12 ) (15 ) 5 3 Income tax expense (307 ) (599 ) (771 ) 292 172 Net equity in earnings of affiliates 183 92 33 91 59 Income from continuing operations 920 1,809 1,929 (889 ) (120 ) Income from operations of discontinued businesses 75 96 97 (21 ) (1 ) Gain (loss) from disposal of discontinued businesses 64 (150 ) 6 214 (156 ) Net income 1,059 1,755 2,032 (696 ) (277 ) Noncontrolling interests: Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,006 ) (1,099 ) (759 ) 93 (340 ) (Income) loss from discontinuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (44 ) 2 (39 ) (46 ) 41 Net income attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 $ (649 ) $ (576 ) Per Share Data: Basic income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.75 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.69 ) Diluted income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.67 ) (1) Corporate and Other includes revenue from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, Wind Generation and other renewables initiatives.

These increases were partially offset by: lower volume sold at Uruguaiana of $53 million as a result of renegotiation of its power sales agreements; lower volume due to unfavorable hydrology in Colombia and Argentina of $41 million; lower contract prices at Gener of $32 million; and lower contract prices on PPAs indexed to international coal prices in the Dominican Republic of $22 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $106 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $34 million, or 3%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher spot prices in Argentina of $69 million; higher volume and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic of $55 million; higher contract prices of $33 million in Colombia; the positive impact of $28 million resulting from the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana, as mentioned above; and higher volume of $23 million in Panama. These increases were partially offset by: higher fuel and purchased energy prices at Gener of $48 million; the net effect of lower PPA prices and higher fuel costs in the Dominican Republic of $38 million; 130 Table of Contents the impact of a reversal of bad debt expense during the first quarter of 2009 of $36 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of one of its power sales agreements; and higher fixed costs of $30 million at Gener primarily due to higher employee costs, increased maintenance expenses and costs incurred due to construction delays at Campiche. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 17% while gross margin increased 10%, primarily due to higher spot purchases and fuel prices at Gener and the reversal of bad debt expense as a result of the renegotiation of one of the power sales agreements at Uruguaiana in the first quarter of 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $181 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $636 million, or 14%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower spot and contract prices of $295 million at Gener; lower volume of $227 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold; and lower energy prices and volume of $174 million in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: and increase of $100 million due to fewer outages at Gener and in Argentina in 2009; and higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $94 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $53 million, or 4%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;; fewer outages of $60 million at Gener and in Argentina; lower diesel consumption, partially offset by higher energy purchases and higher gas consumption, at Gener of $47 million; lower volume of energy purchased at Uruguaiana of $44 million as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements; and the favorable impact of $28 million of a decrease in bad debt expense at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of lower energy prices of $75 million in the Dominican Republic; lower volume and energy prices of $66 million in Argentina; higher purchased energy prices of $48 million at Uruguaiana; and lower spot sales of $48 million at Panama. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 18% while gross margin decreased 3%, primarily due to reduced energy purchases, fewer outages and lower bad debt expense. 131 Table of Contents Latin America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in Latin America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Latin America Utilities Revenue $ 7,222 $ 6,092 $ 5,907 19 % 3 % Gross Margin $ 1,072 $ 918 $ 886 17 % 4 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $697 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2010 increased $433 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $316 million, primarily in Brazil, due to increased market demand; and higher tariffs of $114 million primarily related to the July 2009 tariff reset in Brazil partially offset by the unfavorable impact on rates at Eletropaulo in Brazil of a cumulative adjustment to regulatory liabilities and higher energy prices across our Latin America utility businesses associated with energy purchases passed through to customers of $97 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $107 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $47 million, or 5%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $163 million, primarily in Brazil, due to the increased market demand; and lower contingencies of $142 million in Eletropaulo primarily related to labor contingencies which included a one time reversal, reflecting an agreement with Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o CESP, the pension plan administrator, of $51 million associated with claims for past benefit obligations which will now be accounted for as a component of the pension plan. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $238 million primarily due to the recovery in 2009 of a municipality receivable previously written off in Brazil and higher salaries and other employee related costs, provisions for commercial losses, regulatory penalties and maintenance costs; and $28 million related to the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $442 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2009 increased $627 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $560 million reflecting the recovery of energy purchases of $453 million that were passed through to customers at our utilities in Brazil and El Salvador; and higher volume in Brazil of $62 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $62 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2009 increased $94 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $107 million in El Salvador and Brazil; a $64 million recovery of a municipality receivable previously written off; 132 Table of Contents a non recurring PIS/COFINS fine in 2008 of $33 million; and higher volume of $32 million across the region. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of higher fixed costs of $120 million mainly related to pension expense, labor contingencies and maintenance costs in Brazil. North America Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Generation Revenue $ 1,972 $ 1,940 $ 2,234 2 % 13 % Gross Margin $ 435 $ 477 $ 660 9 % 28 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $19 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $13 million, or 1%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased rates, volume and an availability bonus at TEG/TEP in Mexico of $41 million; higher volume, primarily due to fewer outages and higher rates, of $22 million at Merida in Mexico; higher volume of $19 million at Warrior Run in Maryland due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. These increases were partially offset by: a net decrease of $50 million in New York due to lower rates partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a net decrease of $18 million at Deepwater in Texas primarily due to lower volume; and a net decrease of $14 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3 million, generation gross margin for 2010 decreased $45 million, or 9%, from 2009 primarily due to: a net decrease of $94 million in New York due to lower rates and higher coal prices partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a decrease of $16 million at Deepwater due to lower volume and rates; a net decrease of $11 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage; a decrease of $9 million in Hawaii due to an unfavorable impact of mark to market derivatives; and a decrease of $7 million in Puerto Rico due to higher fixed costs. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase of $39 million in New York primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of lower contract and maintenance costs, and other employee related costs; 133 Table of Contents a net increase of $26 million at TEG/TEP due to a current year availability bonus and fewer outages partially offset by higher fuel prices; higher volume of $14 million at Warrior Run due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 2% while gross margin decreased 9%, primarily due to the change in rates in New York having a greater impact on gross margin than revenue. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $44 million, primarily in Mexico, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $250 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $107 million in New York due to a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a decrease of $80 million due to a reduction in natural gas prices at Merida; increased outages of $22 million, $21 million and $17 million at Warrior Run, TEG/TEP and New York, respectively; lower rates of $20 million at Deepwater; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives in New York of $11 million; and the unfavorable impact in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $9 million, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $174 million, or 26%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $72 million in New York driven by a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a $29 million unfavorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments on coal supply contracts in Hawaii as a result of a gain of $22 million in 2008 compared to a loss of $7 million in 2009; an increase in outages of $22 million and $6 million at Warrior Run and in New York, respectively; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives of $11 million and higher emission allowance purchases of $13 million in New York; and the unfavorable impact of $9 million in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 13% while gross margin decreased 28%, primarily due to the increase in coal prices in New York and the unfavorable impact of derivatives in 2009 in Hawaii that had no corresponding impact on revenue. 134 Table of Contents North America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Utilities Revenue $ 1,145 $ 1,068 $ 1,079 7 % 1 % Gross Margin $ 249 $ 239 $ 261 4 % 8 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Utilities revenue for 2010 increased $77 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail demand of $64 million as a result of warmer weather and higher fuel adjustment charges; and increased wholesale revenue of $11 million primarily due to higher prices. Utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $10 million, or 4%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail margin of $20 million due to increased demand; lower pension expense of $12 million; and lower emission allowance expense of $5 million. These increases were partially offset by: increased maintenance expenses of $16 million due to the timing of major generating unit overhauls; and increased fixed costs of $14 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 7% while gross margin increased 4%, primarily due to increased fuel and maintenance costs. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Utilities revenue for 2009 decreased $11 million, or 1%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower retail volume of $31 million due primarily to milder weather and the economic recession; and decreased wholesale revenue of $7 million driven by lower market prices. These decreases were partially offset by: $32 million of voluntary credits IPL provided to retail customers in 2008. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters North America of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these credits. Utilities gross margin for 2009 decreased $22 million, or 8%, from 2008 primarily due to: decreased wholesale margin of $16 million due to unfavorable prices; and increased pension expense of $25 million largely due to the decline in market value of IPLs pension assets during 2008. 135 Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by: increased retail margin of $15 million, primarily due to the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, partially offset by lower retail sales volumes in 2009; and decreased property tax expense of $5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 1% while gross margin decreased 8%, primarily due to the $25 million increase in pension expense and the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, both of which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. Europe Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Europe for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Europe Generation Revenue $ 1,362 $ 820 $ 1,143 66 % 28 % Gross Margin $ 268 $ 212 $ 273 26 % 22 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $41 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $583 million, or 71%, from 2009 primarily due to: $409 million from the adoption of new accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) which resulted in the consolidation of Cartagena in Spain, a generation business previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting; $117 million from the operations of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom, which was acquired in August 2010; $16 million from a full year of combined cycle operations at our Amman East plant in Jordan, which was single cycle until August 2009; higher tariffs of $16 million at Altai in Kazakhstan; higher volume of $15 million at Kilroot in the United Kingdom largely driven by coal pass through and increased demand, partially offset by lower capacity revenue due to the termination of the long term PPA and related supplementary agreements. These increases were partially offset by: lower volume and sales of emissions allowances in Hungary of $16 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $1 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $57 million, or 27%, from 2009 primarily due to: $62 million from the consolidation of Cartagena as discussed above; higher tariffs and lower fixed costs at Altai of $29 million; and $13 million from the operations of Ballylumford since its acquisition. 136 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: lower gross margin of $28 million primarily from the termination of the long term PPA at Kilroot; and lower gross margin of $20 million in Hungary primarily attributable to higher fuel costs that could not be passed through and lower sales of emission allowances. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 66% while gross margin increased 26%, primarily due to the consolidation of Cartagena and acquisition of Ballylumford that have a larger positive impact on revenue than gross margin, and the positive impact of higher energy revenue at Kilroot, which as a pass through had no corresponding impact on gross margin. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $146 million, driven mainly by Kilroot, Hungary and Kazakhstan, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $177 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower revenue of $101 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower volume of $81 million in Hungary due to the combined impact of the cancellation of one of our PPAs and reduced demand; and lower volume of $67 million at Kilroot, a coal fired plant, mainly driven by lower dispatch due to favorable gas prices compared to coal. These decreases were partially offset by: the benefit of new business of $50 million at Amman East, which commenced single cycle operations in July 2008; and higher rates of $15 million in Kazakhstan. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $35 million, driven mainly by Kilroot and Kazakhstan, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $26 million, or 10%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower gross margin of $41 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower demand of $12 million in Hungary; and an overall increase of $22 million in fixed costs across the region. These decreases were partially offset by: higher capacity revenue at Kilroot; higher energy prices in Kazakhstan; and the benefit of new business at Amman East.

Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $13 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $134 million, or 144%, from 2009 primarily due to a combination of higher availability attributable to improved plant operations, higher market demand and favorable spot prices at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 65% while gross margin increased 158%, primarily due to the positive influence on gross margin due to favorable spot rates and operational efficiencies resulting from the Masinloc plant overhauls in late 2009 and early 2010, which led to higher availability and allowed for more efficient operations that have materially improved the operating results for 2010 as compared to 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $23 million, primarily in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, generation revenue for 2009 increased $53 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: the benefit of $46 million of our new business Masinloc, which was acquired in April 2008; increased revenue of $70 million in 2009 at Masinloc due to improved rates and volume as a result of improved availability and new customer contracts; and $18 million from a one time favorable energy sales settlement at Masinloc. These increases were partially offset by: the decrease in revenue of $71 million at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka primarily due to a decline in fuel costs which are largely passed through to the customer and higher outages in 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by higher capacity revenue. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $6 million, primarily in the Philippines, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $109 million, or 1,090%, from 2008 primarily due to: the impact of our new business at Masinloc of $23 million; a $91 million increase at Masinloc due to higher contract sales, where margins are more favorable than spot sales, lower fuel prices, improved availability and the favorable energy sales settlement described above; and higher capacity revenue at Kelanitissa of $10 million. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $20 million at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue increased 9% while gross margin increased 1,030%, primarily due to higher contract margins at Masinloc as a result of improved operations, availability and lower fuel prices, as well as the larger relative impact on gross margin from the one time favorable energy sales settlement described above. 138 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Corporate and other includes the net operating results from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, AES Wind Generation and renewables projects which are immaterial for the purposes of separate segment disclosure. The following table excludes inter segment activity and summarizes revenue and gross margin for Corporate and Other entities for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Revenue Europe Utilities $ 356 $ 286 $ 403 24 % 29 % Africa Utilities 422 370 379 14 % 2 % Africa Generation 61 65 65 6 % 0 % Wind Generation 202 133 128 52 % 4 % Corp/Other 25 16 37 56 % 57 % Total Corporate and Other $ 1,066 $ 870 $ 1,012 23 % 14 % Gross Margin Europe Utilities $ 21 $ 16 $ 34 31 % 53 % Africa Utilities 65 71 30 8 % 137 % Africa Generation 54 41 28 32 % 46 % Wind Generation 44 11 19 300 % 42 % Corp/Other 2 (22 ) (49 ) 109 % 55 % Total Corporate and Other $ 186 $ 117 $ 62 59 % 89 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $30 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other revenue increased $226 million for 2010, or 26% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: higher volume at our utility businesses in Ukraine driven by an overall increase in market demand; higher volume and utility tariffs at Sonel in Cameroon driven by an increase in market demand; and incremental revenue from new wind generation projects that commenced operations during the year and an overall volume increase across our wind businesses. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $8 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $77 million for 2010, or 66% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: an increase in gross margin from our new wind generation projects and higher volume, as discussed above; and an increase in volume at Dibamba, our generation business, in Cameroon. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs at Sonel. 139 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $162 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other revenue increased $20 million for 2009, or 2%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: higher tariffs in Ukraine of $27 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $12 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $67 million for 2009, or 108%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: a decrease in fixed costs across the Africa region. The increase was partially offset by: higher fuel consumption attributable to lower hydrology at Sonel. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense includes those expenses related to corporate and region staff functions and or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems, and development costs. General and administrative expenses increased $53 million, or 16%, to $392 million in 2010 from 2009. The increase is primarily related to business development costs associated with increased development efforts, primarily in Europe, Turkey and India. General and administrative expenses decreased $29 million, or 8%, to $339 million in 2009 from 2008. The decrease is primarily related to 2008 professional fees associated with remediation efforts and a reduction in business development costs. The favorable variance is partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the worldwide implementation of SAP. Interest expense Interest expense increased $41 million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to interest expense at Cartagena which is now a consolidated entity, higher interest rates at Tiet&ecirc;, increased debt principal at Eletropaulo and interest being expensed related to St. Nikola, our wind project in Bulgaria, due to commencement of operations in 2010. These increases were partially offset by reduced debt principal at the Parent Company. Interest expense decreased $285 million, or 16%, to $1.5 billion in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates globally due to economic conditions and inflationary adjustments to the market price index in Brazil. In addition, interest expense decreased as a result of favorable foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil and lower interest expenses associated with decreased debt balances at Eletropaulo. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense at Masinloc in the Philippines which was acquired in April 2008, and interest expense at Infovias in Brazil where a fee on a non exercised credit line was written off. Interest income Interest income increased $63 million, or 18%, to $411 million in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to a higher average balance in short term investments at Eletropaulo and the favorable impact of 140 Table of Contents foreign currency translation in Brazil as well as the settlement of a dispute related to inflation adjustments for energy sales at Tiet&ecirc;. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest income from a loan to a wind development project in Brazil which was repaid in June 2010. Interest income decreased $171 million, or 33%, to $348 million in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances in Brazil, unfavorable foreign currency translation in Brazil, the impact of decreased interest rates and inflationary adjustments on accounts receivable in 2008 at Gener in Chile and a decreased cash balance at the Parent Company. Other income Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Gain on extinguishment of tax and other liabilities $ 65 $ 168 $ 199 Tax credit settlement 129 Performance incentive fee 80 Insurance proceeds 40 Gain on sale of assets 12 14 34 Other 31 74 102 Total other income $ 108 $ 465 $ 375 Other income of $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to the extinguishment of a swap liability owed by two of our Brazilian subsidiaries, resulting in the recognition of a $62 million gain. The net impact to the Company after taxes and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Other income also included a gain on sale of assets at Eletropaulo. Other income of $465 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $165 million from the reduction in interest and penalties associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the REFIS program and a $129 million gain related to a favorable court decision enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. The net impact to the Company after income taxes and noncontrolling interests for these items was $44 million. In addition, the Company recognized income in 2009 of $80 million from a performance incentive bonus for management services provided to Ekibastuz and Maikuben in 2008. The management agreement was related to the sale of these businesses in Kazakhstan in May 2008; see further discussion of this transaction in Note 22 Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Other income of $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included gains on the extinguishment of a gross receipts tax liability and a legal contingency at Eletropaulo of $117 million and $75 million, respectively, $32 million of cash proceeds related to a favorable legal settlement at Southland in California, $29 million of insurance recoveries for damaged turbines at Uruguaiana, $23 million of gains associated with a sale of land at Eletropaulo and sales of turbines at Itabo, and compensation of $18 million for the impairment associated with the settlement agreement to shut down Hefei. 141 Table of Contents Other expense Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Loss on sale and disposal of assets $ 84 $ 42 $ 34 Gener gas settlement 72 Loss on extinguishment of debt 37 70 AES Wind transaction costs 22 Other 24 69 57 Total other expense $ 239 $ 111 $ 161 Other expense of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $72 million for a settlement agreement of gas transportation contracts at Gener. There were also previously capitalized transaction costs of $22 million that were incurred in connection with the preparation for the sale of a noncontrolling interest in our Wind Generation business which were written off upon the expiration of the letter of intent in June 2010. In addition, there were losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo, Panama, and Gener, an $18 million loss on debt extinguishment at Andres and Itabo and a $15 million loss at the Parent Company from the retirement of senior notes. Other expense of $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $13 million loss recognized when three of our businesses in the Dominican Republic received $110 million par value bonds issued by the Dominican Republic government to settle existing accounts receivable for the same amount from the government owned distribution companies. The loss represented an adjustment to reflect the fair value of the bonds on the date received. Other expense also included losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo and Andres and contingencies at our businesses in Kazakhstan and Alicura in Argentina. Other expense of $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $69 million of losses on the retirement of debt at the Parent Company in connection with the refinancing in June 2008 and IPALCO associated with a $375 million refinancing in April 2008 and losses on disposal of assets primarily at Eletropaulo. Goodwill Impairment In 2010, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2010, Deepwater, our pet coke fired merchant generation facility in Texas, determined that there was an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. This determination was primarily based on managements decision not to operate the plant for more than 30 days in the third quarter of 2010, current operating and cash flow losses, and forecasted operating and cash flow losses for the remainder of 2010 through 2014 as a result of declining trends in energy pricing curves and increasing pet coke prices. As a result, Deepwater recognized a goodwill impairment of $18 million. Deepwater is reported in the North America Generation segment. In 2009, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $122 million. This was a result of impairment at certain of our businesses in the United Kingdom and Ukraine as a result of the Companys annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of October 1. The most significant goodwill impairment was at Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom. Factors contributing to the recognition of impairment included: reduced profit expectations based on latest estimates of future commodity prices and reduced expectations on the recovery of cash flows on the existing plant following the Companys decision to forgo capital expenditures to meet emission allowance requirements taking effect in 2024. The fair value of the Companys reporting units are inherently sensitive to the assumptions underlying the estimates of fair value. Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Fair Value, Goodwill and Intangibles in Item 8 of this Form 10 K provides a 142 Table of Contents more detailed discussion of those assumptions. As discussed in Key Trends and Uncertainties, in the future, the fair values of the Companys reporting units might decline as a result of adverse changes in their operating environments or the businesses reaching the end of their finite lives, which could require the Company to record additional goodwill impairment charges. The Company did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2008. Asset Impairment Expense As discussed in Note 19 Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, asset impairment expense for the year 2010 was $1,221 million and consisted primarily of the following: Eastern Energy AEE operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated a recoverability test of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Southland In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and the exact form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process 143 Table of Contents through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations and the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. The Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment. The asset group was determined to be at the individual plant level and based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined that the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the Huntington Beach asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying value of the Huntington Beach plant of $288 million exceeded the fair value of $88 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $200 million. The undiscounted cash flows of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach generation facilities exceeded their respective carrying values and resulted in no impairment. Huntington Beach is reported in the North America Generation reportable segment. Tisza II During the third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into annual negotiations with the offtaker of its Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. As a result of these preliminary negotiations, as well as the further deterioration of the economic environment in Hungary, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. Thus, the Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and determined that based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount of the Tisza II asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The carrying value of the Tisza II asset group of $160 million exceeded the fair value of $75 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $85 million. Tisza II is reported in the Europe Generation reportable segment. Deepwater In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW pet coke fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, 144 Table of Contents all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Asset impairment expense for the year 2009 was $25 million. In 2009, the Company recognized a pre tax long lived asset impairment charge of $11 million related to the Companys Piabanha hydro project in Brazil. The Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows and abandoned the project. Asset impairment expense for the year 2008 was $175 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, the Company reviewed and prioritized projects in the development pipeline. From this review, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows for certain projects. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $75 million ($34 million, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes) related to two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non power development project at one of our facilities in North America. During 2008, the Company recognized additional impairment charges of $36 million related to long lived assets at Uruguaiana. The impairment was triggered by a combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy in 2007 that continued in 2008. Following an initial impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, further charges were incurred in 2008 due to fixed asset purchase agreements in place. During the first half of 2008, the Company withdrew from projects in South Africa and Israel which resulted in impairment charges of $36 million. The Company also recognized an impairment of $18 million related to the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China. Gain on sale of investments There was no gain on sale of investments in 2010. Gain on sale of investments of $131 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $98 million recognized in May 2009 related to the termination of the management agreement between the Company and Kazakhmys PLC for Ekibastuz and Maikuben, a gain of $14 million from the sale of the remaining assets associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China and $13 million from the reversal of a contingent liability related to the Kazakhstan sale in 2008. Gain on sale of investments of $909 million in 2008 consisted primarily of the sale in May 2008 of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Ekibastuz and Maikuben for a net gain of $905 million. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock There was no loss on sale of subsidiary stock in 2010 or 2009. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock of $31 million in 2008 was the result of sales of AES Gener shares made by our wholly owned subsidiary Cachagua. In November 2008, Cachagua sold 9.6% of its ownership in Gener to a third party reducing its ownership in Gener to 70.6%. 145 Table of Contents Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Companys net monetary position from foreign currency transaction activities: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) AES Corporation $ (50 ) $ 13 $ 38 Chile 8 65 (96 ) Philippines 8 15 (57 ) Brazil (6 ) (9 ) (44 ) Argentina 12 (10 ) (28 ) Kazakhstan 1 (24 ) 14 Colombia (4 ) (11 ) 5 Other (2 ) (6 ) (16 ) Total(1) $ (33 ) $ 33 $ (184 ) (1) Includes (losses) gains of $(10) million, $(39) million and $10 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These losses consisted primarily of losses at The AES Corporation partially offset by gains in Argentina. Losses of $50 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the devaluation of notes receivable resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound, and losses on foreign exchange swaps and options, partially offset by gains on cash balances and debt denominated in British Pounds. Gains of $12 million in Argentina were primarily due to a gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso by 5%, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These gains consisted primarily of gains in Chile, the Philippines and at The AES Corporation partially offset by losses in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. Gains of $65 million in Chile were primarily due to the appreciation of the Chilean Peso of 20% resulting in gains at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Peso, mainly cash and accounts receivables. This gain was partially offset by $14 million in losses on foreign currency derivatives. Gains of $15 million in the Philippines were primarily due to the appreciation of the Philippine Peso of 3%, resulting in gains at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on the remeasurement of U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $13 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the settlement of the senior unsecured credit facility and the revaluation of notes receivable denominated in the Euro, partially offset by losses on debt denominated in British Pounds. Losses of $24 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar and $12 million of foreign currency transaction losses on debt and other liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Kazakh Tenge. 146 Table of Contents Losses of $11 million in Colombia were primarily due to the appreciation of the Colombian Peso of 9%, resulting in losses at Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its Colombian Peso denominated debt and losses on foreign currency derivatives. Losses of $10 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2009, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt, partially offset by derivative gains. Losses of $9 million in Brazil were primarily due to energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar, resulting in foreign currency transaction losses of $18 million, partially offset by gains of $9 million due to the appreciation in 2009 of the Brazilian Real of 25%, resulting in gains at Sul and Uruguaiana associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These losses consisted primarily of losses in Chile, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina partially offset by gains at The AES Corporation and in Kazakhstan. Losses of $96 million in Chile were primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso of 28% in 2008, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable and value added tax (VAT) receivables. Losses of $57 million in the Philippines were primarily due to remeasurement losses at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on U.S. Dollar denominated debt resulting from depreciation of the Philippine Peso of 14% in 2008. Losses of $44 million in Brazil were primarily due to the realization of deferred exchange variance on past energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar. Losses of $28 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2008, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $38 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to debt denominated in British Pounds and gains on foreign exchange derivatives, partially offset by losses on notes receivable denominated in the Euro. Gains of $14 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction gains of $16 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar, offset by $5 million of foreign currency transaction losses on external and intercompany debt denominated in other than the Kazakh Tenge functional currency. Income taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $292 million, or 49%, to $307 million in 2010. The Companys effective tax rates were 29% for 2010 and 26% for 2009. The net increase in the 2010 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 relating to the CEMIG sale transaction, tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowances at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, and $165 million of non taxable income recorded in 2009 at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program. These items were offset by income tax benefits related to a reversal of withholding tax liabilities at certain Chilean subsidiaries and 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries. Included in the net tax expense related to the CEMIG sale transaction is tax expense on the equity earnings associated with the reversal of the net long term liability and tax benefit related to release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. 147 Table of Contents Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $172 million, or 22%, to $599 million in 2009. The Companys effective tax rates were 26% for 2009 and 29% for 2008. The net decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowance at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recorded at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $91 million, or 99%, to $183 million in 2010 from $92 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a gain recognized upon the sale of our interest in CEMIG during the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by 2009 equity in earnings of Cartagena which was accounted for as a consolidated entity in 2010 and thus reported directly within revenues and expenses. Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $59 million, or 179%, to $92 million in 2009 from $33 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a cash settlement received by Cartagena, in Spain, in June 2009 for liquidated damages received related to a construction delay from December 2005 to November 2006; increased earnings at Guacolda in Chile mainly due to lower cost of coal; increased earnings of Chigen affiliates from higher tariffs partially offset by lower volume and a valuation write off in 2008 at an affiliate in Turkey. These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings at OPGC, in India, mainly due to lower tariff and a dividend distribution tax in March 2009 and increased expenses for an equipment overhaul at Elsta in the Netherlands. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $93 million, or 8%, to $1.0 billion in 2010 from $1.1 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreased earnings at Eletropaulo as a result of the absence of legal settlement income present in 2009, a loss on legal settlement at Gener and reduced revenues due to decreased coal prices along with higher electricity purchases at Itabo. These decreases were partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian Real. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $340 million, or 45%, to $1.1 billion in 2009 from $0.8 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to increases in gross margin and other income, lower interest expense and a decrease in impairments in 2009 at our Brazilian businesses, and increases in gross margin and foreign currency transaction gains at our businesses in Chile. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $44 million at certain of our wind generation businesses as a result of a charge related to the potential future taxes that could be deemed due in the calculation of the hypothetical liquidation value of certain of our wind tax equity partnerships. Discontinued operations As further discussed in Note 21 Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Businesses to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, Discontinued Operations includes the results of five businesses: Ras Laffan, a generation business in Qatar (sold in October 2010); Barka, a generation business in Oman, (sold in August 2010); Lal Pir and Pak Gen, generation businesses in Pakistan, (sold in June 2010); and Jiaozuo, a generation business in China, (sold in December 2008). Prior periods have been restated to reflect these businesses within Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. In 2010, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $39 million and reflected the operations of our 55% stake in Ras Laffan, a combined cycle gas facility and water desalination plant in Qatar, our 35% stake in Barka, a combined cycle gas 148 Table of Contents facility and water desalination plant in Oman and our 55% stake in Lal Pir and Pak Gen, two oil fired facilities in Pakistan. The sale of Lal Pir and Pak Gen closed in June 2010, resulting in additional impairment expense and a loss on the sale in 2010 of $14 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The Barka plant was sold in August 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $63 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The sale of Ras Laffan closed in October 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $6 million, net of tax. In 2009, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $54 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir and Pak Gen. Loss on disposal of discontinued businesses, net of tax and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $105 million and represented the difference between the net book value of the Companys interests in its Pakistan businesses and their estimated fair value. In 2008, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $60 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir, Pak Gen and Jiaozuo, a coal fired generation facility in China sold in December 2008. The Company received $73 million for its 70% interest in the business. The net gain on the disposition was $7 million. Critical Accounting Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Companys most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Reserves We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the tax jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material. 149 Table of Contents On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act). The Act includes several provisions which provide for tax relief for businesses by extending certain tax benefits and credits, including the Subpart F exception for active financing income and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look through provisions of Subpart F. This legislation resulted in a benefit for the Companys 2010 provision for income taxes; however, there can be no assurances that the benefits of this legislation will extend beyond 2011, when it is currently scheduled to expire. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Goodwill and Other Intangibles and Long lived Assets, respectively, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level on October 1. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying amount. A long lived asset (asset group) will be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e., the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are less than its carrying amount. In the event that the carrying amount of the long lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment evaluation is performed, in which the fair value of the asset is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. Examples of indicators that would result in an impairment test for goodwill and a recoverability test for long lived assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate, legislation changes or a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition. Throughout the impairment evaluation process, management makes considerable judgments; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part of an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost/benefit analysis and the Companys internal valuation knowledge of the long lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the DCF model), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factors expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. 150 Table of Contents A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Managements Discussion and Analysis, Consolidated Results of Operations Goodwill Impairment and Asset Impairment Expense and Note 19 Impairment Expense and Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Fair Value Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent), derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long term liabilities. The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Companys investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Companys derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where 151 Table of Contents derivatives qualify and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Companys interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Companys derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterpartys) and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Platts). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instruments fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on indicative pricing quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities The Company adopted the fair value measurement accounting guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009. The most significant of these estimates surround the fair value measurement of long lived tangible and intangible assets when tested for impairment upon a triggering event or during the annual impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill. These estimates include making assumptions regarding useful life, the impact of economic obsolescence and expected future cash flows. Additional factors are discussed above in the Impairments section. 152 Table of Contents Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard creates a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10 K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Risks Associated with our Disclosure Controls and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We completed the remediation of our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in 2008. However, our disclosure controls and procedures may not be effective in future periods if our judgments prove incorrect or new material weaknesses are identified. For each of the fiscal quarters since December 31, 2004 through September 30, 2008, our management reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard No. 5), or a combination of deficiencies, that adversely affects a companys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that for each of the fiscal quarters from December 31, 2004 through September 30, 2008, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that financial information that we are required to disclose in our reports under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately. To address these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, each time we prepared our annual and quarterly reports, we performed additional analyses and other post closing procedures. These 73 Table of Contents additional procedures were costly, time consuming and required us to dedicate a significant amount of our resources, including the time and attention of our senior management, toward the correction of these problems. Nevertheless, even with these additional procedures, the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting caused us to have errors in our financial statements and since 2003 we had to restate our annual financial statements six times to correct these errors. The material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting also caused us to delay the filing of certain quarterly and annual reports with the SEC to dates that went beyond the deadlines prescribed by the SECs rules to file such reports. We did not timely file with the SEC our quarterly and annual reports for the year ended December 31, 2005, our quarterly reports for the second and third quarters of 2005, our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2006, and our quarterly report for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Under SEC rules, failure to timely file these reports prohibited us for a period of twelve months from offering and selling our securities pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S 3, which impaired our ability to access the capital markets through the public sale of registered securities in a timely manner. The failure to file our annual and quarterly reports with the SEC in a timely fashion also resulted in covenant defaults under our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing certain of our outstanding debt securities. Such defaults required us to obtain a waiver from the lenders under the senior secured credit facility; however the default under the indentures was cured upon the filing of the reports within the permitted grace period. In addition to these problems, the material weaknesses in internal controls, the restatements of our financial statements and the delay in the filing of our annual and quarterly reports exposed us to other risks including, but not limited to: litigation or an expansion of the SECs informal inquiry into our restatements or the commencement of formal proceedings by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require us to incur significant legal expenses and other costs or to pay damages, fines or other penalties; negative publicity; ratings downgrades; inability to raise capital in the public markets and or private markets when desired or necessary; or the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the Company. Since December 31, 2008, our management has reported that all of our previously identified material weaknesses have been remediated and that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls have been effective. For a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls, see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in this Form 10 K. In making its assessment about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures, management had to make certain judgments and it is possible that any number of their judgments could prove to be incorrect and that our remediation efforts did not fully and completely cure the previously identified material weaknesses. There is also the possibility that there are other material weaknesses in our internal control that are unknown to us or that new material weaknesses may develop in the future. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting would subject us to all of the risks described above. Furthermore, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, changes in accounting practice or policy, or that the degree of compliance with the revised policies or procedures deteriorates over time. Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 74 Table of Contents In the future, we may be adversely impacted by the efforts required to adopt new accounting standards issued by the FASB as a result of the convergence of accounting standards project between the FASB and IASB The U.S Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB), which establishes accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) guidelines that companies follow in the United States, and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which is an international accounting standards setter outside of the United States, are presently engaged in a project to converge several accounting standards. The convergence project may result in the issuance of several new accounting standards in the future that revise existing GAAP accounting standards and which the Company may be required to adopt under GAAP. Based on the present timeline released by the FASB, several pronouncements could be issued in final form in 2011. Although the release of final pronouncements is not assured and the proposed adoption dates of these standards have not been set, each new standard that the Company must comply with may require significant effort to adopt. For each new standard, the Company will be required to evaluate the impact of any accounting changes necessitated by a new standard which will include, but not be limited to, an evaluation of a new standards impact on its financial statements and contractual arrangements; planning for and implementation of any changes to accounting systems; processes and procedures to ensure the Company properly complies with a new standard; and training personnel. To the extent that multiple standards are effective as of one date or in close proximity to one another, the Company may require considerable resources to achieve compliance with these new standards. An inability to complete these efforts prior to their effective date could have an adverse effect on our ability to timely file our financial statements with the SEC and or the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Risks Related to our High Level of Indebtedness We have a significant amount of debt, a large percentage of which is secured, which could adversely affect our business and the ability to fulfill our obligations. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $19.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. All outstanding borrowings under The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility and certain other indebtedness are secured by certain of our assets, including the pledge of capital stock of many of The AES Corporations directly held subsidiaries. Most of the debt of The AES Corporations subsidiaries is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. Since we have such a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in dealing with these secured assets. This high level of indebtedness and related security could have other important consequences to us and our investors, including: making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations at the holding company and or individual subsidiaries; increasing the likelihood of a downgrade of our debt, which could cause future debt costs and or payments to increase under our debt and related hedging instruments and consume an even greater portion of cash flow; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry conditions and economic conditions, including but not limited to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices; reducing the availability of cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and 75 Table of Contents limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock. The agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness. To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Accordingly, our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. See Note 10 Debt included in Item 8. of this Form 10 K for a schedule of our debt maturities. The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise. The AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. All of The AES Corporations revenue is generated through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, almost all of The AES Corporations cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporations ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise. However, our subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to The AES Corporation. Most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or project financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions to The AES Corporation. In addition, the payment of dividends or the making of loans, advances or other payments to The AES Corporation may be subject to other contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may limit the amount of retained earnings that may be distributed to us as a dividend. Subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to The AES Corporation as a result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. Any right that The AES Corporation has to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent right of the holders of The AES Corporations indebtedness to participate in the distribution of, or to realize proceeds from, those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of any such subsidiarys creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary). The AES Corporation could receive less funds than it expects as a result of the current challenges facing the global and local economies, which could impact the performance of our businesses and their ability to distribute cash to The AES Corporation. For further discussion of the macroeconomic environment and its impact on our business, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. The AES Corporations subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of The AES Corporations indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments. While some of The AES Corporations subsidiaries guarantee the Parents indebtedness under the Parents senior secured credit facility, none of its subsidiaries guarantee, or are otherwise obligated with respect to, its outstanding public debt securities. 76 Table of Contents Even though The AES Corporation is a holding company, existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect The AES Corporation. We attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents which, except as noted below, require the loans to be repaid solely from the projects revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. This type of financing is usually referred to as non recourse debt or project financing. In some project financings, The AES Corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which by their terms will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. These obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees, indemnities, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $19.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $4.6 billion was recourse debt of The AES Corporation and approximately $15.1 billion was non recourse debt. In addition, we have outstanding guarantees, letters of credit, and other credit support commitments which are further described in this Form 10 K in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity Parent Company Liquidity. Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010. While the lenders under our non recourse project financings generally do not have direct recourse to The AES Corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by The AES Corporation), defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for The AES Corporation, including, without limitation: reducing The AES Corporations receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to The AES Corporation during the pendency of any default; triggering The AES Corporations obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support which The AES Corporation has provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary; causing The AES Corporation to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; triggering defaults in The AES Corporations outstanding debt and trust preferred securities. For example, The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries; the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the Company; or foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the nonrecourse loans, therefore eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets. None of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that meet the applicable definition of materiality in The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of future mix of distributions, write down of assets, dispositions and other matters that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the applicable definition of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiarys debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility. The risk of such defaults may have increased as a result of the deteriorating global economy. For further 77 Table of Contents discussion of these conditions, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions of this Form 10 K. Risks Associated with our Ability to Raise Needed Capital The AES Corporation has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity. The AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund: principal repayments of debt; interest and preferred dividends; acquisitions; construction and other project commitments; other equity commitments, including business development investments; equity repurchases; taxes; and Parent Company overhead costs. The AES Corporations principal sources of liquidity are: dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level; and proceeds from asset sales. For a more detailed discussion of The AES Corporations cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity of this Form 10 K. While we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the Parent Company level for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. Any number of assumptions could prove to be incorrect and therefore there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. For example, in recent years, certain financial institutions have gone bankrupt. In the event that a bank who is party to our senior secured credit facility or other facilities goes bankrupt or is otherwise unable to fund its commitments, we would need to replace that bank in our syndicate or risk a reduction in the size of the facility, which would reduce our liquidity. In addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding under our credit facilities and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us. Our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to raise capital on favorable terms. From time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: general economic and capital market conditions; the availability of bank credit; 78 Table of Contents investor confidence; the financial condition, performance and prospects of The AES Corporation in general and or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing as well as companies in our industry or similar financial circumstances; and changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital. Should future access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants or expand or improve existing facilities, either of which would affect our future growth, results of operations or financial condition. A downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets which could increase our interest costs or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow. If any of the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs would increase. Furthermore, depending on The AES Corporations credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debt securities, counterparties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, The AES Corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporation. There can be no assurance that such counterparties will accept such guarantees or that AES could arrange such further assurances in the future. In addition, to the extent The AES Corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of credit available to The AES Corporation to meet its other liquidity needs. We may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund greenfield projects in certain less developed economies which could change or in some cases adversely affect our growth strategy. Part of our strategy is to grow our business by developing Generation and Utility businesses in less developed economies where the return on our investment may be greater than projects in more developed economies. Commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non recourse project financing in certain less developed economies, and in these situations we have sought and will continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. As a precondition to making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees of certain project and sovereign related risks. There can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the project or invest more of our own funds which may not be in line with our investment objectives and would leave less funds for other projects. These risks have increased as a result of the recent credit crisis and the deteriorating global economy. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential impact on the Company, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. External Risks Associated with Revenue and Earnings Volatility Our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Some of our businesses sell electricity in the wholesale spot markets in cases where they operate wholly or partially without long term power sales agreements. Our Generation and Utility businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in 79 Table of Contents those markets. The open market wholesale prices for electricity are very volatile and often reflect the fluctuating cost of coal, natural gas or oil. Consequently, any changes in the supply and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity. Volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from among other things: plant availability in the markets generally; availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties; competition; demand for energy commodities; electricity usage; seasonality; interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuation; availability and price of emission credits; input prices; hydrology and other weather conditions; illiquid markets; transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies; availability of competitively priced renewables sources; available supplies of natural gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal; generating unit performance; natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events; energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies; geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas; and general economic conditions in areas where we operate which impact energy consumption. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entitys functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. Dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the United States are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. Dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currencies where our subsidiaries outside the United States report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiarys functional currency. We also experience foreign transaction exposure to the extent monetary assets and liabilities, including debt, are in a different currency than the subsidiarys functional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial position and results of operations have been affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies, primarily the Euro, Brazilian real, Argentine peso, Chilean peso, Colombian peso and Philippine peso. 80 Table of Contents We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. We routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us hedge our interest rate exposure on variable rate debt. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management procedures we have in place may not always be followed or may not work as planned. In particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management system may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with basis risk which is the assumed relative correlation of performance between the intended hedge instrument and the targeted underlying exposure. Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform their obligations under these arrangements. In 2010, we faced substantial challenges in North America as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place but purchase fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. In particular, our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas have been affected by these conditions. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Impairments. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks. We often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could be lower than contracted prices and would expose these businesses to considerable price volatility. At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facilitys output, in some cases under long term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. We have also hedged a portion of our exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price power sales. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. If we were unable to enter into replacement PPAs, these businesses may have to sell power at market prices. 81 Table of Contents The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to The AES Corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. The market pricing of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in future periods. The market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future. Stock price movements on a quarter by quarter basis for the past two years are set forth in Item 5. Market Market Information of this Form 10 K. Factors that could affect the price of our common stock in the future include general conditions in our industry, in the power markets in which we participate and in the world, including environmental and economic developments, over which we have no control, as well as developments specific to us, including, risks that could result in revenue and earnings volatility as well as other risk factors described in this Item 1A. Risk Factors and those matters described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Risks Associated with our Operations We do a significant amount of business outside the United States, including in developing countries, which presents significant risks. A significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the United States and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. Part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in developing countries because the growth rates and the opportunity to implement operating improvements and achieve higher operating margins may be greater than those typically achievable in more developed countries. International operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region; adverse changes in currency exchange rates; government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds; unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies; high inflation and monetary fluctuations; restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate; threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments; difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with GAAP expertise; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties; inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems; adverse changes in government tax policy; 82 Table of Contents difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions. Any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, partly in response to challenging business and political conditions in Kazakhstan, in 2008, we sold certain businesses in that country. As another example, in the second quarter of 2007, we sold our stake in EDC to Petr&oacute;leos de Venezuela, S.A., the state owned energy company in Venezuela after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened to expropriate the electricity business in Venezuela. In connection with the sale, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $680 million. In addition, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenues and gross margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. The operation of power generation and distribution facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results. We and or our subsidiaries may not have adequate insurance coverage for liabilities. We are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including: changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, explosions, terrorist acts or other similar occurrences; and changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to: gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance. Our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations, or interruptions in transportation including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. This could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurring a liability for liquidated damages and or other penalties. As a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation and distribution industries, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to 83 Table of Contents transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or certain external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks. The hazards described above can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A claim for which we are not fully insured or insured at all could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our businesses insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with its operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results or operations, financial condition and prospects. Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our inability to attract and retain skilled people could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. In particular, we routinely are required to assess the financial and tax impacts of complicated business transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. These assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise in GAAP to timely and accurately comply with United States reporting obligations. An inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse affect on our financial and tax reporting. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for load requirements and may result in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. The uncertainty regarding the amount of power that our power generation and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our operating costs. A significant under or over estimation of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much power to cover their obligations, in which case we would be required to buy or sell power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. Those prices may not be favorable and thus could increase our operating costs. 84 Table of Contents We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. Even when we successfully enter into long term contracts, our generation businesses are often dependent on one or a limited number of customers and a limited number of fuel suppliers. Many of our generation plants conduct business under long term contracts. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plants output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts range from 1 to 25 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable. For example, during the past several years, various governmental authorities in Europe have terminated or declined to fulfill their obligations under long term contracts with our subsidiaries. In 2008, as part of the accession to the European Union, the Hungarian government terminated all long term PPAs, including AES Tiszas PPA, as of December 31, 2008. Partly as a result of the termination AES Tiszas results of operations declined and we were required to record an $85 million asset impairment charge for AES Tisza in the third quarter of 2010. Kilroot in Northern Ireland received notice from the Utility Regulator directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the Generating Unit Agreements for the two coal fired units effective November 1, 2010 and, as a result, the performance (and contributions to income and cash flow) from Kilroot will decline in 2011 when compared to prior years. Furthermore, these businesses (and any other businesses whose long term contracts may be challenged) may have to sell electricity into the spot markets. Because of the volatile nature of inputs and power prices, the inability to secure long term contracts could generate increased volatility in our earnings and cash flows and could generate substantial losses (or result in a write down of assets), which could have a material impact on our business and results of operations. We have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customers obligations. However, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment grade credit rating, and our Generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful. These risks have increased as a result of the deteriorating and volatile global economy. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential impact on the Company, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions in this Form 10 K. Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us. The power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain 85 Table of Contents markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas fired power plants have also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on us. Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions. Certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Of the twenty nine defined benefit plans, three are at United States subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. The Company periodically evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. The Companys exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans are more heavily weighted to investments in fixed income securities that have not been as severely impacted by the global recession. Future downturns in the debt and or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. Our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. This may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the Parent Company and our subsidiaries liquidity. For additional information regarding the funding position of the Companys pension plans, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Pension and Postretirement Obligations and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K. Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties. Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing greenfield power plants, some but not all of which have signed long term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to failures of siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. Timing of equipment purchases can also pose financial risks to the Company. As part of our development process, we attempt to make purchases of equipment and or materials as needed. However, from time to time, there may be excess demand for certain types of equipment with substantial delays between the time we place orders and receive delivery. In those instances, to avoid construction delays and costs associated with the inability to own and place such equipment and or materials into service when needed in the construction process, we may place orders well in advance of deployment. In some cases, we may order such equipment and or materials without yet having a specific project where the equipment and or materials will be deployed, in anticipation that equipment and materials will be needed at the time of delivery. However, there is a risk that at the time of delivery, we are required to accept delivery and pay for such equipment and or materials, even though no project has materialized where these items will be used. This can result in our having to incur material equipment and or material costs, with no deployment plan at delivery. Financing risk has also increased as a result of the deterioration of the global economy and the crisis in the financial markets and, as a result, we may forgo certain development opportunities. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are 86 Table of Contents recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, management believes that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this timeframe. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. Historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses may be government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that: we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership; such businesses will perform as expected; integration or other one time costs will not be greater than expected; we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities; such business will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest our capital to acquire them. 87 Table of Contents In some of our joint venture projects and businesses, we have granted protective rights to minority holders or we own less than a majority of the equity in the project or business and do not manage or otherwise control the project or business, which entails certain risks. We have invested in some joint ventures where we own less than a majority of the voting equity in the venture. Very often, one of our subsidiaries seeks to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of projects or businesses in which we have less than a majority of the ownership interests by operating the project or business pursuant to a management contract, negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we do not always have this type of control over the project or business in every instance; and we may be dependent on our co venturers to operate such projects or businesses. Our co venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally. The approval of co venturers also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. In some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders. For example, Companhia Brasiliana de Energia (Brasiliana) is a holding company in which we have a controlling equity interest and through which we own three of our four Brazilian businesses: Eletropaulo, Tiet&ecirc; and Uruguaiana. We entered into a shareholders agreement with an affiliate of the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) which owns more than 49% of the voting equity of Brasiliana. Among other things, the shareholders agreement requires the consent of both parties before taking certain corporate actions, grants both parties rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of interests in Brasiliana and grants certain drag along rights to BNDES. In May 2007, BNDES notified us that it intends to sell all of its interest in Brasiliana pursuant to a public auction (the Brasiliana Sale). BNDES also informed us that if we fail to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of its interest in Brasiliana, then BNDES intends to exercise its drag along rights under the shareholders agreement and cause us to sell all of our interests in Brasiliana in the Brasiliana Sale as well. BNDES has since suspended the auction; however, BNDES may determine to recommence a sale process in the future. In that event, after the auction, if a third party offer has been received in the Brasiliana Sale, we will have 30 days to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of BNDESs interest in Brasiliana on the same terms as the third party offer. If we do not exercise this right and BNDES proceeds to exercise its drag along rights, then we may be forced to sell all of our interest in Brasiliana. Due to the uncertainty in the sale price at this point in time, we are uncertain whether we will exercise our right of first refusal should BNDES receive a valid third party offer in the Brasiliana Sale and, if we do, whether we would do it alone or with joint venture partners. Even if we desire to exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot assure that we will have the cash on hand or that debt or equity financing will be available at acceptable terms in order to purchase BNDESs interest in Brasiliana. If we do not exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot be assured that we will not have to record a loss if the sale price is below the book value of our investment in Brasiliana. Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and regulatory challenges. AES Wind Generation, AES Solar, our greenhouse gas emissions reductions projects (GHG Emissions Reduction Projects), and our investments in projects such as energy storage are subject to substantial risks. Projects of this nature have been developed through advancement in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and which are unrelated to our core business. Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future. For example, several European countries have recently faced a debt crisis, which has or may result in government austerity measures. If these incentives are repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, this could materially impact our renewable businesses, results of operations and financial condition, and impact the ability of the affected 88 Table of Contents businesses to continue or grow their operations. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries, which could also have a material impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, production levels for our wind, solar, and GHG Emissions Reduction Projects may be dependent upon adequate wind, sunlight, or biogas production which can vary significantly from period to period, resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. For example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year. With regard to GHG Emissions Reduction Projects, there is particular uncertainty about whether agreements providing incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, such as the Kyoto Protocol, will continue and whether countries around the world will enact or maintain legislation that provides incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, without which such projects may not be economical or financing for such projects may become unavailable. As a result, renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. In addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in Generation and Utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that many of these projects exist in new or emerging markets, where long term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. These projects can be capital intensive and generally require that we obtain third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects. These risks may be exacerbated by the current global economic crisis, including our managements increased focus on liquidity, which may also result in slower growth in the number of projects we can pursue. The economic downturn could also impact the value of our assets in these countries and our ability to develop these projects. If the value of these assets decline, this could result in a material impairment or a series of impairments which are material in the aggregate, which would adversely affect our financial statements. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or long lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. The fair value of a reporting unit has been determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill outside of the required annual assessment process if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. There could also be impairments if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. See further discussion in Risk Factor, Our Acquisitions May Not Perform as Expected. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. As of December 31, 2010, we had $1.3 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3% of total assets. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to 89 Table of Contents impair goodwill, as further described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Long lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives. Long lived assets are evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of long lived assets, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates, commodity prices and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. Generally, the fair value of a long lived asset or asset group is determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each asset group. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or adverse action or assessment by a regulator. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in additional long lived asset impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to impair long lived assets, as further described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather. Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In the past, our businesses in Latin America have been negatively impacted by lower than normal rainfall. Similarly, our wind businesses are dependent on adequate wind conditions while the solar projects at AES Solar are dependent on sufficient sunlight. In each case, inadequate wind or sunlight could have a material adverse impact on these businesses. Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes. Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our Utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to: changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations; 90 Table of Contents changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utilitys operating income or the rates it charges customers is too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates; changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non controllable costs; adverse changes in tax law; changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium; changes in the timing of tariff increases; other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business. Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business. In many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing or the regulations can be difficult to interpret. As a result, there is risk that we may not properly interpret certain regulations and may not understand the impact of certain regulations on our business. For example, in October 2006, ANEEL, which regulates our utility operations at Sul and Eletropaulo in Brazil, issued Normative Resolution 234 requiring that utilities begin amortizing a liability called Special Obligations beginning with their second tariff reset cycle in 2007 or a later year as an offset to depreciation expense. As of May 23, 2007, the date of the filing of our 2006 Form 10 K, no industry positions or any other consensus had been reached regarding how ANEEL guidance should be applied at that date and accordingly, no adjustments to the financial statements were made relating to Special Obligations in Brazil. Subsequent to May 23, 2007, industry discussions occurred and other Brazilian companies filed Forms 20 F with the SEC reflecting the impact of Resolution 234 in their December 31, 2006 financial statements differently from how the Company accounted for Resolution 234. In the absence of any significant regulatory developments between May 23, 2007 and the date of these other filings, the Company determined that Resolution 234 required us to record an adjustment to our Special Obligations liability as of December 31, 2006. In part, the decision to record the adjustment led to the restatement of our financial statements in the third quarter of 2007. If we face additional challenges interpreting regulations or changes in regulations, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act). While the bulk of regulations contained in the Dodd Frank Act regulate financial institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive compensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to public companies generally. The types of provisions described above are currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Furthermore, while the Dodd Frank Act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, the Dodd Frank Act provides for commercial end user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions, though this is not certain since the Act directs the SEC, CFTC and listed companies to enact rules that will clarify the Dodd Frank Act, and such rulemaking could impact the availability of the commercial end user exemption. Even if the exemption is available, the Dodd Frank Act could still have a material adverse impact on the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non exempt companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these risks. Even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, which could adversely affect the operating results of certain projects; cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated to hedge certain risks, such as project financing agreements; prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; cause the Company to abandon certain of its hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; and or consume substantial liquidity by forcing the Company to post cash and or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 91 Table of Contents On June 12, 2009 AES Kelanitissa received a letter and an invoice from the Director General, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUC) seeking payment of an Annual Regulatory Fee and pursuant to PUC assurances on an application for renewal of the AES Kelanitissa generation license. The application is pursuant to an April 2009 revision of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act (Electricity Act), which came into force in April 2009, notwithstanding that in March 29, 2001, AES Kelanitissa had been granted, and pre paid fees for, a 21 year generation license with effect from September 25, 2000 under the Electricity Act, 1950. AES Kelanitissa submitted an application to be licensed under the revised legislation and, on August 26, 2009, PUC published its intention to issue a generation license under the revised legislation to AES Kelanitissa and other Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in Sri Lanka. This was consistent with assurances received from relevant authorities that the revised legislation was to be amended to grandfather IPPs with existing generation licenses. In a letter dated June 21, 2010 from the PUC, AES Kelanitissa was informed that under the new regulations, as amended in 2009, AES Kelanitissa (Pvt) Ltd no longer fulfilled the eligibility criteria to apply for a generation license. The eligibility criteria to which the letter refers is a provision requiring an element of state ownership. Representatives of AES Kelanitissa have been informed that an amendment to the Electricity Act to grandfather existing IPPs remains in the legislative pipeline, although it is not possible to predict with certainty when or whether such an amendment will be passed. In addition, AES Kelanitissa believes that under Sri Lankan law, it may continue operations under the 21 year license issued in 2001. No step has been taken to date to prohibit AES Kelanitissa from generating power and conducting its operations. However, in the event that it is determined that AES Kelanitissa may not operate under its current license or the revised legislation is not amended (and PUC maintains that AES Kelanitissa is ineligible for a generation license or extension of the Generating License), AES Kelanitissa may not be able to continue operations on grounds that it has no license under the revised legislation. In that event, AES Kelanitissa and or the Company could face a number of adverse consequences, including potential litigation with counterparties mitigating a write down in the value of the assets of the business, continued default status under its debt documents and or other consequences which could have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Our Generation business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the FERC, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations. EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the obligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of the Midwest Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) Interconnection, L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is authorized under the new law to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case by case basis. While the new law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to PURPA, our QFs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long term contracts expire. EPAct 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the United States generation market. 92 Table of Contents In accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets. While the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost of service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate. Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our activities are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air and water emissions. See the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters of this Form 10 K. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies. The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal fired generating plants alleging wide spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with approximately 17 companies over such allegations. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. The principal focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO2 and NOX. In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOX. One of our businesses, IPL, is currently the subject of such an EPA enforcement action, and another business, Eastern Energy, has received an information request from the EPA in connection with a possible enforcement action. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10 K for more detail with respect to these EPA enforcement actions and information requests. There can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations. 93 Table of Contents Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As discussed in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations, at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect or policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2010, the Companys subsidiaries operated businesses which had total approximate CO2 emissions of 77.2 million metric tonnes approximately 40 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 18 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based upon a number of projections and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect such as the forecast dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO2 emissions and our subsidiaries achieving completion of such construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with emissions described below. Because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates. The subsidiaries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there can be no assurance that the subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the Company. Foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial performance. The actual impact on the Companys financial performance and the financial performance of the Companys subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the cost of emissions reduction equipment the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material impact on our results of operations. In January 2005, based on European Community Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading, the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) commenced operation as the largest multi country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the 40 developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO2. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In the United States, there currently is no legislation establishing federal mandatory GHG emission reduction programs (including CO2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. However, federal GHG legislation has been proposed in the United States Congress that would, if enacted, constrain GHG emissions, including CO2, and or impose costs on 94 Table of Contents us that could be material to our business or results of operations. The EPA has also initiated regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new sources of GHG emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing sources planning physical changes that would increase their GHG emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. Such regulations could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse effect on our business and or results of operations. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regulations. At the state level, RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast, became effective in January 2009, and the WCI is also developing market based programs to address GHG emissions in seven western states. In addition, several states, including California, have adopted comprehensive legislation that, when effective, will require mandatory GHG reductions from several industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about the United States state environmental regulations we face. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below), the Company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with United States federal, regional or state CO2 emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that these proposals are in earlier stages of development and any final regulations or legislation, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. The RGGI program became effective in January 2009. The first regional auction of RGGI allowances needed to be acquired by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI was held in September 2008, with subsequent auctions occurring approximately every quarter. Our subsidiaries in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland are subject to RGGI. Of the approximately 40 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2010 (ownership adjusted), approximately 11.3 million metric tonnes were emitted in United States states participating in RGGI. Over the past three years, such emissions have averaged approximately 10.9 million metric tonnes. While CO2 emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of CO2 compliance based on a 3 year average of CO2 emissions for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes a price of $1.86 per allowance under RGGI. The source of this allowance price estimate was the clearing price in the recent RGGI allowance auction held in December 2010. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $15 million for 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance. In addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. For example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. In addition, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. In addition, environmental groups and other private plaintiffs have brought and may decide to bring additional private lawsuits against the Company because of its subsidiaries GHG emissions. The Company is facing and may face in the future private lawsuits relating to GHG emissions that may have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. In one recent case in the United States, which does not involve the Company, a federal appellate court reversed the dismissal by a federal district court of nuisance and other claims against emitters of GHG based on property damage allegedly caused by their contributions to global warming. While the scope of relief sought in that case is 95 Table of Contents unclear, the plaintiffs in this case evidently seek injunctive relief to prevent or reduce further GHG emissions. The defendants appealed the appellate court decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court is expected to render a decision in 2011. If the defendants do not prevail, other parties may be encouraged to bring similar suits against electric power generators, including the Company or any of its United States subsidiaries. Also, unless the United States Congress acts to preempt such suits as part of comprehensive federal legislation, additional lawsuits may be brought against the Company or its subsidiaries. At this stage of the litigation, it is impossible to predict whether such lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the Companys business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Companys subsidiaries. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel fired electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation. In addition to potential physical risks noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of the Company and its subsidiaries due to public perception of GHG emissions by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHG emissions made by subsidiaries of the Company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the Company. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the Companys subsidiaries and on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our subsidiaries have operations in the United States and various non United States jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many non United States jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as non United States, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities. We and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. We and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. 96 Table of Contents The SEC is conducting an informal inquiry relating to our restatements. We have been cooperating with an informal inquiry by the SEC Staff concerning our past restatements and related matters, and have been providing information and documents to the SEC Staff on a voluntary basis. Although we have not received correspondence regarding this inquiry for some time, we have not been advised that the matter is closed. Because we are unable to predict the outcome of this inquiry, the SEC Staff may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported the financial impact of the adjustments to previously filed financial statements and there may be a risk that the inquiry by the SEC could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate previously filed financial statements, amend prior filings or take other actions not currently contemplated. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We maintain offices in many places around the world, generally pursuant to the provisions of long and short term leases, none of which we believe are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are described in Item 1 of this Form 10 K, are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the projects related finance facility. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased. However, in a few instances, no accompanying project financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business, some of which are described below. The Company has accrued for litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has evaluated claims in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies that it deems both probable and reasonably estimable and accordingly, has recorded aggregate reserves for all claims for approximately $450 million and $482 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. These are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within accrued and other liabilities and other long term liabilities. A significant portion of these reserves relate to employment, non income tax and customer disputes in international jurisdictions, principally Brazil. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries, principally in Brazil, are defendants in a number of labor and employment lawsuits. The complaints generally seek unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or other relief. The subsidiaries have denied any liability and intend to vigorously defend themselves in all of these proceedings. There can be no assurance that this reserve will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise. The Company believes, based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. However, even where no reserve has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company, and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material. In 1989, Centrais El&eacute;tricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobr&aacute;s) filed suit in the Fifth District Court in the State of Rio de Janeiro against Eletropaulo Eletricidade de S&atilde;o Paulo S.A. (EEDSP) relating to the methodology for calculating monetary adjustments under the parties financing agreement. In April 1999, the Fifth District Court 97 Table of Contents found for Eletrobr&aacute;s and in September 2001, Eletrobr&aacute;s initiated an execution suit in the Fifth District Court to collect approximately R$1.10 billion ($659 million) from Eletropaulo (as estimated by Eletropaulo) and a lesser amount from an unrelated company, Companhia de Transmiss&atilde;o de Energia El&eacute;trica Paulista (CTEEP) (Eletropaulo and CTEEP were spun off from EEDSP pursuant to its privatization in 1998). In November 2002, the Fifth District Court rejected Eletropaulos defenses in the execution suit. Eletropaulo appealed and in September 2003, the Appellate Court of the State of Rio de Janeiro (AC) ruled that Eletropaulo was not a proper party to the litigation because any alleged liability had been transferred to CTEEP pursuant to the privatization. In June 2006, the Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) reversed the Appellate Courts decision and remanded the case to the Fifth District Court for further proceedings, holding that Eletropaulos liability, if any, should be determined by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulos subsequent appeals to the Special Court (the highest court within the SCJ) and the Supreme Court of Brazil were dismissed. Eletrobr&aacute;s later requested that the amount of Eletropaulos alleged debt be determined by an accounting expert appointed by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulo consented to the appointment of such an expert, subject to a reservation of rights. In February 2010, the Fifth District Court appointed an accounting expert to determine the amount of the alleged debt and the responsibility for its payment in light of the privatization, in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletrobr&aacute;s. Pursuant to its reservation of rights, Eletropaulo filed an interlocutory appeal with the AC asserting that the expert was required to determine the issues in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletropaulo, and that Eletropaulo should be entitled to take discovery and present arguments on the issues to be determined by the expert. In April 2010, the AC issued a decision agreeing with Eletropaulos arguments and directing the Fifth District Court to proceed accordingly. Eletrobr&aacute;s may restart the accounting proceedings at the Fifth District Court at any time, which would proceed according to the ACs April 2010 decision. In the Fifth District Court proceedings, the experts conclusions will be subject to the Fifth District Courts review and approval. If Eletropaulo is determined to be responsible for the debt, after the amount of the alleged debt is determined, Eletrobr&aacute;s will be entitled to resume the execution suit in the Fifth District Court at any time. If Eletrobr&aacute;s does so, Eletropaulo will be required to provide security in the amount of its alleged liability. In that case, if Eletrobr&aacute;s requests the seizure of such security and the Fifth District Court grants such request, Eletropaulos results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and in turn the Companys results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, in February 2008, CTEEP filed a lawsuit in the Fifth District Court against Eletrobr&aacute;s and Eletropaulo seeking a declaration that CTEEP is not liable for any debt under the financing agreement. The parties are disputing the proper venue for the CTEEP lawsuit. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In August 2000, the FERC announced an investigation into the organized California wholesale power markets to determine whether rates were just and reasonable. Further investigations involved alleged market manipulation. FERC requested documents from each of the AES Southland, LLC plants and AES Placerita, Inc. AES Southland and AES Placerita have cooperated fully with the FERC investigations. AES Southland was not subject to refund liability because it did not sell into the organized spot markets due to the nature of its tolling agreement. After hearings at FERC, AES Placerita was found subject to refund liability of $588,000 plus interest for spot sales to the California Power Exchange from October 2, 2000 to June 20, 2001. As FERC investigations and hearings progressed, numerous appeals on related issues were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Over the years, the Ninth Circuit issued several opinions that had the potential to expand the scope of the FERC proceedings and increase refund exposure for AES Placerita and other sellers of electricity. Following remand of one of the Ninth Circuit appeals in March 2009, FERC started a new hearing process involving AES Placerita and other sellers. In May 2009, AES Placerita entered into a settlement, approved by FERC in July 2009, concerning the claims before FERC against AES Placerita relating to the California energy crisis of 2000 2001, including the California refund proceeding. Pursuant to the settlement, AES Placerita paid $6 million and assigned a receivable of $168,119 due to it from the California Power Exchange in return for a release of all claims against it at FERC by the settling parties and other consideration. More than 98% of the buyers in the market elected to join the settlement. A small amount of AES Placeritas settlement payment was placed in escrow for buyers that did not join the settlement (non settling parties). It is unclear whether the escrowed funds will be enough to satisfy any additional sums that might be determined to be owed to 98 Table of Contents non settling parties at the conclusion of the FERC proceedings concerning the California energy crisis. However, any such additional sums are expected to be immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2009, one non settling party, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), filed an appeal of the FERCs approval of the settlement which is pending in the Ninth Circuit. SMUDs appeal has been stayed pending further order of the court. The settlement agreement is still effective and will continue to remain effective unless it is vacated by the Ninth Circuit. SMUD has reached a settlement in principal with buyers of electricity that, if approved by FERC, will leave only immaterial claims of non settling parties against AES Placerita. In August 2001, the Grid Corporation of Orissa, India, now Gridco Ltd. (Gridco), filed a petition against the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (CESCO), an affiliate of the Company, with the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC), alleging that CESCO had defaulted on its obligations as an OERC licensed distribution company, that CESCO management abandoned the management of CESCO, and asking for interim measures of protection, including the appointment of an administrator to manage CESCO. Gridco, a state owned entity, is the sole wholesale energy provider to CESCO. Pursuant to the OERCs August 2001 order, the management of CESCO was replaced with a government administrator who was appointed by the OERC. The OERC later held that the Company and other CESCO shareholders were not necessary or proper parties to the OERC proceeding. In August 2004, the OERC issued a notice to CESCO, the Company and others giving the recipients of the notice until November 2004 to show cause why CESCOs distribution license should not be revoked. In response, CESCO submitted a business plan to the OERC. In February 2005, the OERC issued an order rejecting the proposed business plan. The order also stated that the CESCO distribution license would be revoked if an acceptable business plan for CESCO was not submitted to and approved by the OERC prior to March 31, 2005. In its April 2, 2005 order, the OERC revoked the CESCO distribution license. CESCO has filed an appeal against the April 2, 2005 OERC order and that appeal remains pending in the Indian courts. In addition, Gridco asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Companys indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCOs financial obligations to Gridco. In December 2001, Gridco served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limited (AES ODPL), and Jyoti Structures (Jyoti) pursuant to the terms of the CESCO Shareholders Agreement between Gridco, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and CESCO (the CESCO arbitration). In the arbitration, Gridco appeared to be seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by Gridco. The Company counterclaimed against Gridco for damages. In June 2007, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting Gridcos claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to Gridco. The respondents counterclaims were also rejected. In September 2007, Gridco filed a challenge of the arbitration award with the local Indian court. In June 2008, Gridco filed a separate application with the local Indian court for an order enjoining the Company from selling or otherwise transferring its shares in Orissa Power Generation Corporation Ltd.s (OPGC), an equity method investment, and requiring the Company to provide security in the amount of the contested damages in the CESCO arbitration until Gridcos challenge to the arbitration award is resolved. In June 2010, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal awarded the Company some of its costs relating to the arbitration. In August 2010, Gridco filed a challenge of the cost award with the local Indian court. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In early 2002, Gridco made an application to the OERC requesting that the OERC initiate proceedings regarding the terms of OPGCs existing PPA with Gridco. In response, OPGC filed a petition in the Indian courts to block any such OERC proceedings. In early 2005, the Orissa High Court upheld the OERCs jurisdiction to initiate such proceedings as requested by Gridco. OPGC appealed that High Courts decision to the Supreme Court and sought stays of both the High Courts decision and the underlying OERC proceedings regarding the PPAs terms. In April 2005, the Supreme Court granted OPGCs requests and ordered stays of the High Courts decision and the OERC proceedings with respect to the PPAs terms. The matter is awaiting further hearing. 99 Table of Contents Unless the Supreme Court finds in favor of OPGCs appeal or otherwise prevents the OERCs proceedings regarding the PPAs terms, the OERC will likely lower the tariff payable to OPGC under the PPA, which would have an adverse impact on OPGCs financials. OPGC believes that it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In March 2003, the office of the Federal Public Prosecutor for the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (MPF) notified AES Eletropaulo that it had commenced an inquiry related to the BNDES financings provided to AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and the rationing loan provided to Eletropaulo, changes in the control of Eletropaulo, sales of assets by Eletropaulo and the quality of service provided by Eletropaulo to its customers, and requested various documents from Eletropaulo relating to these matters. In July 2004, the MPF filed a public civil lawsuit in the Federal Court of S&atilde;o Paulo (FSCP) alleging that BNDES violated Law 8429/92 (the Administrative Misconduct Act) and BNDESs internal rules by: (1) approving the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (2) extending the payment terms on the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (3) authorizing the sale of Eletropaulos preferred shares at a stock market auction; (4) accepting Eletropaulos preferred shares to secure the loan provided to Eletropaulo; and (5) allowing the restructurings of Light Servi&ccedil;os de Eletricidade S.A. and Eletropaulo. The MPF also named AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s as defendants in the lawsuit because they allegedly benefited from BNDESs alleged violations. In May 2006, the FCSP ruled that the MPF could pursue its claims based on the first, second, and fourth alleged violations noted above. The MPF subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal with the Federal Court of Appeals (FCA) seeking to require the FCSP to consider all five alleged violations. Also, in July 2006, AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s filed an interlocutory appeal with the FCA, which was subsequently consolidated with the MPFs interlocutory appeal, seeking a transfer of venue and to enjoin the FCSP from considering any of the alleged violations. In June 2009, the FCA granted the injunction sought by AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and transferred the case to the Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro. In May 2010, the MPF filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice challenging the transfer. The MPFs lawsuit before the FCSP has been stayed pending a final decision on the interlocutory appeals. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana (the successor of AES Transg&aacute;s) believe they have meritorious defenses to the allegations asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. AES Florestal, Ltd. (Florestal), had been operating a pole factory and had other assets, including a wooded area known as Horto Renner, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (collectively, Property). Florestal had been under the control of AES Sul (Sul) since October 1997, when Sul was created pursuant to a privatization by the Government of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. After it came under the control of Sul, Florestal performed an environmental audit of the entire operational cycle at the pole factory. The audit discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at the pole factory. The audit concluded that the prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia El&eacute;trica (CEEE), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. Sul and Florestal subsequently took the initiative of communicating with Brazilian authorities, as well as CEEE, about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. The Public Attorneys Office has initiated a civil inquiry (Civil Inquiry n. 24/05) to investigate potential civil liability and has requested that the police station of Triunfo institute a police investigation (IP number 1041/05) to investigate potential criminal liability regarding the contamination at the pole factory. The parties filed defenses in response to the civil inquiry. The Public Attorneys Office then requested an injunction which the judge rejected on September 26, 2008. The Public Attorneys office has a right to appeal the decision. The environmental agency (FEPAM) has also started a procedure (Procedure n. 088200567/059) to analyze the measures that shall be taken to contain and remediate the contamination. Also, in March 2000, Sul filed suit against CEEE in the 2nd Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre seeking to register in Suls name the Property that it acquired through the privatization but that remained registered in CEEEs name. During those proceedings, AES subsequently waived its claim to re register the Property and asserted a claim to recover the amounts paid for the Property. That claim is pending. In November 2005, the 7th Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre ruled that the Property must be returned to CEEE. CEEE has had sole possession of Horto Renner since September 2006 and of the rest of the Property since April 2006. In February 2008, Sul 100 Table of Contents and CEEE signed a Technical Cooperation Protocol pursuant to which they requested a new deadline from FEPAM in order to present a proposal. In March 2008, the State Prosecution office filed a Public Class Action against AES Florestal, AES Sul and CEEE, requiring an injunction for the removal of the alleged sources of contamination and the payment of an indemnity in the amount of R$6 million ($4 million). The injunction was rejected and the case is in the evidentiary stage awaiting the judges determination concerning the production of expert evidence. The above referenced proposal was delivered on April 8, 2008. FEPAM responded by indicating that the parties should undertake the first step of the proposal which would be to retain a contractor. In its response, Sul indicated that such step should be undertaken by CEEE as the relevant environmental events resulted from CEEEs operations. It is estimated that remediation could cost approximately R$14.7 million ($9 million). Discussions between Sul and CEEE are ongoing. In January 2004, the Company received notice of a Formulation of Charges filed against the Company by the Superintendence of Electricity of the Dominican Republic. In the Formulation of Charges, the Superintendence asserts that the existence of three generation companies (Empresa Generadora de Electricidad Itabo, S.A. (Itabo), Dominican Power Partners, and AES Andres BV) and one distribution company (Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S.A. (Este)) in the Dominican Republic, violates certain cross ownership restrictions contained in the General Electricity Law of the Dominican Republic. In February 2004, the Company filed in the First Instance Court of the National District of the Dominican Republic an action seeking injunctive relief based on several constitutional due process violations contained in the Formulation of Charges (Constitutional Injunction). In February 2004, the Court granted the Constitutional Injunction and ordered the immediate cessation of any effects of the Formulation of Charges, and the enactment by the Superintendence of Electricity of a special procedure to prosecute alleged antitrust complaints under the General Electricity Law. In March 2004, the Superintendence of Electricity appealed the Courts decision. In July 2004, the Company divested any interest in Este. The Superintendence of Electricitys appeal is pending. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July 2004, the Corporaci&oacute;n Dominicana de Empresas El&eacute;ctricas Estatales (CDEEE) filed lawsuits against Itabo, an affiliate of the Company, in the First and Fifth Chambers of the Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance for the National District. CDEEE alleges in both lawsuits that Itabo spent more than was necessary to rehabilitate two generation units of an Itabo power plant and, in the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, that those funds were paid to affiliates and subsidiaries of AES Gener and Coastal Itabo, Ltd. (Coastal), a former shareholder of Itabo, without the required approval of Itabos board of administration. In the First Chamber lawsuit, CDEEE seeks an accounting of Itabos transactions relating to the rehabilitation. In November 2004, the First Chamber dismissed the case for lack of legal basis. On appeal, in October 2005 the Court of Appeals of Santo Domingo ruled in Itabos favor, reasoning that it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute because the parties contracts mandated arbitration. The Supreme Court of Justice is considering CDEEEs appeal of the Court of Appeals decision. In the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, which also names Itabos former president as a defendant, CDEEE seeks $15 million in damages and the seizure of Itabos assets. In October 2005, the Fifth Chamber held that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute given the arbitration provisions in the parties contracts. The First Chamber of the Court of Appeal ratified that decision in September 2006. In a related proceeding, in May 2005, Itabo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to compel CDEEE to arbitrate its claims. The petition was denied in July 2005. Itabos appeal of that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has been stayed since September 2006. Further, in September 2006, in an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration, an arbitral tribunal determined that it lacked jurisdiction to decide arbitration claims concerning these disputes. Itabo believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In April 2006, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi (District Court) on behalf of certain individual plaintiffs and all residents and or property owners in the State of Mississippi who allegedly suffered harm as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, whose alleged greenhouse gas emissions contributed to alleged global 101 Table of Contents warming which, in turn, allegedly increased the destructive capacity of Hurricane Katrina. The plaintiffs assert unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy/aiding and abetting, public and private nuisance, trespass, negligence, and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment claims against the defendants. The plaintiffs seek damages relating to loss of property, loss of business, clean up costs, personal injuries and death, but do not quantify their alleged damages. In August 2007, the District Court dismissed the case. The plaintiffs subsequently appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which, in October 2009, affirmed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs unjust enrichment, fraudulent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy claims. However, the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence claims, and remanded those claims to the District Court for further proceedings. In February 2010, the Fifth Circuit granted the petitions for en banc rehearing filed by the Company and other defendants, and thereby vacated its October 2009 decision. In May 2010, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had lost its quorum for en banc review. In August 2010, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the U.S. Supreme Court, requesting the Supreme Court to direct the Fifth Circuit to reinstate the appeal and return it to the panel that issued the October 2009 decision. In January 2011, the Supreme Court denied the petition, ending the case. In July 2007, the Competition Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the Competition Committee) ordered Nurenergoservice, an AES subsidiary, to pay approximately KZT 18 billion ($120 million) for alleged antimonopoly violations in 2005 through the first quarter of 2007. The Competition Committees order was affirmed by the economic court in April 2008 (April 2008 Decision). The economic court also issued an injunction to secure Nurenergoservices alleged liability, freezing Nurenergoservices bank accounts and prohibiting Nurenergoservice from transferring or disposing of its property. Nurenergoservices subsequent appeals to the court of appeals were rejected. In February 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency (the Competition Committees successor) seized approximately KZT 783 million ($5 million) from a frozen Nurenergoservice bank account in partial satisfaction of Nurenergoservices alleged damages liability. However, on appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court, in October 2009, the Supreme Court annulled the decisions of the lower courts because of procedural irregularities and remanded the case to the economic court for reconsideration. On remand, in January 2010, the economic court reaffirmed its April 2008 Decision. Nurenergoservices appeals in the court of appeals (first panel) and the court of appeals (second panel) were unsuccessful. Nurenergoservice intends to file a further appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court. In separate but related proceedings, in August 2007, the Competition Committee ordered Nurenergoservice to pay approximately KZT 1.8 billion ($12 million) in administrative fines for its alleged antimonopoly violations. Nurenergoservices appeal to the administrative court was rejected in February 2009. Given the adverse court decisions against Nurenergoservice, the Antimonopoly Agency may attempt to seize Nurenergoservices remaining assets, which are immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Antimonopoly Agency has not indicated whether it intends to assert claims against Nurenergoservice for alleged antimonopoly violations post first quarter 2007. Nurenergoservice believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it; however, there can be no assurances that it will prevail in these proceedings. In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of the power sales of Ust Kamenogorsk HPP (UK HPP) and Shulbinsk HPP, hydroelectric plants under AES concession (collectively, the Hydros), in January through February 2009. The investigation of Shulbinsk HPP is ongoing, but the investigation of UK HPP has been completed. The Antimonopoly Agency determined that UK HPP abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power in January through February 2009. The Agency sought an order from the administrative court requiring UK HPP to pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 120 million ($1 million) and to disgorge profits for the period at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately KZT 440 million ($3 million). No fines or damages have been paid to date, however, as the proceedings in the administrative court have been suspended due to the initiation of related criminal proceedings against officials of UK HPP. The Hydros believe they have meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. 102 Table of Contents In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of Ust Kamenogorsk TETS LLPs (UKT) power sales in 2008 through February 2009. The Antimonopoly Agency subsequently concluded that UKT abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power and should pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 136 million ($1 million). The Antimonopoly Agency later sought an order from the administrative court requiring UKT to pay the fine. The administrative court proceedings have been suspended due to a related criminal investigation of UKT employees. If the investigation is terminated and the Antimonopoly Agency prevails in the administrative proceedings, UKT may be ordered to pay the administrative fine and disgorge the profits from the sales at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately 514 million KZT ($3 million). UKT believes it has meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In December 2007, an arbitral tribunal terminated ESSAs gas supply contracts with members of the Sierra Chata Consortium in light of the restrictions that had been placed on the export of gas by the Argentine Republic. ESSA thereafter terminated its gas transportation contract with Transportadora de Gas del Norte S.A. (TGN), and initiated arbitration seeking relief from the obligation to pay the firm tariff under ESSAs gas transportation contracts with Gasoducto GasAndes (Argentina) S.A. (GasAndes Argentina) and Gasoducto GasAndes S.A. (GasAndes Chile) or in the alternative, termination of such contracts. TGN (which later filed a lawsuit against ESSA in Argentina), GasAndes Argentina, and GasAndes Chile disputed that the restrictions on the export of gas justified the adjustment or termination of the respective gas transportation contracts and sought due tariff payments. On December 29, 2010, ESSA reached settlement agreements with GasAndes Argentina, GasAndes Chile, and TGN terminating the respective gas transportation contracts and resolving all pending legal disputes and potential future claims. ESSA recognized approximately $72 million as other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2010 related to the settlement agreements. Upon termination of the TGN gas transportation contract, ESSA is no longer required to pay certain charges imposed by the Argentine Republic relating to gas supply infrastructure. In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina, Alaska, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, claiming that the defendants alleged GHG emissions have contributed to alleged global warming which, in turn, allegedly has led to the erosion of the plaintiffs alleged land. The plaintiffs assert nuisance and concert of action claims against the Company and the other defendants, and a conspiracy claim against a subset of the other defendants. The plaintiffs seek to recover relocation costs, indicated in the complaint to be from $95 million to $400 million, and other unspecified damages from the defendants. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the District Court granted in October 2009. The plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The parties have briefed the appeal and are awaiting a date for oral argument. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July, 1993 the Public Attorneys office filed a claim against Eletropaulo, the Sao Paulo State Government, SABESP (a state owned company), CETESB (a state owned company) and DAEE (the municipal Water and Electric Energy Department) alleging that they were liable for pollution of the Billings Reservoir as a result of pumping water from the Pinheiros River into the Billings Reservoir. The events in question occurred while Eletropaulo was a state owned company. An initial lower court decision in 2007 found the parties liable for the payment of approximately R$670 million ($401 million) for remediation. Eletropaulo subsequently appealed the decision to the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo which reversed the lower court decision. In 2009, the Public Attorneys Office has filed appeals to both Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) and the Supreme Court (SC) and such appeals were answered by Eletropaulo in the fourth quarter of 2009. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 1996, a public civil action was asserted against Eletropaulo and Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Desportiva Cultural Eletropaulo (the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o) relating to alleged environmental damage caused by construction of the 103 Table of Contents Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o near Guarapiranga Reservoir. The initial decision that was upheld by the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo in 2006 found that Eletropaulo should repair the alleged environmental damage by demolishing certain construction and reforesting the area, and either sponsor an environmental project which would cost approximately R$1 million ($599 thousand) as of December 31, 2010, or pay an indemnification amount of approximately R$10.2 million ($6 million). Eletropaulo has appealed this decision to the Supreme Court and is awaiting a decision. In February 2009, a CAA Section 114 information request from the EPA regarding Cayuga and Somerset was received. The request seeks various operating and testing data and other information regarding certain types of projects at the Cayuga and Somerset facilities, generally for the time period from January 1, 2000 through the date of the information request. This type of information request has been used in the past to assist the EPA in determining whether a plant is in compliance with applicable standards under the CAA. Cayuga and Somerset responded to the EPAs information request in June 2009, and they are awaiting a response from the EPA regarding their submittal. At this time, it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this request may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position. On February 2, 2009, the Cayuga facility received a Notice of Violation from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) that the facility had exceeded the permitted volume limit of coal ash that can be disposed of in the on site landfill. Cayuga has met with NYSDEC and submitted a Landfill Liner Demonstration Report to them. Such report found that the landfill has adequate engineering integrity to support the additional coal ash and there is no inherent environmental threat. NYSDEC has indicated they accept the finding of the report. A permit modification was approved by the NYSDEC on May 14, 2010 and such permit modification allows for closure of this approximately 10 acre portion of the landfill. The construction in accordance with the approved permit modification was completed in November 2010 and the certification report for this construction project is currently being drafted to submit to the NYSDEC in the second quarter of 2011. While at this time it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this matter may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position, based upon the discussions to date, the Company does not believe the impact will be material. In March 2009, AES Uruguaiana Empreendimentos S.A. (AESU) initiated arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against YPF S.A. (YPF) seeking damages and other relief relating to YPFs breach of the parties gas supply agreement (GSA). Thereafter, in April 2009, YPF initiated arbitration in the ICC against AESU and two unrelated parties, Companhia de Gas do Esado do Rio Grande do Sul and Transportador de Gas del Mercosur S.A. (TGM), claiming that AESU wrongfully terminated the GSA and caused the termination of a transportation agreement (TA) between YPF and TGM (YPF Arbitration). YPF seeks an unspecified amount of damages from AESU, a declaration that YPFs performance was excused under the GSA due to certain alleged force majeure events, or, in the alternative, a declaration that the GSA and the TA should be terminated without a finding of liability against YPF because of the allegedly onerous obligations imposed on YPF by those agreements. In addition, in the YPF Arbitration, TGM asserts that if it is determined that AESU is responsible for the termination of the GSA, AESU is liable for TGMs alleged losses, including losses under the TA. The procedural schedules for the arbitrations have been established but the hearing dates have not been scheduled to date. AESU believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit 104 Table of Contents was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. In June 2009, the Inter American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States (IACHR) requested that the Republic of Panama suspend the construction of AES Changuinola S.A.s hydroelectric project (Project) until the bodies of the Inter American human rights system can issue a final decision on a petition (286/08) claiming that the construction violates the human rights of alleged indigenous communities. In July 2009, Panama responded by informing the IACHR that it would not suspend construction of the Project and requesting that the IACHR revoke its request. In June 2010, the Inter American Court of Human Rights vacated the IACHRs request. With respect to the merits of the underlying petition, the IACHR heard arguments by the communities and Panama in November 2009, but has not issued a decision to date. The Company cannot predict Panamas response to any determination on the merits of the petition by the bodies of the Inter American human rights system. In July 2009, AES Energ&iacute;a Cartagena S.R.L. (AES Cartagena) received notices from the Spanish national energy regulator, Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de Energ&iacute;a (CNE), stating that the proceeds of the sale of electricity from AES Cartagenas plant should be reduced by roughly the value of the CO2 allowances that were granted to AES Cartagena for free for the years 2007, 2008, and the first half of 2009. In particular, the notices stated that CNE intended to invoice AES Cartagena to recover that value, which CNE calculated as approximately 20 million ($27 million) for 2007 2008 and an amount to be determined for the first half of 2009. In September 2009, AES Cartagena received invoices for 523,548 (approximately $694,000) for the allowances granted for free for 2007 and 19,907,248 (approximately $26 million) for 2008. In July 2010, AES Cartagena received an invoice for approximately 5.4 million ($7 million) for the allowances granted for free for the first half of 2009. AES Cartagena does not expect to be charged for CO2 allowances issued free of charge for subsequent periods. AES Cartagena has paid the amounts invoiced and has filed challenges to the CNEs demands in the Spanish judicial system. There can be no assurances that the challenges will be successful. AES Cartagena has demanded indemnification from its fuel supply and electricity toller, GDF Suez, in relation to the CNE invoices under the long term energy agreement (the Energy Agreement) with GDF Suez. However, GDF Suez has disputed that it is responsible for the CNE invoices under the Energy Agreement. Therefore, in September 2009, AES Cartagena initiated arbitration against GDF Suez, seeking to recover the payments made to CNE. In the arbitration, AES Cartagena also seeks a determination that GDF Suez is responsible for procuring and bearing the cost of CO2 allowances that are required to offset the CO2 emissions of AES Cartagenas power plant, which is also in dispute between the parties. To date, AES Cartagena has paid approximately 20 million ($27 million) for the CO2 allowances that have been required to offset 2008 and 2009 CO2 emissions. AES Cartagena expects that allowances will need to be purchased to offset emissions for subsequent years. The evidentiary hearing in the arbitration took place from May 31 June 4, 2010, and closing arguments were heard on September 1, 2010. In February 2011, the arbitral tribunal requested further briefing from the parties on certain issues in the arbitration. If AES Cartagena does not prevail in the arbitration and is required to bear the cost of carbon compliance, its results of operations could be materially adversely affected and, in turn, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company and its results of operations. AES Cartagena believes it has meritorious claims and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 2009, the Public Defenders Office of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (PDO) filed a class action against AES Sul in the 16th District Court of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (District Court), claiming that AES Sul has been illegally passing PIS and COFINS taxes (taxes based on AES Suls income) to consumers. According to ANEELs Order No. 93/05, the federal laws of Brazil, and the Brazilian Constitution, energy companies such as AES Sul are entitled to highlight PIS and COFINS taxes in power bills to final consumers, as the cost of those taxes is included in the energy tariffs that are applicable to final consumers. Before AES Sul had 105 Table of Contents been served with the action, the District Court dismissed the lawsuit in October 2009 on the ground that AES Sul had been properly highlighting PIS and COFINS taxes in consumer bills in accordance with Brazilian law. In April 2010, the PDO appealed to the Appellate Court of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (AC). In November 2010, the AC affirmed the dismissal. The PDO is expected to appeal. If the dismissal is ever reversed and AES Sul does not prevail in the lawsuit and is ordered to cease recovering PIS and COFINS taxes pursuant to its energy tariff, its potential prospective losses could be approximately R$9.6 million ($6 million) per month, as estimated by AES Sul. In addition, if AES Sul is ordered to reimburse consumers, its potential retrospective liability could be approximately R$1.2 billion ($718 million), as estimated by AES Sul. AES Sul believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings if it is served with the action; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in its efforts. Furthermore, if AES Sul does not prevail in the litigation it will seek to adjust its energy tariff to compensate it for its losses, but there can be no assurances that it would be successful in obtaining an adjusted energy tariff. In October 2009, IPL received a Notice of Violation (NOV) and Finding of Violation from EPA pursuant to CAA Section 113(a). The NOV alleges violations of the CAA at IPLs three coal fired electric generating facilities dating back to 1986. The alleged violations primarily pertain to EPAs Prevention of Significant Deterioration and nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) requirements under the CAA. Since receiving the letter, IPL management has met with EPA staff and is currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of similar cases have required companies to pay civil penalties and to install additional pollution control technology on coal fired electric generating units. A similar outcome in this case could have a material impact to IPL and could, in turn, have a material impact on the Company. IPL would seek recovery through customer rates of any operating or capital expenditures related to pollution control technology systems to reduce regulated air emissions; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in that regard. In November 2009, April 2010 and December 2010, substantially similar personal injury lawsuits were filed by a total of 26 residents and estates in the Dominican Republic against the Company, AES Atlantis, Inc., AES Puerto Rico, LP, AES Puerto Rico, Inc., and AES Puerto Rico Services, Inc., in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware. In each lawsuit the plaintiffs allege that the coal combustion byproducts of AES Puerto Ricos power plant were illegally placed in the Dominican Republic in October 2003 through March 2004 and subsequently caused the plaintiffs birth defects, other personal injuries, and or deaths. The plaintiffs do not quantify their alleged damages, but generally allege that they are entitled to compensatory and punitive damages. The AES defendants have moved for partial dismissal of both the November 2009 and April 2010 lawsuits on various grounds. (The AES Defendants have until mid February to respond to the December 2010 lawsuit.) In September 2010, the Superior Court heard arguments on the motions. The Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs fraud allegations without prejudice to replead, and the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in November 2010. The AES defendants have filed a renewed motion to dismiss the amended issues. The remaining claims (other than fraud) addressed in the AES defendants original motion to dismiss are still pending. The AES defendants believe they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. On December 21, 2010, AES 3C Maritza East 1 EOOD, which owns an unfinished 670MW lignite fired power plant in Bulgaria, made the first in a series of demands on the performance bond securing the construction Contractors obligations under the parties EPC Contract. The Contractor failed to complete the plant on schedule. The total amount demanded by Maritza under the performance bond is approximately 155 million ($205 million). However, the Contractor obtained a temporary injunction from a French court preventing the issuing bank from honoring the bond demands. As the performance bond is governed by English law, Maritza obtained a judgment from an English court that the bond should be paid, and then presented this judgment to the French court which issued the temporary injunction. However, on February 10, 2011, the French court issued a decision enjoining the issuing bank from honoring the demands on the performance bond pending the determination of the arbitration between Maritza and the Contractor, described below. Maritza is attempting to 106 Table of Contents lift that injunction or otherwise obtain payment on its demands. In addition, in December 2010, the Contractor issued a notice of dispute alleging that the lignite that has been supplied by Maritza for commissioning of the power plant is out of specification, allegedly entitling the Contractor to an extension of time to complete the power plant, an increase to the contract price of approximately 62 million ($82 million), and other relief. The Contractor thereafter advised Maritza that it had stopped commissioning of the power plants two units because of the characteristics of the lignite supplied, and, in January 2011, initiated arbitration on its lignite claim. Maritza disputes that the lignite is out of specification and intends to defend the arbitration and assert counterclaims for delay liquidated damages and other relief relating to the Contractors failure to complete the power plant and other breaches of the EPC contract. Maritza believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. ITEM 4. REMOVED AND RESERVED 107 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On March 12, 2010, the Company and Terrific Investment Corporation (Investor), a wholly owned subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, entered into a stockholder agreement (the Stockholder Agreement) in connection with the agreement discussed in the following paragraph. Under the Stockholder Agreement, as long as Investor holds more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, Investor will have the right to designate one nominee, who must be reasonably acceptable to the Board, for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. Investor has not designated its nominee for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, until such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock, Investor has agreed to vote its shares in accordance with the recommendation of the Company on any matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company relating to the election of directors and compensation matters. Otherwise, Investor may vote its shares at its discretion. Further, under the Stockholder Agreement, Investor will be subject to a standstill restriction which generally prohibits Investor from purchasing additional securities of the Company beyond the level acquired by it under the stock purchase agreement entered into between Investor and the Company on November 6, 2009. In addition, Investor has agreed to a lock up restriction such that Investor would not sell its shares for a period of 12 months following the closing, subject to certain exceptions. The standstill and lock up restrictions also terminate at such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock. Investor will have certain registration rights and preemptive rights under the Stockholder Agreement with respect to its shares of common stock of the Company. On March 15, 2010, the Company completed the sale of 125,468,788 shares of common stock to Investor. The shares were sold for $12.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.58 billion. Investors ownership in the Companys common stock is now approximately 15% of the Companys total outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers In July 2010, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $500 million of AES common stock. The Board authorization permits the Company to repurchase stock through a variety of methods, including open market repurchases and or privately negotiated transactions. The original authorization was set to expire on December 31, 2010, however; in December 2010, the Board authorized an extension of the stock repurchase program. There can be no assurance as to the amount, timing or prices of repurchases, which may vary based on market conditions and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2010, shares of common stock repurchased under this plan totaled 8,382,825 at a total cost of $99 million plus a nominal amount of commissions (average of $11.86 per share including commissions). There was $401 million remaining under the stock repurchase program available for future repurchases at December 31, 2010. 108 Table of Contents The following table presents information regarding purchases made by The AES Corporation of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2010: Repurchase Period Total Numberof SharesPurchased Average PricePaid per Share Total Number of SharesRepurchased as Partof a Publicly AnnouncedRepurchase Plan Dollar Value of MaximumNumber of Shares To BePurchased Under the Plan 10/1/10 10/31/10 6,086,345 $ 12.30 6,086,345 $ 409,713,649 11/1/10 11/30/10 $ $ 409,713,649 12/1/10 12/31/10 755,000 $ 11.89 755,000 $ 400,732,931 Total 6,841,345 $ 12.26 6,841,345 Market Information Our common stock is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol AES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business We are a global power company. We operate two primary lines of business. The first is our Generation business, where we own and or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities, other intermediaries and certain end users. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our Generation and Utilities businesses comprised approximately 45% and 55% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We are also continuing to expand our wind and solar generation businesses. These initiatives are not material contributors to our operating results at this time, but we believe that certain of these initiatives may become material in the future. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10 K. Our Organization and Segments. Our management reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively EMEA), each managed by a regional president. The financial reporting segment structure uses our management reporting structure as its foundation and reflects how we manage the business internally. Based on our application of the segment reporting accounting guidance, which provides certain quantitative thresholds and aggregation criteria, we have concluded that the Company has the following six reportable segments: Latin America Generation; Latin America Utilities; North America Generation; North America Utilities; Europe Generation; Asia Generation. We report the Companys Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation, Wind Generation and Climate Solutions operating segments within Corporate and Other because they do not meet the criteria to allow for aggregation with another operating segment or the quantitative thresholds that would require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. None of these operating segments are currently material to our financial statement presentation of reportable segments, individually or in the aggregate. Corporate and Other also includes corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments and other intercompany charges such as self insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company modified its internal reporting structure to move the management of the Companys generation business in Jordan, Amman East, from Asia to Europe. Accordingly, Amman East is now reported within the Europe Generation segment. All prior periods have been retrospectively restated to reflect this change and conform to current period presentation. Key Drivers of Our Results of Operations. Our Generation and Utilities businesses are distinguished by the nature of their customers, operational differences, cost structure, regulatory environment and risk exposure. As a result, each line of business has slightly different drivers which affect operating results. Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other things, plant reliability and efficiency, power prices, volume, 113 Table of Contents management of fixed and variable operating costs, management of working capital including collection of receivables, and the extent to which our plants have hedged their exposure to currency and commodities such as fuel. For our Generation businesses which sell power under short term contracts or in the spot market, the most crucial factors are the current market price of electricity and the marginal costs of production. Growth in our Generation business is largely tied to securing new PPAs, expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building or acquiring new power plants. Performance drivers for our Utilities businesses include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; management of working capital, including collection of receivables; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive regulatory requirements; and in developing countries, reduction of commercial and technical losses. The operating results of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth and weather conditions in areas in which they operate. In addition to these drivers, as further explained below, the Company also has exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. One of the key factors which affect our Generation business is our ability to enter into contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of fuel used to produce that electricity. Long term contracts are intended to reduce exposure to volatility associated with fuel prices in the market and the price of electricity by fixing the revenue and costs for these businesses. The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. In turn, most of these businesses enter into long term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. While these long term contractual agreements reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel, the predictability of operating results and cash flows vary by business based on the extent to which a facilitys generation capacity and fuel requirements are contracted and the negotiated terms of these agreements. Entering into these contracts exposes us to counterparty credit risk. For further discussion of these risks, see Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. When fuel costs increase, many of our businesses are able to pass these costs on to their customers. Generation businesses with long term contracts in place do this by including fuel pass through or fuel indexing arrangements in their contracts. Utilities businesses can pass costs on to their customers through increases in current or future tariff rates. Therefore, in a rising fuel cost environment, the increased fuel costs for these businesses often result in an increase in revenue to the extent these costs can be passed through (though not necessarily on a one for one basis). Conversely, in a declining fuel cost environment, the decreased fuel costs can result in a decrease in revenue. Increases or decreases in revenue at these businesses that have the ability to pass through costs to the customer have a corresponding impact on cost of sales, to the extent the costs can be passed through, resulting in a limited impact on gross margin, if any. Although these circumstances may not have a large impact on gross margin, they can significantly affect gross margin as a percentage of revenue. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of revenue is a less relevant measure when evaluating our operating performance. To the extent our businesses are unable to pass through fuel cost increases to their customers, gross margin may be adversely affected. Global diversification also helps us mitigate risk. Our presence in mature markets helps mitigate the exposure associated with our businesses in emerging markets. Additionally, our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, water (hydroelectric power), wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. However, to the extent the mix of fuel sources enabling our generation capabilities in any one market is not diversified, the spread in costs of different fuels or the availability of natural resources such as water for hydroelectric power production or wind may also influence the operating performance and the ability of our subsidiaries to compete within that market. For example, in a market where gas prices fall to a low level compared to coal prices, power prices may be set by low gas prices which can affect the profitability of our coal plants in that market. In certain cases, we may attempt to hedge fuel prices to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, we only hedge a 114 Table of Contents portion of our currency and commodity risks, and our businesses are still subject to these risks, as further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. Commodity and power price volatility could continue to impact our financial metrics to the extent this volatility is not hedged. For a discussion of our sensitivities to commodity, currency and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Form 10 K. Due to our global presence, the Company has significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure is primarily associated with the impact of the translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results from their local currency to U.S. Dollars that is required for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, there is foreign currency transaction exposure when an entity enters into transactions, including debt agreements, in currencies other than their functional currency. These risks are further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. During 2010, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a significant impact on our operating results. If the current foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues, our gross margin and other financial metrics could continue to be affected. Another key driver of our results is our ability to bring new businesses into commercial operation successfully. We currently have approximately 1,300 MW of projects under construction in eight countries. Our prospects for improved operating results and cash flows are dependent upon successful completion of these projects on time and within budget. However, as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties, construction is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with site identification, financing, permitting and our ability to meet construction deadlines. Delays or the inability to complete projects and commence commercial operations can result in increased costs, impairment of assets and other challenges involving partners and counterparties to our construction agreements, PPAs and other agreements. Our gross margin is also impacted by the fact that in each country in which we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity, and environmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business. Regulations differ on a country by country basis (and even at the state and local municipality levels) and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country, and affect many aspects of our operations and development projects. Our ability to negotiate tariffs, enter into long term contracts, pass through costs related to capital expenditures and otherwise navigate these regulations can have an impact on our revenue, costs and gross margin. Environmental and land use regulations, including existing and proposed regulation of GHG emissions, could substantially increase our capital expenditures or other compliance costs, which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. For a further discussion of the Regulatory Environment, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments Environmental, included in Item 8. Financial Statements, Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated with Government Regulation and Laws of this Form 10 K. Key Drivers of Results in 2010 In 2010, the Companys gross margin and cash flow from operations increased $531 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, while net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million compared to the prior year. During 2010, our North American generation businesses continued to face challenges associated with relatively lower gas prices and a decline in power prices relative to coal and other fuel. In particular, lower gas and power prices have affected the generation volume and financial results of our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas which are merchant businesses and not subject to PPAs. We expect 115 Table of Contents this trend to continue. In 2010, these challenges were partially mitigated by hedging arrangements. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Impairments below. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Despite these challenges, many of our financial measures have improved when compared to 2009. Gross margin increased due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation caused by a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies in 2010 and better operating performance at certain businesses. For instance, certain of the Companys Latin American businesses experienced continued increases in market demand due to the local economic recovery in Latin America. The Company also benefited from higher demand and favorable market conditions at Masinloc, our generation business in the Philippines. Masinlocs higher availability enabled the Company to benefit from increased contract and spot market sales and favorable market prices in the Philippines. In addition, cash provided by operating activities increased due to the improved operating results at Latin America generation businesses and Masinloc; contributions from the consolidation of Cartagena and the Ballylumford acquisition in 2010; and changes in working capital in Latin America. Despite the increase in gross margin in 2010, net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased primarily from the impact of long lived asset impairments recognized related to four businesses: Eastern Energy in New York, Southland in California, Tisza II in Hungary and Deepwater in Texas. These were partially offset by gains from the sale of our discontinued businesses in Oman and Qatar and a decrease in goodwill impairment charges. In 2011, we expect to face continued challenges in our business, including the trends in North America described above. In addition, the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and commodity prices on our operations may continue into 2011. In 2011, the components of the tariff reset in Brazil and its potential impact on our Brazilian utilities are uncertain at this time and we expect continued challenges in our merchant businesses such as those in the U.S., Hungary and Northern Ireland. However, management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses and growth from new businesses acquired, that commenced operations in 2010 or are expected to commence operations in 2011, may lessen or offset the impact of these challenges described above, as they did in 2010. However, if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described above or elsewhere in this section impact us more than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our gross margin and net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In addition, we do not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. Such cash flows may be influenced by the operating challenges presented above and will also not include the cash flows from operations which were sold in 2010 or the increases experienced from the cash flows provided by the initial consolidation of Cartagena, the acquisition of Ballylumford and several working capital transactions at our Latin American utilities in 2010 as discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity. The following briefly describes the key changes in our reported revenue, gross margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, Adjusted Earnings per Share (a non GAAP measure) and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Results of Operations and Segment Analysis discussion within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. 116 Table of Contents Performance Highlights Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 Gross Margin $ 3,964 $ 3,433 $ 3,568 Net Income Attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share from Continuing Operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (a non GAAP measure)(1) $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 3,510 $ 2,202 $ 2,160 (1) See reconciliation and definition below under Non GAAP Measure. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue increased $2.7 billion, or 19%, to $16.6 billion in 2010 compared with $14.0 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $805 million; increased volume and rates at our Brazilian utilities attributable to increased demand due to the recovery of the local economy and the favorable impact of the June 2009 tariff reset; the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010; the favorable impact of rates at our generation businesses in Argentina; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; higher demand at Gener in Chile; the impact of the Companys new business in Northern Ireland, acquired in August 2010; and higher demand and rates at Indianapolis Power and Light. Gross margin increased $531 million, or 15%, to $4.0 billion in 2010 compared with $3.4 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $219 million; an increase in demand at our generation and utilities businesses in Latin America; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; and the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs in Latin America, largely driven by bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil in 2009 that did not recur; and lower rates at our generation businesses in New York. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million to $9 million in 2010, compared to $658 million in 2009. Key drivers of the decrease included: Impairment losses in New York related to our Eastern Energy facilities, in California related to our Southland (Huntington Beach) generation facility, in Hungary related to our Tisza II generation facility and in Texas related to our Deepwater facility; 117 Table of Contents A decrease in gain on sale of investments due to the sale of our businesses in Northern Kazakhstan which occurred in 2009; and A decrease in other income due to the reduction in interest and penalties in 2009 associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the Programa de Recuperacao Fiscal (REFIS) program and a favorable court decision in 2009 enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by: The gain on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of Barka which occurred in August 2010; An increase in net equity in earnings of affiliates partially offset by income tax expense related to the sale of the Companys indirect investment in Companhia Energ&eacute;tica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Lower impairment expenses related to a goodwill impairment of our business in Kilroot that occurred in 2009; Lower income tax expense due to 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries; and An increase in gross margin as described above. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion, or 59%, to $3.5 billion in 2010 compared with $2.2 billion in 2009. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $837 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased tax payments in 2009 associated with a tax amnesty program of $326 million, higher working capital requirements during 2009 related to payments on the settlement of swap agreements of $65 million and in 2010, a $50 million decrease in employer contributions to pension plans and lower payments for contingencies; an increase of $215 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to the higher gross margin in 2010 combined with improved working capital mainly as a result of higher collections of value added taxes and accounts receivable; an increase of $99 million at Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher gross margin; and an increase of $58 million as a result of our consolidation of Cartagena in 2010 and the acquisition of Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $136 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations of businesses sold in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of businesses sold was $33 million and will not recur in 2011. In 2010 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities at our Latin American Utilities businesses included several items such as the tax amnesty program and settlement of swap agreements, as described above, that are not expected to recur. In addition, 2010 net cash provided by operating activities benefited from the one time cash savings related to the utilization of tax credits received as a result of the REFIS program. As such, the Company does not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. 118 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue decreased $1.2 billion, or 8%, to $14.0 billion in 2009 compared with $15.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $997 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; decreases in volume at Uruguaiana due to the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold, as well as in New York and Hungary and lower dispatch in Northern Ireland due to unfavorable gas prices compared to coal; the impact of lower spot and contract energy prices at our generation business in Chile; and lower energy prices and volume at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase in tariff rates at our utilities businesses in Latin America primarily reflecting the recovery of energy purchases that were passed through to our customers. Gross margin decreased $135 million, or 4%, to $3.4 billion in 2009 compared with $3.6 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $218 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; lower energy prices and higher purchased energy costs at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic and Argentina; increased pension costs in Brazil and the U.S.; and lower volume in New York due to lower spot market rates. These decreases were partially offset by: improved operating performance at our generation businesses in Chile and the Philippines; higher tariffs in Brazil and El Salvador; and bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $576 million to $658 million in 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: a gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Northern Kazakhstan partially offset by a performance incentive bonus recognized in 2009 for management services provided to these subsidiaries and a settlement upon termination of the management agreement in 2009; the reduction in gross margin in 2009 as described above; and higher impairment expenses in 2009 as a result of an impairment of goodwill at Kilroot in Northern Ireland, and an impairment recognized on our assets in Pakistan which is reflected in discontinued operations, offset by a decline in long lived asset impairment compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by: a reduction in foreign currency transaction losses on net monetary position as a result of reduced losses at our businesses in Chile and the Philippines; a reduction in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates and debt balances in Brazil and favorable foreign currency translation; and lower income tax expenses driven in part by lower pre tax income and a decrease in the effective tax rate from 29% in 2008 to 26% in 2009 due, in part, to tax benefits recorded in 2009 upon the release of 119 Table of Contents valuation allowances at U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recognized in Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. In 2008, the $905 million gain recognized on the sale of our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses had a significant impact on net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In 2009, the Company recognized a performance incentive bonus of $80 million in the first quarter for management services provided to these sold businesses, reflected as other income. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized an additional gain on the sale of the businesses of $98.5 million upon the termination of the management agreement. While the Company engages in the sale of assets and businesses from time to time, the gain or loss recognized in any such sale will depend on a number of factors related to the asset or business that may be sold. Therefore, the Company does not believe that the decline in net income between 2008 and 2009 represents a trend. All of the amounts related to our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses were reported in continuing operations and will not recur in 2010 or future years. Net cash from operating activities increased $42 million, or 2%, to $2.2 billion in 2009 compared with $2.2 billion in 2008. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $238 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to improved working capital management; an increase of $148 million at our Asia Generation businesses due to improved working capital management and improved gross margin; and an increase of $115 million at our Europe Generation businesses primarily due to the collection of the $80 million Kazakhstan management performance incentive bonus in the first quarter 2009. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $391 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased working capital requirements, including the payment of the settlement of a swap agreement, increased tax payments associated with a tax amnesty program and increased payments related to the settlement of contingencies and energy purchases, partially offset by increased operating results; and a decrease of $77 million at our North America Generation businesses, primarily due to reduced operating results. Non GAAP Measure We define adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) mark to market amounts related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) significant gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) significant losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. AES believes that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Companys internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to mark to market gains or losses related to derivative transactions, currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.11 per share. For purposes of measuring loss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be antidilutive. However, for purposes of computing Adjusted 120 Table of Contents EPS (a non GAAP measure), the Company has included the impact of dilutive common stock equivalents as the inclusion of the defined adjustments result in income for Adjusted EPS. The table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in GAAP diluted earnings per share to the weighted average shares used in calculating the non GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Reconciliation of Denominator used for Adjusted Earnings Per Share Loss Shares $ per Share GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Loss from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders $ (86 ) 769 $ (0.11 ) EFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES Stock options 2 Restricted stock units 3 NON GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE $ (86 ) 774 $ (0.11 ) Year Ended December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share 2010 2009 2008 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Derivative mark to market (gains) losses(1) (0.01 ) 0.02 0.05 Currency transaction (gains) losses(2) (0.04 ) (0.04 ) 0.17 Disposition/acquisition (gains) losses (3) (0.19 )(4) (1.27 )(5) Impairment losses 1.07 (6) 0.21 (7) 0.13 (8) Debt retirement (gains) losses 0.03 (9) 0.25 (10) Adjusted earnings per share $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 (1) Derivative mark to market (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (2) Unrealized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (3) The Company has not adjusted for the gain or the related tax effect from the sale of its indirect investment in CEMIG, disclosed in Note 7 Investments in and Advances to Affiliates, in its determination of Adjusted EPS because the gain was recognized by an equity method investee. The Company does not adjust for transactions of its equity method investees in its determination of adjusted EPS. (4) Amount includes: Kazakhstan gain of $98 million, or $0.15 per share, related to the termination of a management agreement as well as a gain of $13 million, or $0.02 per share, related to the reversal of a withholding tax contingency. In addition, there was a gain on sale associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China of $14 million, or $0.02 per share. There were no taxes associated with any of these transactions. (5) Amount includes: Net gain on Kazakhstan sale of $905 million, or $1.31 per share, and net loss on sale of subsidiary interests in Gener of $31 million, or $0.04 per share. There was no income tax impact associated with these transactions. (6) Amount primarily includes asset impairments at Eastern Energy of $827 million, Southland (Huntington Beach) of $200 million, Tisza of $85 million, and Deepwater of $79 million ($537 million, or $0.69 per share, $130 million, or $0.17 per share, $69 million, or $0.09 per share, and $51 million, or $0.07 per share, net of income tax, respectively) and goodwill impairment at Deepwater of $18 million (or $0.02 per share, with no income tax impact). (7) Amount includes: Goodwill impairments at Kilroot of $118 million, or $0.18 per share, and in the Ukraine of $4 million, or $0.01 per share; write off of development project costs in Latin America and Asia of $19 million ($11 million net of noncontrolling interests, or $0.01 per share) and an impairment of $10 million, or $0.01 per share, of the Companys investment in a company developing blue gas (coal to gas) technology. There was no income tax impact associated with any of these transactions. 121 Table of Contents (8) Amount includes: Impairment charges primarily associated with development projects in North America of $75 million ($34 million net of noncontrolling interests and income tax, or $0.06 per share); Uruguaiana asset write down of $36 million ($17 million net of noncontrolling interest, or $0.02 per share); South Africa peaker development cost write off of $31 million ($28 million net of income tax, or $0.04 per share) and a nontaxable impairment of the Companys investment in blue gas (coal to gas) technology of $10 million, or $0.01 per share. Impairment losses are net of an income tax benefit of $0.02 per share in 2008. (9) Amount includes loss on retirement of debt at the Parent Company of $15 million, at Andres of $10 million, and at Itabo of $8 million ($10 million, or $0.01 per share, net of income tax at the Parent Company, $0.01 per share at Andres, and $4 million, or $0.01 per share, net of noncontrolling interest at Itabo). (10) Amount includes: $55 million ($34 million net of income tax, or $0.05 per share) loss on the retirement of Parent Company debt; $131 million, or $0.19 per share, which represented the tax impact on the repatriation of a portion of the Kazakhstan sale proceeds that were used to fund the early retirement of Parent Company debt; and $14 million ($9 million net of income tax, or $0.01 per share) of debt refinancing at IPALCO. Debt retirement (gains) losses are net of an income tax benefit of $0.04 per share in 2008. Managements Priorities Management continues to focus on the following priorities: Execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy including funds received in 2010 from asset and equity sales: investing in value accretive projects; delevering to increase financial flexibility, reduce risk and to create future borrowing capacity; and executing its stock repurchase program; from July through December 2010 we have repurchased a total of $99 million, or approximately 8.4 million shares of AES common stock, at an average price per share of $11.86, including commissions. Improvement of operations in the existing portfolio; Achieve cost savings through the alignment of overhead costs with business requirements, systems automation and optimal allocation of business development spending; Strategic portfolio management of existing projects including restructuring and potential sales of certain North American generation subsidiaries; Completion of an approximately 1,300 MW active construction program on time and within budget; Achieving commercial operation at Maritza in Bulgaria. At the end of 2010, the Company experienced certain commissioning delays, as further described in Key Trends and Uncertainties Development below; and 122 Table of Contents Integration of new projects. During 2010, the following projects were acquired or commenced commercial operations: Project Location Fuel GrossMW AES Equity Interest(Percent, Rounded) Ballylumford United Kingdom Gas 1,246 100 % JHRH(1) China Hydro 379 35 % Nueva Ventanas Chile Coal 272 71 % St. Nikola Bulgaria Wind 156 89 % Guacolda 4(2) Chile Coal 152 35 % Dong Qi(3) China Wind 49 49 % Huanghua II(3) China Wind 49 49 % St. Patrick France Wind 35 100 % North Rhins Scotland Wind 22 100 % Kepezkaya Turkey Hydro 28 51 % Damlapinar(4) Turkey Hydro 16 51 % (1) Jianghe Rural Electrification Development Co.

Acquisition of 35% ownership was completed in June 2010 and the transfer of the remaining 14% ownership, which is subject to approval by the Chinese government, is expected to be completed in May 2011. (2) Guacolda is an equity method investment indirectly held by AES through Gener. The AES equity interest reflects the 29% noncontrolling interests in Gener. (3) Joint venture with Guohua Energy Investment Co. Ltd. (4) Joint Venture with I.C. Energy. Key Trends and Uncertainties Our operations continue to face many risks as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Some of these challenges are also described above in Key Drivers of Results in 2010. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. Development. During the past year, the Company has successfully acquired and completed construction of a number of projects, totaling approximately 2,404 MW, including the acquisition of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom and completion of construction of a number of projects in Europe, Chile and China. However, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties of this Form 10 K, our development projects are subject to uncertainties. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not yet begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, we believe that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this time frame. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results or financial position. Global Economic Conditions. During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Although the economic conditions in several of these countries have improved in recent months, our businesses could be impacted in the event these recent trends do not continue. 123 Table of Contents Our business or results of operations could be impacted if our subsidiaries are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all, are unable to raise funds through the sale of assets or are otherwise unable to finance or refinance their activities. The Company could also be adversely affected if capital market disruptions result in increased borrowing costs (including with respect to interest payments on the Companys or our subsidiaries variable rate debt) or if commodity prices affect the profitability of our plants or their ability to continue operations. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if general economic or political conditions in the markets where our subsidiaries operate deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the availability and or an increase in the cost of capital, or if the value of our assets remain depressed or decline further. Any of the foregoing events or a combination thereof could have a material impact on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, financial covenants, and or its credit rating. Our subsidiaries are subject to credit risk, which includes risk related to the ability of counterparties (such as parties to our PPAs, fuel supply agreements, hedging agreements and other contractual arrangements) to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price or to satisfy their financial or other contractual obligations. The Company has not suffered any material effects related to its counterparties during 2010. However, if macroeconomic conditions impact our counterparties, they may be unable to meet their commitments which could result in the loss of favorable contractual positions, which could have a material impact on our business. In addition, during the past year, certain European countries have faced a sovereign debt crisis and it is possible that other nations could be affected. This crisis has resulted in an increased risk of default by governments and the implementation of austerity measures in countries. If the crisis continues, worsens, or spreads, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company. Our businesses may be impacted if they are unable to access the capital markets, face increased taxes or labor costs, or if governments fail to fulfill their obligations to us or adopt austerity measures which adversely impact our projects. In addition, as noted in the Risk Factor entitled, Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges, our renewables businesses are dependent on favorable regulatory incentives, including subsidies, which are provided by sovereign governments. If these subsidies or other incentives are reduced or repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, in whole or in part, this could impact the ability of the affected businesses to continue to grow their operations. For example, the Spanish government recently issued a decree which limits the feed in tariff and number of photovoltaic hours eligible for the tariff, which could adversely impact AES Solar in Spain. For further information on the decree see Item 1. Regulatory Spain of this Form 10 K. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries. For further information on the importance of long term contracts and our counterparty credit risk, see the Risk Factor from this Form 10 K titled, We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. As a result of any of the foregoing events, we may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. The Companys investment in AES Solar, whose primary operations are in Europe, at December 31, 2010 was $312 million. For a discussion of the risks associated with commodity prices, see We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. It is also possible that commodity or power price volatility could continue to impact our financial results. As noted in Key Drivers of Results in 2010, and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk of this Form 10 K, the Companys North American businesses continue to face pressure as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place, but purchase 124 Table of Contents fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. If these conditions continue or worsen, these businesses may need to restructure their obligations or seek additional funding (including from the Parent) or face the possibility that they may be unable to meet their obligations and continue operations. Presently, Eastern Energy, Deepwater and Thames are seeking to restructure their financial obligations and or place certain of their plants in protective layup status to mitigate operating risks caused by high fuel costs and other competitive pressures. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. The Company presently manages its commodity risk with hedging activities to mitigate earnings volatility. However, at present in North America, dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present an opportunity to engage in additional hedging activity for 2011. As a result, there are hedging arrangements in place for only a relatively small portion of 2011. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. Specifically, the operating results of the Companys Eastern Energy generation business in New York could be adversely impacted by continued higher coal prices relative to electricity prices if hedging continues to be uneconomic. If global economic conditions worsen, it could also affect the rates we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our rates based on prevailing market conditions as PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual rate or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. Impairments. Long lived assets. The global economic conditions and other adverse factors discussed above heighten the risk of a significant asset impairment. Examples of conditions that could be indicative of impairment which would require us to evaluate the recovery of a long lived asset or asset group include: current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset group; a significant adverse change in legal factors, including changes in environmental or other regulations or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used or in its physical condition. As further described in Item 1. Regulatory Matters United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR) had the right to require the termination of the long term PPAs under which Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom, supplies electricity to NIE Energy as early as 2010. One of the conditions to the early termination was 180 days notice, which was provided to Kilroot on April 30, 2010. At March 31, 2010, management evaluated Kilroots long lived assets for potential impairment assuming the early termination of the PPA and concluded that no impairment existed at that time. On October 28, 2010, Kilroot received final notice from NIAUR directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the PPA effective November 1, 2010. Kilroot may not be able to replace the contract on competitive terms and, upon cancellation of the PPA effective November 1, 2010, became a merchant plant. It will operate under the gross mandatory pool of the SEM in Northern Ireland. There have been no additional impairment indicators since March 31, 2010. AES Eastern Energy (AEE) operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. 125 Table of Contents The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated an impairment evaluation of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW petroleum coke (pet coke) fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and a recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 126 Table of Contents 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time, since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and what form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations. This was considered as an impairment indicator for the long lived asset groups. The recoverability test of the long lived asset groups indicated that the carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group exceeded its fair value by $200 million which was recognized as an impairment expense. The carrying amounts of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach long lived asset groups were determined to be recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis at September 30, 2010 and no impairment was necessary. During the third quarter of 2010, we also recognized impairment on the long lived assets at our Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. Tisza II operates under an annual contract with an off taker. In the third quarter of 2010, when Tisza II began the negotiation of its 2011 contract, future undiscounted cash flows of the plant were no longer expected to recover the long lived assets groups carrying amount due to prevailing market rates, higher generation costs and lower demand expectations. Accordingly, the Company measured the fair value of the long lived asset group and recorded an impairment expense of $85 million, representing the excess of carrying amount over the fair value at September 30, 2010. Goodwill. The Company seeks business acquisitions as one of its growth strategies. We have achieved significant growth in the past as a result of several business acquisitions, which also resulted in the recognition of goodwill. As noted in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, there is always a risk that Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. The benefits of goodwill are typically realized through the future operating results of an acquired business. Management believes that the recoverability of goodwill is positively correlated with the economic environments in which our acquired businesses operate and a severe economic downturn could negatively impact the recoverability of goodwill. Also, the evolving environmental regulations, including GHG regulations, around the globe continue to increase the operating costs of our generation businesses. In extreme situations, the environmental regulations could even make a once profitable business uneconomical. In addition, most of our generation businesses have a finite life and as the acquired businesses reach the end of their finite lives, the carrying amount of goodwill is gradually recovered through their periodic operating results. The accounting guidance, however, prohibits the systematic amortization of goodwill and rather requires an annual impairment evaluation. Thus, as some of our acquired businesses approach the end of their finite lives, they may incur goodwill impairment charges even if there are no discrete adverse changes in the economic environment. As noted in Long lived assets above, adverse market conditions at Deepwater were also considered an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. Accordingly, in the second and third quarters of 2010, interim 127 Table of Contents goodwill impairment evaluations were performed at the Deepwater reporting unit level. The reporting unit passed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation in the second quarter and no impairment was recognized. In the third quarter, however, the reporting unit failed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation. Upon measurement of impairment loss in Step 2, the entire $18 million goodwill balance was considered impaired and recognized as goodwill impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation and did not have any reporting units that were considered at risk. A reporting unit is considered at risk when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. While there were no potential impairment indicators that could result in the recognition of goodwill impairment for any of these reporting units, it is possible we may incur goodwill impairment on these reporting units in future years if any of the following events occur: a significant adverse change in business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a sale of assets at less than carrying amount, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, an acquisition not performing as expected, changing environmental regulations that significantly increase the cost of doing business, or a business reaches the end of its finite life. The likelihood of the occurrence of these events may increase because of the challenging global macroeconomic conditions. Regulatory Environment. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter and mercury. For a description of material regulations faced by the Company, see Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies and Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows set forth in this Form 10 K. Recent Events Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company continued to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program announced on July 7, 2010. The Company has repurchased 1,026,610 shares at a cost of $13 million in 2011, bringing the cumulative total through February 22, 2010 to 9,409,435 shares at a total cost of $112 million (average price of $11.92 per share including commissions). As of February 25, 2011, $388 million of the $500 million authorized remained available under the stock repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 14 Equity. On February 1, 2011, AES Thames, LLC (Thames), our 208 MW coal fired plant in Connecticut, filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy is due, in part, to the increased cost of energy production. The bankruptcy protection is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or the results of operations. 128 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, Results of operations 2010 2009 2008 $ change2010 vs. 2009 $ change2009 vs. 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: Latin America Generation $ 4,281 $ 3,651 $ 4,468 $ 630 $ (817 ) Latin America Utilities 7,222 6,092 5,907 1,130 185 North America Generation 1,972 1,940 2,234 32 (294 ) North America Utilities 1,145 1,068 1,079 77 (11 ) Europe Generation 1,362 820 1,143 542 (323 ) Asia Generation 618 375 345 243 30 Corporate and Other(1) 1,066 870 1,012 196 (142 ) Eliminations(2) (1,019 ) (862 ) (991 ) (157 ) 129 Total Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 $ 2,693 $ (1,243 ) Gross Margin: Latin America Generation $ 1,497 $ 1,357 $ 1,398 $ 140 $ (41 ) Latin America Utilities 1,072 918 886 154 32 North America Generation 435 477 660 (42 ) (183 ) North America Utilities 249 239 261 10 (22 ) Europe Generation 268 212 273 56 (61 ) Asia Generation 240 93 (10 ) 147 103 Corporate and Other(3) 186 117 62 69 55 Eliminations(4) 17 20 38 (3 ) (18 ) General and administrative expenses (392 ) (339 ) (368 ) (53 ) 29 Interest expense (1,526 ) (1,485 ) (1,770 ) (41 ) 285 Interest income 411 348 519 63 (171 ) Other expense (239 ) (111 ) (161 ) (128 ) 50 Other income 108 465 375 (357 ) 90 Gain on sale of investments 131 909 (131 ) (778 ) Loss on sale of subsidiary stock (31 ) 31 Goodwill impairment (21 ) (122 ) 101 (122 ) Asset impairment expense (1,221 ) (25 ) (175 ) (1,196 ) 150 Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position (33 ) 33 (184 ) (66 ) 217 Other non operating expense (7 ) (12 ) (15 ) 5 3 Income tax expense (307 ) (599 ) (771 ) 292 172 Net equity in earnings of affiliates 183 92 33 91 59 Income from continuing operations 920 1,809 1,929 (889 ) (120 ) Income from operations of discontinued businesses 75 96 97 (21 ) (1 ) Gain (loss) from disposal of discontinued businesses 64 (150 ) 6 214 (156 ) Net income 1,059 1,755 2,032 (696 ) (277 ) Noncontrolling interests: Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,006 ) (1,099 ) (759 ) 93 (340 ) (Income) loss from discontinuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (44 ) 2 (39 ) (46 ) 41 Net income attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 $ (649 ) $ (576 ) Per Share Data: Basic income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.75 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.69 ) Diluted income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.67 ) (1) Corporate and Other includes revenue from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, Wind Generation and other renewables initiatives.

These increases were partially offset by: lower volume sold at Uruguaiana of $53 million as a result of renegotiation of its power sales agreements; lower volume due to unfavorable hydrology in Colombia and Argentina of $41 million; lower contract prices at Gener of $32 million; and lower contract prices on PPAs indexed to international coal prices in the Dominican Republic of $22 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $106 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $34 million, or 3%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher spot prices in Argentina of $69 million; higher volume and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic of $55 million; higher contract prices of $33 million in Colombia; the positive impact of $28 million resulting from the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana, as mentioned above; and higher volume of $23 million in Panama. These increases were partially offset by: higher fuel and purchased energy prices at Gener of $48 million; the net effect of lower PPA prices and higher fuel costs in the Dominican Republic of $38 million; 130 Table of Contents the impact of a reversal of bad debt expense during the first quarter of 2009 of $36 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of one of its power sales agreements; and higher fixed costs of $30 million at Gener primarily due to higher employee costs, increased maintenance expenses and costs incurred due to construction delays at Campiche. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 17% while gross margin increased 10%, primarily due to higher spot purchases and fuel prices at Gener and the reversal of bad debt expense as a result of the renegotiation of one of the power sales agreements at Uruguaiana in the first quarter of 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $181 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $636 million, or 14%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower spot and contract prices of $295 million at Gener; lower volume of $227 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold; and lower energy prices and volume of $174 million in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: and increase of $100 million due to fewer outages at Gener and in Argentina in 2009; and higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $94 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $53 million, or 4%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;; fewer outages of $60 million at Gener and in Argentina; lower diesel consumption, partially offset by higher energy purchases and higher gas consumption, at Gener of $47 million; lower volume of energy purchased at Uruguaiana of $44 million as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements; and the favorable impact of $28 million of a decrease in bad debt expense at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of lower energy prices of $75 million in the Dominican Republic; lower volume and energy prices of $66 million in Argentina; higher purchased energy prices of $48 million at Uruguaiana; and lower spot sales of $48 million at Panama. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 18% while gross margin decreased 3%, primarily due to reduced energy purchases, fewer outages and lower bad debt expense. 131 Table of Contents Latin America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in Latin America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Latin America Utilities Revenue $ 7,222 $ 6,092 $ 5,907 19 % 3 % Gross Margin $ 1,072 $ 918 $ 886 17 % 4 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $697 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2010 increased $433 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $316 million, primarily in Brazil, due to increased market demand; and higher tariffs of $114 million primarily related to the July 2009 tariff reset in Brazil partially offset by the unfavorable impact on rates at Eletropaulo in Brazil of a cumulative adjustment to regulatory liabilities and higher energy prices across our Latin America utility businesses associated with energy purchases passed through to customers of $97 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $107 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $47 million, or 5%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $163 million, primarily in Brazil, due to the increased market demand; and lower contingencies of $142 million in Eletropaulo primarily related to labor contingencies which included a one time reversal, reflecting an agreement with Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o CESP, the pension plan administrator, of $51 million associated with claims for past benefit obligations which will now be accounted for as a component of the pension plan. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $238 million primarily due to the recovery in 2009 of a municipality receivable previously written off in Brazil and higher salaries and other employee related costs, provisions for commercial losses, regulatory penalties and maintenance costs; and $28 million related to the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $442 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2009 increased $627 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $560 million reflecting the recovery of energy purchases of $453 million that were passed through to customers at our utilities in Brazil and El Salvador; and higher volume in Brazil of $62 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $62 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2009 increased $94 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $107 million in El Salvador and Brazil; a $64 million recovery of a municipality receivable previously written off; 132 Table of Contents a non recurring PIS/COFINS fine in 2008 of $33 million; and higher volume of $32 million across the region. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of higher fixed costs of $120 million mainly related to pension expense, labor contingencies and maintenance costs in Brazil. North America Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Generation Revenue $ 1,972 $ 1,940 $ 2,234 2 % 13 % Gross Margin $ 435 $ 477 $ 660 9 % 28 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $19 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $13 million, or 1%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased rates, volume and an availability bonus at TEG/TEP in Mexico of $41 million; higher volume, primarily due to fewer outages and higher rates, of $22 million at Merida in Mexico; higher volume of $19 million at Warrior Run in Maryland due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. These increases were partially offset by: a net decrease of $50 million in New York due to lower rates partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a net decrease of $18 million at Deepwater in Texas primarily due to lower volume; and a net decrease of $14 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3 million, generation gross margin for 2010 decreased $45 million, or 9%, from 2009 primarily due to: a net decrease of $94 million in New York due to lower rates and higher coal prices partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a decrease of $16 million at Deepwater due to lower volume and rates; a net decrease of $11 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage; a decrease of $9 million in Hawaii due to an unfavorable impact of mark to market derivatives; and a decrease of $7 million in Puerto Rico due to higher fixed costs. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase of $39 million in New York primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of lower contract and maintenance costs, and other employee related costs; 133 Table of Contents a net increase of $26 million at TEG/TEP due to a current year availability bonus and fewer outages partially offset by higher fuel prices; higher volume of $14 million at Warrior Run due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 2% while gross margin decreased 9%, primarily due to the change in rates in New York having a greater impact on gross margin than revenue. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $44 million, primarily in Mexico, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $250 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $107 million in New York due to a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a decrease of $80 million due to a reduction in natural gas prices at Merida; increased outages of $22 million, $21 million and $17 million at Warrior Run, TEG/TEP and New York, respectively; lower rates of $20 million at Deepwater; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives in New York of $11 million; and the unfavorable impact in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $9 million, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $174 million, or 26%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $72 million in New York driven by a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a $29 million unfavorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments on coal supply contracts in Hawaii as a result of a gain of $22 million in 2008 compared to a loss of $7 million in 2009; an increase in outages of $22 million and $6 million at Warrior Run and in New York, respectively; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives of $11 million and higher emission allowance purchases of $13 million in New York; and the unfavorable impact of $9 million in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 13% while gross margin decreased 28%, primarily due to the increase in coal prices in New York and the unfavorable impact of derivatives in 2009 in Hawaii that had no corresponding impact on revenue. 134 Table of Contents North America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Utilities Revenue $ 1,145 $ 1,068 $ 1,079 7 % 1 % Gross Margin $ 249 $ 239 $ 261 4 % 8 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Utilities revenue for 2010 increased $77 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail demand of $64 million as a result of warmer weather and higher fuel adjustment charges; and increased wholesale revenue of $11 million primarily due to higher prices. Utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $10 million, or 4%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail margin of $20 million due to increased demand; lower pension expense of $12 million; and lower emission allowance expense of $5 million. These increases were partially offset by: increased maintenance expenses of $16 million due to the timing of major generating unit overhauls; and increased fixed costs of $14 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 7% while gross margin increased 4%, primarily due to increased fuel and maintenance costs. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Utilities revenue for 2009 decreased $11 million, or 1%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower retail volume of $31 million due primarily to milder weather and the economic recession; and decreased wholesale revenue of $7 million driven by lower market prices. These decreases were partially offset by: $32 million of voluntary credits IPL provided to retail customers in 2008. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters North America of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these credits. Utilities gross margin for 2009 decreased $22 million, or 8%, from 2008 primarily due to: decreased wholesale margin of $16 million due to unfavorable prices; and increased pension expense of $25 million largely due to the decline in market value of IPLs pension assets during 2008. 135 Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by: increased retail margin of $15 million, primarily due to the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, partially offset by lower retail sales volumes in 2009; and decreased property tax expense of $5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 1% while gross margin decreased 8%, primarily due to the $25 million increase in pension expense and the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, both of which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. Europe Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Europe for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Europe Generation Revenue $ 1,362 $ 820 $ 1,143 66 % 28 % Gross Margin $ 268 $ 212 $ 273 26 % 22 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $41 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $583 million, or 71%, from 2009 primarily due to: $409 million from the adoption of new accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) which resulted in the consolidation of Cartagena in Spain, a generation business previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting; $117 million from the operations of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom, which was acquired in August 2010; $16 million from a full year of combined cycle operations at our Amman East plant in Jordan, which was single cycle until August 2009; higher tariffs of $16 million at Altai in Kazakhstan; higher volume of $15 million at Kilroot in the United Kingdom largely driven by coal pass through and increased demand, partially offset by lower capacity revenue due to the termination of the long term PPA and related supplementary agreements. These increases were partially offset by: lower volume and sales of emissions allowances in Hungary of $16 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $1 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $57 million, or 27%, from 2009 primarily due to: $62 million from the consolidation of Cartagena as discussed above; higher tariffs and lower fixed costs at Altai of $29 million; and $13 million from the operations of Ballylumford since its acquisition. 136 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: lower gross margin of $28 million primarily from the termination of the long term PPA at Kilroot; and lower gross margin of $20 million in Hungary primarily attributable to higher fuel costs that could not be passed through and lower sales of emission allowances. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 66% while gross margin increased 26%, primarily due to the consolidation of Cartagena and acquisition of Ballylumford that have a larger positive impact on revenue than gross margin, and the positive impact of higher energy revenue at Kilroot, which as a pass through had no corresponding impact on gross margin. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $146 million, driven mainly by Kilroot, Hungary and Kazakhstan, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $177 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower revenue of $101 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower volume of $81 million in Hungary due to the combined impact of the cancellation of one of our PPAs and reduced demand; and lower volume of $67 million at Kilroot, a coal fired plant, mainly driven by lower dispatch due to favorable gas prices compared to coal. These decreases were partially offset by: the benefit of new business of $50 million at Amman East, which commenced single cycle operations in July 2008; and higher rates of $15 million in Kazakhstan. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $35 million, driven mainly by Kilroot and Kazakhstan, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $26 million, or 10%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower gross margin of $41 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower demand of $12 million in Hungary; and an overall increase of $22 million in fixed costs across the region. These decreases were partially offset by: higher capacity revenue at Kilroot; higher energy prices in Kazakhstan; and the benefit of new business at Amman East. Asia Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Asia for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Asia Generation Revenue $ 618 $ 375 $ 345 65 % 9 % Gross Margin $ 240 $ 93 $ (10 ) 158 % 1030 % 137 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $28 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $215 million, or 57%, from 2009 primarily due to: favorable generation rates and volume of $210 million at Masinloc in the Philippines as a result of increased market demand and improved plant availability subsequent to the completion of its overhaul at the beginning of 2010; and higher demand from both new and existing contract and spot customers as a result of lower supply shortages in the Philippines power market due to a strong energy growth rate. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $13 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $134 million, or 144%, from 2009 primarily due to a combination of higher availability attributable to improved plant operations, higher market demand and favorable spot prices at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 65% while gross margin increased 158%, primarily due to the positive influence on gross margin due to favorable spot rates and operational efficiencies resulting from the Masinloc plant overhauls in late 2009 and early 2010, which led to higher availability and allowed for more efficient operations that have materially improved the operating results for 2010 as compared to 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $23 million, primarily in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, generation revenue for 2009 increased $53 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: the benefit of $46 million of our new business Masinloc, which was acquired in April 2008; increased revenue of $70 million in 2009 at Masinloc due to improved rates and volume as a result of improved availability and new customer contracts; and $18 million from a one time favorable energy sales settlement at Masinloc. These increases were partially offset by: the decrease in revenue of $71 million at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka primarily due to a decline in fuel costs which are largely passed through to the customer and higher outages in 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by higher capacity revenue. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $6 million, primarily in the Philippines, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $109 million, or 1,090%, from 2008 primarily due to: the impact of our new business at Masinloc of $23 million; a $91 million increase at Masinloc due to higher contract sales, where margins are more favorable than spot sales, lower fuel prices, improved availability and the favorable energy sales settlement described above; and higher capacity revenue at Kelanitissa of $10 million. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $20 million at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue increased 9% while gross margin increased 1,030%, primarily due to higher contract margins at Masinloc as a result of improved operations, availability and lower fuel prices, as well as the larger relative impact on gross margin from the one time favorable energy sales settlement described above. 138 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Corporate and other includes the net operating results from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, AES Wind Generation and renewables projects which are immaterial for the purposes of separate segment disclosure. The following table excludes inter segment activity and summarizes revenue and gross margin for Corporate and Other entities for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Revenue Europe Utilities $ 356 $ 286 $ 403 24 % 29 % Africa Utilities 422 370 379 14 % 2 % Africa Generation 61 65 65 6 % 0 % Wind Generation 202 133 128 52 % 4 % Corp/Other 25 16 37 56 % 57 % Total Corporate and Other $ 1,066 $ 870 $ 1,012 23 % 14 % Gross Margin Europe Utilities $ 21 $ 16 $ 34 31 % 53 % Africa Utilities 65 71 30 8 % 137 % Africa Generation 54 41 28 32 % 46 % Wind Generation 44 11 19 300 % 42 % Corp/Other 2 (22 ) (49 ) 109 % 55 % Total Corporate and Other $ 186 $ 117 $ 62 59 % 89 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $30 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other revenue increased $226 million for 2010, or 26% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: higher volume at our utility businesses in Ukraine driven by an overall increase in market demand; higher volume and utility tariffs at Sonel in Cameroon driven by an increase in market demand; and incremental revenue from new wind generation projects that commenced operations during the year and an overall volume increase across our wind businesses. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $8 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $77 million for 2010, or 66% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: an increase in gross margin from our new wind generation projects and higher volume, as discussed above; and an increase in volume at Dibamba, our generation business, in Cameroon. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs at Sonel. 139 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $162 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other revenue increased $20 million for 2009, or 2%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: higher tariffs in Ukraine of $27 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $12 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $67 million for 2009, or 108%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: a decrease in fixed costs across the Africa region. The increase was partially offset by: higher fuel consumption attributable to lower hydrology at Sonel. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense includes those expenses related to corporate and region staff functions and or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems, and development costs. General and administrative expenses increased $53 million, or 16%, to $392 million in 2010 from 2009. The increase is primarily related to business development costs associated with increased development efforts, primarily in Europe, Turkey and India. General and administrative expenses decreased $29 million, or 8%, to $339 million in 2009 from 2008. The decrease is primarily related to 2008 professional fees associated with remediation efforts and a reduction in business development costs. The favorable variance is partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the worldwide implementation of SAP. Interest expense Interest expense increased $41 million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to interest expense at Cartagena which is now a consolidated entity, higher interest rates at Tiet&ecirc;, increased debt principal at Eletropaulo and interest being expensed related to St. Nikola, our wind project in Bulgaria, due to commencement of operations in 2010. These increases were partially offset by reduced debt principal at the Parent Company. Interest expense decreased $285 million, or 16%, to $1.5 billion in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates globally due to economic conditions and inflationary adjustments to the market price index in Brazil. In addition, interest expense decreased as a result of favorable foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil and lower interest expenses associated with decreased debt balances at Eletropaulo. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense at Masinloc in the Philippines which was acquired in April 2008, and interest expense at Infovias in Brazil where a fee on a non exercised credit line was written off. Interest income Interest income increased $63 million, or 18%, to $411 million in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to a higher average balance in short term investments at Eletropaulo and the favorable impact of 140 Table of Contents foreign currency translation in Brazil as well as the settlement of a dispute related to inflation adjustments for energy sales at Tiet&ecirc;. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest income from a loan to a wind development project in Brazil which was repaid in June 2010. Interest income decreased $171 million, or 33%, to $348 million in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances in Brazil, unfavorable foreign currency translation in Brazil, the impact of decreased interest rates and inflationary adjustments on accounts receivable in 2008 at Gener in Chile and a decreased cash balance at the Parent Company. Other income Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Gain on extinguishment of tax and other liabilities $ 65 $ 168 $ 199 Tax credit settlement 129 Performance incentive fee 80 Insurance proceeds 40 Gain on sale of assets 12 14 34 Other 31 74 102 Total other income $ 108 $ 465 $ 375 Other income of $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to the extinguishment of a swap liability owed by two of our Brazilian subsidiaries, resulting in the recognition of a $62 million gain. The net impact to the Company after taxes and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Other income also included a gain on sale of assets at Eletropaulo. Other income of $465 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $165 million from the reduction in interest and penalties associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the REFIS program and a $129 million gain related to a favorable court decision enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. The net impact to the Company after income taxes and noncontrolling interests for these items was $44 million. In addition, the Company recognized income in 2009 of $80 million from a performance incentive bonus for management services provided to Ekibastuz and Maikuben in 2008. The management agreement was related to the sale of these businesses in Kazakhstan in May 2008; see further discussion of this transaction in Note 22 Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Other income of $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included gains on the extinguishment of a gross receipts tax liability and a legal contingency at Eletropaulo of $117 million and $75 million, respectively, $32 million of cash proceeds related to a favorable legal settlement at Southland in California, $29 million of insurance recoveries for damaged turbines at Uruguaiana, $23 million of gains associated with a sale of land at Eletropaulo and sales of turbines at Itabo, and compensation of $18 million for the impairment associated with the settlement agreement to shut down Hefei. 141 Table of Contents Other expense Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Loss on sale and disposal of assets $ 84 $ 42 $ 34 Gener gas settlement 72 Loss on extinguishment of debt 37 70 AES Wind transaction costs 22 Other 24 69 57 Total other expense $ 239 $ 111 $ 161 Other expense of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $72 million for a settlement agreement of gas transportation contracts at Gener. There were also previously capitalized transaction costs of $22 million that were incurred in connection with the preparation for the sale of a noncontrolling interest in our Wind Generation business which were written off upon the expiration of the letter of intent in June 2010. In addition, there were losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo, Panama, and Gener, an $18 million loss on debt extinguishment at Andres and Itabo and a $15 million loss at the Parent Company from the retirement of senior notes. Other expense of $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $13 million loss recognized when three of our businesses in the Dominican Republic received $110 million par value bonds issued by the Dominican Republic government to settle existing accounts receivable for the same amount from the government owned distribution companies. The loss represented an adjustment to reflect the fair value of the bonds on the date received. Other expense also included losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo and Andres and contingencies at our businesses in Kazakhstan and Alicura in Argentina. Other expense of $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $69 million of losses on the retirement of debt at the Parent Company in connection with the refinancing in June 2008 and IPALCO associated with a $375 million refinancing in April 2008 and losses on disposal of assets primarily at Eletropaulo. Goodwill Impairment In 2010, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2010, Deepwater, our pet coke fired merchant generation facility in Texas, determined that there was an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. This determination was primarily based on managements decision not to operate the plant for more than 30 days in the third quarter of 2010, current operating and cash flow losses, and forecasted operating and cash flow losses for the remainder of 2010 through 2014 as a result of declining trends in energy pricing curves and increasing pet coke prices. As a result, Deepwater recognized a goodwill impairment of $18 million. Deepwater is reported in the North America Generation segment. In 2009, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $122 million. This was a result of impairment at certain of our businesses in the United Kingdom and Ukraine as a result of the Companys annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of October 1. The most significant goodwill impairment was at Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom. Factors contributing to the recognition of impairment included: reduced profit expectations based on latest estimates of future commodity prices and reduced expectations on the recovery of cash flows on the existing plant following the Companys decision to forgo capital expenditures to meet emission allowance requirements taking effect in 2024. The fair value of the Companys reporting units are inherently sensitive to the assumptions underlying the estimates of fair value. Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Fair Value, Goodwill and Intangibles in Item 8 of this Form 10 K provides a 142 Table of Contents more detailed discussion of those assumptions. As discussed in Key Trends and Uncertainties, in the future, the fair values of the Companys reporting units might decline as a result of adverse changes in their operating environments or the businesses reaching the end of their finite lives, which could require the Company to record additional goodwill impairment charges. The Company did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2008. Asset Impairment Expense As discussed in Note 19 Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, asset impairment expense for the year 2010 was $1,221 million and consisted primarily of the following: Eastern Energy AEE operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated a recoverability test of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Southland In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and the exact form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process 143 Table of Contents through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations and the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. The Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment. The asset group was determined to be at the individual plant level and based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined that the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the Huntington Beach asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying value of the Huntington Beach plant of $288 million exceeded the fair value of $88 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $200 million. The undiscounted cash flows of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach generation facilities exceeded their respective carrying values and resulted in no impairment. Huntington Beach is reported in the North America Generation reportable segment. Tisza II During the third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into annual negotiations with the offtaker of its Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. As a result of these preliminary negotiations, as well as the further deterioration of the economic environment in Hungary, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. Thus, the Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and determined that based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount of the Tisza II asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The carrying value of the Tisza II asset group of $160 million exceeded the fair value of $75 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $85 million. Tisza II is reported in the Europe Generation reportable segment. Deepwater In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW pet coke fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, 144 Table of Contents all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Asset impairment expense for the year 2009 was $25 million. In 2009, the Company recognized a pre tax long lived asset impairment charge of $11 million related to the Companys Piabanha hydro project in Brazil. The Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows and abandoned the project. Asset impairment expense for the year 2008 was $175 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, the Company reviewed and prioritized projects in the development pipeline. From this review, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows for certain projects. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $75 million ($34 million, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes) related to two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non power development project at one of our facilities in North America. During 2008, the Company recognized additional impairment charges of $36 million related to long lived assets at Uruguaiana. The impairment was triggered by a combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy in 2007 that continued in 2008. Following an initial impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, further charges were incurred in 2008 due to fixed asset purchase agreements in place. During the first half of 2008, the Company withdrew from projects in South Africa and Israel which resulted in impairment charges of $36 million. The Company also recognized an impairment of $18 million related to the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China. Gain on sale of investments There was no gain on sale of investments in 2010. Gain on sale of investments of $131 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $98 million recognized in May 2009 related to the termination of the management agreement between the Company and Kazakhmys PLC for Ekibastuz and Maikuben, a gain of $14 million from the sale of the remaining assets associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China and $13 million from the reversal of a contingent liability related to the Kazakhstan sale in 2008. Gain on sale of investments of $909 million in 2008 consisted primarily of the sale in May 2008 of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Ekibastuz and Maikuben for a net gain of $905 million. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock There was no loss on sale of subsidiary stock in 2010 or 2009. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock of $31 million in 2008 was the result of sales of AES Gener shares made by our wholly owned subsidiary Cachagua. In November 2008, Cachagua sold 9.6% of its ownership in Gener to a third party reducing its ownership in Gener to 70.6%. 145 Table of Contents Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Companys net monetary position from foreign currency transaction activities: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) AES Corporation $ (50 ) $ 13 $ 38 Chile 8 65 (96 ) Philippines 8 15 (57 ) Brazil (6 ) (9 ) (44 ) Argentina 12 (10 ) (28 ) Kazakhstan 1 (24 ) 14 Colombia (4 ) (11 ) 5 Other (2 ) (6 ) (16 ) Total(1) $ (33 ) $ 33 $ (184 ) (1) Includes (losses) gains of $(10) million, $(39) million and $10 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These losses consisted primarily of losses at The AES Corporation partially offset by gains in Argentina. Losses of $50 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the devaluation of notes receivable resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound, and losses on foreign exchange swaps and options, partially offset by gains on cash balances and debt denominated in British Pounds. Gains of $12 million in Argentina were primarily due to a gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso by 5%, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These gains consisted primarily of gains in Chile, the Philippines and at The AES Corporation partially offset by losses in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. Gains of $65 million in Chile were primarily due to the appreciation of the Chilean Peso of 20% resulting in gains at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Peso, mainly cash and accounts receivables. This gain was partially offset by $14 million in losses on foreign currency derivatives. Gains of $15 million in the Philippines were primarily due to the appreciation of the Philippine Peso of 3%, resulting in gains at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on the remeasurement of U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $13 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the settlement of the senior unsecured credit facility and the revaluation of notes receivable denominated in the Euro, partially offset by losses on debt denominated in British Pounds. Losses of $24 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar and $12 million of foreign currency transaction losses on debt and other liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Kazakh Tenge. 146 Table of Contents Losses of $11 million in Colombia were primarily due to the appreciation of the Colombian Peso of 9%, resulting in losses at Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its Colombian Peso denominated debt and losses on foreign currency derivatives. Losses of $10 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2009, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt, partially offset by derivative gains. Losses of $9 million in Brazil were primarily due to energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar, resulting in foreign currency transaction losses of $18 million, partially offset by gains of $9 million due to the appreciation in 2009 of the Brazilian Real of 25%, resulting in gains at Sul and Uruguaiana associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These losses consisted primarily of losses in Chile, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina partially offset by gains at The AES Corporation and in Kazakhstan. Losses of $96 million in Chile were primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso of 28% in 2008, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable and value added tax (VAT) receivables. Losses of $57 million in the Philippines were primarily due to remeasurement losses at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on U.S. Dollar denominated debt resulting from depreciation of the Philippine Peso of 14% in 2008. Losses of $44 million in Brazil were primarily due to the realization of deferred exchange variance on past energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar. Losses of $28 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2008, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $38 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to debt denominated in British Pounds and gains on foreign exchange derivatives, partially offset by losses on notes receivable denominated in the Euro. Gains of $14 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction gains of $16 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar, offset by $5 million of foreign currency transaction losses on external and intercompany debt denominated in other than the Kazakh Tenge functional currency. Income taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $292 million, or 49%, to $307 million in 2010. The Companys effective tax rates were 29% for 2010 and 26% for 2009. The net increase in the 2010 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 relating to the CEMIG sale transaction, tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowances at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, and $165 million of non taxable income recorded in 2009 at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program. These items were offset by income tax benefits related to a reversal of withholding tax liabilities at certain Chilean subsidiaries and 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries. Included in the net tax expense related to the CEMIG sale transaction is tax expense on the equity earnings associated with the reversal of the net long term liability and tax benefit related to release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. 147 Table of Contents Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $172 million, or 22%, to $599 million in 2009. The Companys effective tax rates were 26% for 2009 and 29% for 2008. The net decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowance at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recorded at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $91 million, or 99%, to $183 million in 2010 from $92 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a gain recognized upon the sale of our interest in CEMIG during the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by 2009 equity in earnings of Cartagena which was accounted for as a consolidated entity in 2010 and thus reported directly within revenues and expenses. Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $59 million, or 179%, to $92 million in 2009 from $33 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a cash settlement received by Cartagena, in Spain, in June 2009 for liquidated damages received related to a construction delay from December 2005 to November 2006; increased earnings at Guacolda in Chile mainly due to lower cost of coal; increased earnings of Chigen affiliates from higher tariffs partially offset by lower volume and a valuation write off in 2008 at an affiliate in Turkey. These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings at OPGC, in India, mainly due to lower tariff and a dividend distribution tax in March 2009 and increased expenses for an equipment overhaul at Elsta in the Netherlands. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $93 million, or 8%, to $1.0 billion in 2010 from $1.1 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreased earnings at Eletropaulo as a result of the absence of legal settlement income present in 2009, a loss on legal settlement at Gener and reduced revenues due to decreased coal prices along with higher electricity purchases at Itabo. These decreases were partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian Real. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $340 million, or 45%, to $1.1 billion in 2009 from $0.8 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to increases in gross margin and other income, lower interest expense and a decrease in impairments in 2009 at our Brazilian businesses, and increases in gross margin and foreign currency transaction gains at our businesses in Chile. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $44 million at certain of our wind generation businesses as a result of a charge related to the potential future taxes that could be deemed due in the calculation of the hypothetical liquidation value of certain of our wind tax equity partnerships. Discontinued operations As further discussed in Note 21 Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Businesses to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, Discontinued Operations includes the results of five businesses: Ras Laffan, a generation business in Qatar (sold in October 2010); Barka, a generation business in Oman, (sold in August 2010); Lal Pir and Pak Gen, generation businesses in Pakistan, (sold in June 2010); and Jiaozuo, a generation business in China, (sold in December 2008). Prior periods have been restated to reflect these businesses within Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. In 2010, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $39 million and reflected the operations of our 55% stake in Ras Laffan, a combined cycle gas facility and water desalination plant in Qatar, our 35% stake in Barka, a combined cycle gas 148 Table of Contents facility and water desalination plant in Oman and our 55% stake in Lal Pir and Pak Gen, two oil fired facilities in Pakistan. The sale of Lal Pir and Pak Gen closed in June 2010, resulting in additional impairment expense and a loss on the sale in 2010 of $14 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The Barka plant was sold in August 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $63 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The sale of Ras Laffan closed in October 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $6 million, net of tax. In 2009, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $54 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir and Pak Gen. Loss on disposal of discontinued businesses, net of tax and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $105 million and represented the difference between the net book value of the Companys interests in its Pakistan businesses and their estimated fair value. In 2008, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $60 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir, Pak Gen and Jiaozuo, a coal fired generation facility in China sold in December 2008. The Company received $73 million for its 70% interest in the business. The net gain on the disposition was $7 million. Critical Accounting Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Companys most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Reserves We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the tax jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material. 149 Table of Contents On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act). The Act includes several provisions which provide for tax relief for businesses by extending certain tax benefits and credits, including the Subpart F exception for active financing income and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look through provisions of Subpart F. This legislation resulted in a benefit for the Companys 2010 provision for income taxes; however, there can be no assurances that the benefits of this legislation will extend beyond 2011, when it is currently scheduled to expire. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Goodwill and Other Intangibles and Long lived Assets, respectively, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level on October 1. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying amount. A long lived asset (asset group) will be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e., the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are less than its carrying amount. In the event that the carrying amount of the long lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment evaluation is performed, in which the fair value of the asset is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. Examples of indicators that would result in an impairment test for goodwill and a recoverability test for long lived assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate, legislation changes or a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition. Throughout the impairment evaluation process, management makes considerable judgments; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part of an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost/benefit analysis and the Companys internal valuation knowledge of the long lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the DCF model), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factors expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. 150 Table of Contents A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Managements Discussion and Analysis, Consolidated Results of Operations Goodwill Impairment and Asset Impairment Expense and Note 19 Impairment Expense and Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Fair Value Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent), derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long term liabilities. The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Companys investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Companys derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where 151 Table of Contents derivatives qualify and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Companys interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Companys derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterpartys) and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Platts). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instruments fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on indicative pricing quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities The Company adopted the fair value measurement accounting guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009. The most significant of these estimates surround the fair value measurement of long lived tangible and intangible assets when tested for impairment upon a triggering event or during the annual impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill. These estimates include making assumptions regarding useful life, the impact of economic obsolescence and expected future cash flows. Additional factors are discussed above in the Impairments section. 152 Table of Contents Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard creates a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity Parent Company Liquidity. Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010. While the lenders under our non recourse project financings generally do not have direct recourse to The AES Corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by The AES Corporation), defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for The AES Corporation, including, without limitation: reducing The AES Corporations receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to The AES Corporation during the pendency of any default; triggering The AES Corporations obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support which The AES Corporation has provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary; causing The AES Corporation to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; triggering defaults in The AES Corporations outstanding debt and trust preferred securities. For example, The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries; the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the Company; or foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the nonrecourse loans, therefore eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets. None of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that meet the applicable definition of materiality in The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of future mix of distributions, write down of assets, dispositions and other matters that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the applicable definition of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiarys debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under The AES Corporations senior secured credit facility. The risk of such defaults may have increased as a result of the deteriorating global economy. For further 77 Table of Contents discussion of these conditions, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions of this Form 10 K. Risks Associated with our Ability to Raise Needed Capital The AES Corporation has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity. The AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund: principal repayments of debt; interest and preferred dividends; acquisitions; construction and other project commitments; other equity commitments, including business development investments; equity repurchases; taxes; and Parent Company overhead costs. The AES Corporations principal sources of liquidity are: dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level; and proceeds from asset sales. For a more detailed discussion of The AES Corporations cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity of this Form 10 K. While we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the Parent Company level for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. Any number of assumptions could prove to be incorrect and therefore there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. For example, in recent years, certain financial institutions have gone bankrupt. In the event that a bank who is party to our senior secured credit facility or other facilities goes bankrupt or is otherwise unable to fund its commitments, we would need to replace that bank in our syndicate or risk a reduction in the size of the facility, which would reduce our liquidity. In addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding under our credit facilities and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us. Our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to raise capital on favorable terms. From time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: general economic and capital market conditions; the availability of bank credit; 78 Table of Contents investor confidence; the financial condition, performance and prospects of The AES Corporation in general and or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing as well as companies in our industry or similar financial circumstances; and changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital. Should future access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants or expand or improve existing facilities, either of which would affect our future growth, results of operations or financial condition. A downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets which could increase our interest costs or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow. If any of the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs would increase. Furthermore, depending on The AES Corporations credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debt securities, counterparties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, The AES Corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporation. There can be no assurance that such counterparties will accept such guarantees or that AES could arrange such further assurances in the future. In addition, to the extent The AES Corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of credit available to The AES Corporation to meet its other liquidity needs. We may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund greenfield projects in certain less developed economies which could change or in some cases adversely affect our growth strategy. Part of our strategy is to grow our business by developing Generation and Utility businesses in less developed economies where the return on our investment may be greater than projects in more developed economies. Commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non recourse project financing in certain less developed economies, and in these situations we have sought and will continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. As a precondition to making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees of certain project and sovereign related risks. There can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the project or invest more of our own funds which may not be in line with our investment objectives and would leave less funds for other projects. These risks have increased as a result of the recent credit crisis and the deteriorating global economy. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential impact on the Company, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. External Risks Associated with Revenue and Earnings Volatility Our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Some of our businesses sell electricity in the wholesale spot markets in cases where they operate wholly or partially without long term power sales agreements. Our Generation and Utility businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in 79 Table of Contents those markets. The open market wholesale prices for electricity are very volatile and often reflect the fluctuating cost of coal, natural gas or oil. Consequently, any changes in the supply and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity. Volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from among other things: plant availability in the markets generally; availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties; competition; demand for energy commodities; electricity usage; seasonality; interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuation; availability and price of emission credits; input prices; hydrology and other weather conditions; illiquid markets; transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies; availability of competitively priced renewables sources; available supplies of natural gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal; generating unit performance; natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events; energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies; geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas; and general economic conditions in areas where we operate which impact energy consumption. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entitys functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. Dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the United States are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. Dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currencies where our subsidiaries outside the United States report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiarys functional currency. We also experience foreign transaction exposure to the extent monetary assets and liabilities, including debt, are in a different currency than the subsidiarys functional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial position and results of operations have been affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies, primarily the Euro, Brazilian real, Argentine peso, Chilean peso, Colombian peso and Philippine peso. 80 Table of Contents We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. We routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us hedge our interest rate exposure on variable rate debt. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management procedures we have in place may not always be followed or may not work as planned. In particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management system may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with basis risk which is the assumed relative correlation of performance between the intended hedge instrument and the targeted underlying exposure. Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform their obligations under these arrangements. In 2010, we faced substantial challenges in North America as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place but purchase fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. In particular, our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas have been affected by these conditions. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Impairments. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks. We often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could be lower than contracted prices and would expose these businesses to considerable price volatility. At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facilitys output, in some cases under long term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. We have also hedged a portion of our exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price power sales. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. If we were unable to enter into replacement PPAs, these businesses may have to sell power at market prices. 81 Table of Contents The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to The AES Corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. The market pricing of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in future periods. The market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future. Stock price movements on a quarter by quarter basis for the past two years are set forth in Item 5. Market Market Information of this Form 10 K. Factors that could affect the price of our common stock in the future include general conditions in our industry, in the power markets in which we participate and in the world, including environmental and economic developments, over which we have no control, as well as developments specific to us, including, risks that could result in revenue and earnings volatility as well as other risk factors described in this Item 1A. Risk Factors and those matters described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Risks Associated with our Operations We do a significant amount of business outside the United States, including in developing countries, which presents significant risks. A significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the United States and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. Part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in developing countries because the growth rates and the opportunity to implement operating improvements and achieve higher operating margins may be greater than those typically achievable in more developed countries. International operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region; adverse changes in currency exchange rates; government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds; unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies; high inflation and monetary fluctuations; restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate; threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments; difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with GAAP expertise; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties; inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems; adverse changes in government tax policy; 82 Table of Contents difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions. Any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, partly in response to challenging business and political conditions in Kazakhstan, in 2008, we sold certain businesses in that country. As another example, in the second quarter of 2007, we sold our stake in EDC to Petr&oacute;leos de Venezuela, S.A., the state owned energy company in Venezuela after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened to expropriate the electricity business in Venezuela. In connection with the sale, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $680 million. In addition, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenues and gross margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. The operation of power generation and distribution facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results. We and or our subsidiaries may not have adequate insurance coverage for liabilities. We are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including: changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, explosions, terrorist acts or other similar occurrences; and changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to: gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance. Our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations, or interruptions in transportation including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. This could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurring a liability for liquidated damages and or other penalties. As a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation and distribution industries, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to 83 Table of Contents transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or certain external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks. The hazards described above can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A claim for which we are not fully insured or insured at all could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our businesses insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with its operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results or operations, financial condition and prospects. Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our inability to attract and retain skilled people could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. In particular, we routinely are required to assess the financial and tax impacts of complicated business transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. These assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise in GAAP to timely and accurately comply with United States reporting obligations. An inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse affect on our financial and tax reporting. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for load requirements and may result in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. The uncertainty regarding the amount of power that our power generation and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our operating costs. A significant under or over estimation of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much power to cover their obligations, in which case we would be required to buy or sell power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. Those prices may not be favorable and thus could increase our operating costs. 84 Table of Contents We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. Even when we successfully enter into long term contracts, our generation businesses are often dependent on one or a limited number of customers and a limited number of fuel suppliers. Many of our generation plants conduct business under long term contracts. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plants output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts range from 1 to 25 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable. For example, during the past several years, various governmental authorities in Europe have terminated or declined to fulfill their obligations under long term contracts with our subsidiaries. In 2008, as part of the accession to the European Union, the Hungarian government terminated all long term PPAs, including AES Tiszas PPA, as of December 31, 2008. Partly as a result of the termination AES Tiszas results of operations declined and we were required to record an $85 million asset impairment charge for AES Tisza in the third quarter of 2010. Kilroot in Northern Ireland received notice from the Utility Regulator directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the Generating Unit Agreements for the two coal fired units effective November 1, 2010 and, as a result, the performance (and contributions to income and cash flow) from Kilroot will decline in 2011 when compared to prior years. Furthermore, these businesses (and any other businesses whose long term contracts may be challenged) may have to sell electricity into the spot markets. Because of the volatile nature of inputs and power prices, the inability to secure long term contracts could generate increased volatility in our earnings and cash flows and could generate substantial losses (or result in a write down of assets), which could have a material impact on our business and results of operations. We have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customers obligations. However, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment grade credit rating, and our Generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful. These risks have increased as a result of the deteriorating and volatile global economy. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential impact on the Company, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions in this Form 10 K. Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us. The power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain 85 Table of Contents markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas fired power plants have also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on us. Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions. Certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Of the twenty nine defined benefit plans, three are at United States subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. The Company periodically evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. The Companys exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans are more heavily weighted to investments in fixed income securities that have not been as severely impacted by the global recession. Future downturns in the debt and or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. Our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. This may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the Parent Company and our subsidiaries liquidity. For additional information regarding the funding position of the Companys pension plans, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Pension and Postretirement Obligations and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K. Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties. Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing greenfield power plants, some but not all of which have signed long term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to failures of siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. Timing of equipment purchases can also pose financial risks to the Company. As part of our development process, we attempt to make purchases of equipment and or materials as needed. However, from time to time, there may be excess demand for certain types of equipment with substantial delays between the time we place orders and receive delivery. In those instances, to avoid construction delays and costs associated with the inability to own and place such equipment and or materials into service when needed in the construction process, we may place orders well in advance of deployment. In some cases, we may order such equipment and or materials without yet having a specific project where the equipment and or materials will be deployed, in anticipation that equipment and materials will be needed at the time of delivery. However, there is a risk that at the time of delivery, we are required to accept delivery and pay for such equipment and or materials, even though no project has materialized where these items will be used. This can result in our having to incur material equipment and or material costs, with no deployment plan at delivery. Financing risk has also increased as a result of the deterioration of the global economy and the crisis in the financial markets and, as a result, we may forgo certain development opportunities. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are 86 Table of Contents recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, management believes that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this timeframe. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. Historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses may be government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that: we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership; such businesses will perform as expected; integration or other one time costs will not be greater than expected; we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities; such business will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest our capital to acquire them. 87 Table of Contents In some of our joint venture projects and businesses, we have granted protective rights to minority holders or we own less than a majority of the equity in the project or business and do not manage or otherwise control the project or business, which entails certain risks. We have invested in some joint ventures where we own less than a majority of the voting equity in the venture. Very often, one of our subsidiaries seeks to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of projects or businesses in which we have less than a majority of the ownership interests by operating the project or business pursuant to a management contract, negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we do not always have this type of control over the project or business in every instance; and we may be dependent on our co venturers to operate such projects or businesses. Our co venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally. The approval of co venturers also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. In some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders. For example, Companhia Brasiliana de Energia (Brasiliana) is a holding company in which we have a controlling equity interest and through which we own three of our four Brazilian businesses: Eletropaulo, Tiet&ecirc; and Uruguaiana. We entered into a shareholders agreement with an affiliate of the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) which owns more than 49% of the voting equity of Brasiliana. Among other things, the shareholders agreement requires the consent of both parties before taking certain corporate actions, grants both parties rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of interests in Brasiliana and grants certain drag along rights to BNDES. In May 2007, BNDES notified us that it intends to sell all of its interest in Brasiliana pursuant to a public auction (the Brasiliana Sale). BNDES also informed us that if we fail to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of its interest in Brasiliana, then BNDES intends to exercise its drag along rights under the shareholders agreement and cause us to sell all of our interests in Brasiliana in the Brasiliana Sale as well. BNDES has since suspended the auction; however, BNDES may determine to recommence a sale process in the future. In that event, after the auction, if a third party offer has been received in the Brasiliana Sale, we will have 30 days to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of BNDESs interest in Brasiliana on the same terms as the third party offer. If we do not exercise this right and BNDES proceeds to exercise its drag along rights, then we may be forced to sell all of our interest in Brasiliana. Due to the uncertainty in the sale price at this point in time, we are uncertain whether we will exercise our right of first refusal should BNDES receive a valid third party offer in the Brasiliana Sale and, if we do, whether we would do it alone or with joint venture partners. Even if we desire to exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot assure that we will have the cash on hand or that debt or equity financing will be available at acceptable terms in order to purchase BNDESs interest in Brasiliana. If we do not exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot be assured that we will not have to record a loss if the sale price is below the book value of our investment in Brasiliana. Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and regulatory challenges. AES Wind Generation, AES Solar, our greenhouse gas emissions reductions projects (GHG Emissions Reduction Projects), and our investments in projects such as energy storage are subject to substantial risks. Projects of this nature have been developed through advancement in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and which are unrelated to our core business. Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future. For example, several European countries have recently faced a debt crisis, which has or may result in government austerity measures. If these incentives are repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, this could materially impact our renewable businesses, results of operations and financial condition, and impact the ability of the affected 88 Table of Contents businesses to continue or grow their operations. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries, which could also have a material impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, production levels for our wind, solar, and GHG Emissions Reduction Projects may be dependent upon adequate wind, sunlight, or biogas production which can vary significantly from period to period, resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. For example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year. With regard to GHG Emissions Reduction Projects, there is particular uncertainty about whether agreements providing incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, such as the Kyoto Protocol, will continue and whether countries around the world will enact or maintain legislation that provides incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, without which such projects may not be economical or financing for such projects may become unavailable. As a result, renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. In addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in Generation and Utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that many of these projects exist in new or emerging markets, where long term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. These projects can be capital intensive and generally require that we obtain third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects. These risks may be exacerbated by the current global economic crisis, including our managements increased focus on liquidity, which may also result in slower growth in the number of projects we can pursue. The economic downturn could also impact the value of our assets in these countries and our ability to develop these projects. If the value of these assets decline, this could result in a material impairment or a series of impairments which are material in the aggregate, which would adversely affect our financial statements. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or long lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. The fair value of a reporting unit has been determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill outside of the required annual assessment process if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. There could also be impairments if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. See further discussion in Risk Factor, Our Acquisitions May Not Perform as Expected. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. As of December 31, 2010, we had $1.3 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3% of total assets. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to 89 Table of Contents impair goodwill, as further described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Long lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives. Long lived assets are evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of long lived assets, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates, commodity prices and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. Generally, the fair value of a long lived asset or asset group is determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each asset group. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or adverse action or assessment by a regulator. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in additional long lived asset impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to impair long lived assets, as further described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather. Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In the past, our businesses in Latin America have been negatively impacted by lower than normal rainfall. Similarly, our wind businesses are dependent on adequate wind conditions while the solar projects at AES Solar are dependent on sufficient sunlight. In each case, inadequate wind or sunlight could have a material adverse impact on these businesses. Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes. Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our Utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to: changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations; 90 Table of Contents changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utilitys operating income or the rates it charges customers is too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates; changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non controllable costs; adverse changes in tax law; changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium; changes in the timing of tariff increases; other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business. Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business. In many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing or the regulations can be difficult to interpret. As a result, there is risk that we may not properly interpret certain regulations and may not understand the impact of certain regulations on our business. For example, in October 2006, ANEEL, which regulates our utility operations at Sul and Eletropaulo in Brazil, issued Normative Resolution 234 requiring that utilities begin amortizing a liability called Special Obligations beginning with their second tariff reset cycle in 2007 or a later year as an offset to depreciation expense. As of May 23, 2007, the date of the filing of our 2006 Form 10 K, no industry positions or any other consensus had been reached regarding how ANEEL guidance should be applied at that date and accordingly, no adjustments to the financial statements were made relating to Special Obligations in Brazil. Subsequent to May 23, 2007, industry discussions occurred and other Brazilian companies filed Forms 20 F with the SEC reflecting the impact of Resolution 234 in their December 31, 2006 financial statements differently from how the Company accounted for Resolution 234. In the absence of any significant regulatory developments between May 23, 2007 and the date of these other filings, the Company determined that Resolution 234 required us to record an adjustment to our Special Obligations liability as of December 31, 2006. In part, the decision to record the adjustment led to the restatement of our financial statements in the third quarter of 2007. If we face additional challenges interpreting regulations or changes in regulations, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act). While the bulk of regulations contained in the Dodd Frank Act regulate financial institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive compensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to public companies generally. The types of provisions described above are currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Furthermore, while the Dodd Frank Act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, the Dodd Frank Act provides for commercial end user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions, though this is not certain since the Act directs the SEC, CFTC and listed companies to enact rules that will clarify the Dodd Frank Act, and such rulemaking could impact the availability of the commercial end user exemption. Even if the exemption is available, the Dodd Frank Act could still have a material adverse impact on the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non exempt companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these risks. Even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, which could adversely affect the operating results of certain projects; cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated to hedge certain risks, such as project financing agreements; prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; cause the Company to abandon certain of its hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; and or consume substantial liquidity by forcing the Company to post cash and or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 91 Table of Contents On June 12, 2009 AES Kelanitissa received a letter and an invoice from the Director General, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUC) seeking payment of an Annual Regulatory Fee and pursuant to PUC assurances on an application for renewal of the AES Kelanitissa generation license. The application is pursuant to an April 2009 revision of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act (Electricity Act), which came into force in April 2009, notwithstanding that in March 29, 2001, AES Kelanitissa had been granted, and pre paid fees for, a 21 year generation license with effect from September 25, 2000 under the Electricity Act, 1950. AES Kelanitissa submitted an application to be licensed under the revised legislation and, on August 26, 2009, PUC published its intention to issue a generation license under the revised legislation to AES Kelanitissa and other Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in Sri Lanka. This was consistent with assurances received from relevant authorities that the revised legislation was to be amended to grandfather IPPs with existing generation licenses. In a letter dated June 21, 2010 from the PUC, AES Kelanitissa was informed that under the new regulations, as amended in 2009, AES Kelanitissa (Pvt) Ltd no longer fulfilled the eligibility criteria to apply for a generation license. The eligibility criteria to which the letter refers is a provision requiring an element of state ownership. Representatives of AES Kelanitissa have been informed that an amendment to the Electricity Act to grandfather existing IPPs remains in the legislative pipeline, although it is not possible to predict with certainty when or whether such an amendment will be passed. In addition, AES Kelanitissa believes that under Sri Lankan law, it may continue operations under the 21 year license issued in 2001. No step has been taken to date to prohibit AES Kelanitissa from generating power and conducting its operations. However, in the event that it is determined that AES Kelanitissa may not operate under its current license or the revised legislation is not amended (and PUC maintains that AES Kelanitissa is ineligible for a generation license or extension of the Generating License), AES Kelanitissa may not be able to continue operations on grounds that it has no license under the revised legislation. In that event, AES Kelanitissa and or the Company could face a number of adverse consequences, including potential litigation with counterparties mitigating a write down in the value of the assets of the business, continued default status under its debt documents and or other consequences which could have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Our Generation business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the FERC, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations. EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the obligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of the Midwest Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) Interconnection, L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is authorized under the new law to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case by case basis. While the new law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to PURPA, our QFs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long term contracts expire. EPAct 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the United States generation market. 92 Table of Contents In accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets. While the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost of service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate. Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our activities are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air and water emissions. See the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters of this Form 10 K. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies. The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal fired generating plants alleging wide spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with approximately 17 companies over such allegations. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. The principal focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO2 and NOX. In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOX. One of our businesses, IPL, is currently the subject of such an EPA enforcement action, and another business, Eastern Energy, has received an information request from the EPA in connection with a possible enforcement action. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10 K for more detail with respect to these EPA enforcement actions and information requests. There can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations. 93 Table of Contents Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As discussed in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations, at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect or policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2010, the Companys subsidiaries operated businesses which had total approximate CO2 emissions of 77.2 million metric tonnes approximately 40 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 18 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based upon a number of projections and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect such as the forecast dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO2 emissions and our subsidiaries achieving completion of such construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with emissions described below. Because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates. The subsidiaries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there can be no assurance that the subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the Company. Foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial performance. The actual impact on the Companys financial performance and the financial performance of the Companys subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the cost of emissions reduction equipment the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material impact on our results of operations. In January 2005, based on European Community Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading, the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) commenced operation as the largest multi country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the 40 developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO2. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In the United States, there currently is no legislation establishing federal mandatory GHG emission reduction programs (including CO2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. However, federal GHG legislation has been proposed in the United States Congress that would, if enacted, constrain GHG emissions, including CO2, and or impose costs on 94 Table of Contents us that could be material to our business or results of operations. The EPA has also initiated regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new sources of GHG emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing sources planning physical changes that would increase their GHG emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. Such regulations could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse effect on our business and or results of operations. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regulations. At the state level, RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast, became effective in January 2009, and the WCI is also developing market based programs to address GHG emissions in seven western states. In addition, several states, including California, have adopted comprehensive legislation that, when effective, will require mandatory GHG reductions from several industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about the United States state environmental regulations we face. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below), the Company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with United States federal, regional or state CO2 emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that these proposals are in earlier stages of development and any final regulations or legislation, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. The RGGI program became effective in January 2009. The first regional auction of RGGI allowances needed to be acquired by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI was held in September 2008, with subsequent auctions occurring approximately every quarter. Our subsidiaries in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland are subject to RGGI. Of the approximately 40 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2010 (ownership adjusted), approximately 11.3 million metric tonnes were emitted in United States states participating in RGGI. Over the past three years, such emissions have averaged approximately 10.9 million metric tonnes. While CO2 emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of CO2 compliance based on a 3 year average of CO2 emissions for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes a price of $1.86 per allowance under RGGI. The source of this allowance price estimate was the clearing price in the recent RGGI allowance auction held in December 2010. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $15 million for 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance. In addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. For example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. In addition, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. In addition, environmental groups and other private plaintiffs have brought and may decide to bring additional private lawsuits against the Company because of its subsidiaries GHG emissions. The Company is facing and may face in the future private lawsuits relating to GHG emissions that may have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. In one recent case in the United States, which does not involve the Company, a federal appellate court reversed the dismissal by a federal district court of nuisance and other claims against emitters of GHG based on property damage allegedly caused by their contributions to global warming. While the scope of relief sought in that case is 95 Table of Contents unclear, the plaintiffs in this case evidently seek injunctive relief to prevent or reduce further GHG emissions. The defendants appealed the appellate court decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court is expected to render a decision in 2011. If the defendants do not prevail, other parties may be encouraged to bring similar suits against electric power generators, including the Company or any of its United States subsidiaries. Also, unless the United States Congress acts to preempt such suits as part of comprehensive federal legislation, additional lawsuits may be brought against the Company or its subsidiaries. At this stage of the litigation, it is impossible to predict whether such lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the Companys business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Companys subsidiaries. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel fired electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation. In addition to potential physical risks noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of the Company and its subsidiaries due to public perception of GHG emissions by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHG emissions made by subsidiaries of the Company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the Company. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the Companys subsidiaries and on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our subsidiaries have operations in the United States and various non United States jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many non United States jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as non United States, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities. We and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. We and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. 96 Table of Contents The SEC is conducting an informal inquiry relating to our restatements. We have been cooperating with an informal inquiry by the SEC Staff concerning our past restatements and related matters, and have been providing information and documents to the SEC Staff on a voluntary basis. Although we have not received correspondence regarding this inquiry for some time, we have not been advised that the matter is closed. Because we are unable to predict the outcome of this inquiry, the SEC Staff may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported the financial impact of the adjustments to previously filed financial statements and there may be a risk that the inquiry by the SEC could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate previously filed financial statements, amend prior filings or take other actions not currently contemplated. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We maintain offices in many places around the world, generally pursuant to the provisions of long and short term leases, none of which we believe are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are described in Item 1 of this Form 10 K, are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the projects related finance facility. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased. However, in a few instances, no accompanying project financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business, some of which are described below. The Company has accrued for litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has evaluated claims in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies that it deems both probable and reasonably estimable and accordingly, has recorded aggregate reserves for all claims for approximately $450 million and $482 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. These are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within accrued and other liabilities and other long term liabilities. A significant portion of these reserves relate to employment, non income tax and customer disputes in international jurisdictions, principally Brazil. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries, principally in Brazil, are defendants in a number of labor and employment lawsuits. The complaints generally seek unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or other relief. The subsidiaries have denied any liability and intend to vigorously defend themselves in all of these proceedings. There can be no assurance that this reserve will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise. The Company believes, based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. However, even where no reserve has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company, and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material. In 1989, Centrais El&eacute;tricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobr&aacute;s) filed suit in the Fifth District Court in the State of Rio de Janeiro against Eletropaulo Eletricidade de S&atilde;o Paulo S.A. (EEDSP) relating to the methodology for calculating monetary adjustments under the parties financing agreement. In April 1999, the Fifth District Court 97 Table of Contents found for Eletrobr&aacute;s and in September 2001, Eletrobr&aacute;s initiated an execution suit in the Fifth District Court to collect approximately R$1.10 billion ($659 million) from Eletropaulo (as estimated by Eletropaulo) and a lesser amount from an unrelated company, Companhia de Transmiss&atilde;o de Energia El&eacute;trica Paulista (CTEEP) (Eletropaulo and CTEEP were spun off from EEDSP pursuant to its privatization in 1998). In November 2002, the Fifth District Court rejected Eletropaulos defenses in the execution suit. Eletropaulo appealed and in September 2003, the Appellate Court of the State of Rio de Janeiro (AC) ruled that Eletropaulo was not a proper party to the litigation because any alleged liability had been transferred to CTEEP pursuant to the privatization. In June 2006, the Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) reversed the Appellate Courts decision and remanded the case to the Fifth District Court for further proceedings, holding that Eletropaulos liability, if any, should be determined by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulos subsequent appeals to the Special Court (the highest court within the SCJ) and the Supreme Court of Brazil were dismissed. Eletrobr&aacute;s later requested that the amount of Eletropaulos alleged debt be determined by an accounting expert appointed by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulo consented to the appointment of such an expert, subject to a reservation of rights. In February 2010, the Fifth District Court appointed an accounting expert to determine the amount of the alleged debt and the responsibility for its payment in light of the privatization, in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletrobr&aacute;s. Pursuant to its reservation of rights, Eletropaulo filed an interlocutory appeal with the AC asserting that the expert was required to determine the issues in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletropaulo, and that Eletropaulo should be entitled to take discovery and present arguments on the issues to be determined by the expert. In April 2010, the AC issued a decision agreeing with Eletropaulos arguments and directing the Fifth District Court to proceed accordingly. Eletrobr&aacute;s may restart the accounting proceedings at the Fifth District Court at any time, which would proceed according to the ACs April 2010 decision. In the Fifth District Court proceedings, the experts conclusions will be subject to the Fifth District Courts review and approval. If Eletropaulo is determined to be responsible for the debt, after the amount of the alleged debt is determined, Eletrobr&aacute;s will be entitled to resume the execution suit in the Fifth District Court at any time. If Eletrobr&aacute;s does so, Eletropaulo will be required to provide security in the amount of its alleged liability. In that case, if Eletrobr&aacute;s requests the seizure of such security and the Fifth District Court grants such request, Eletropaulos results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and in turn the Companys results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, in February 2008, CTEEP filed a lawsuit in the Fifth District Court against Eletrobr&aacute;s and Eletropaulo seeking a declaration that CTEEP is not liable for any debt under the financing agreement. The parties are disputing the proper venue for the CTEEP lawsuit. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In August 2000, the FERC announced an investigation into the organized California wholesale power markets to determine whether rates were just and reasonable. Further investigations involved alleged market manipulation. FERC requested documents from each of the AES Southland, LLC plants and AES Placerita, Inc. AES Southland and AES Placerita have cooperated fully with the FERC investigations. AES Southland was not subject to refund liability because it did not sell into the organized spot markets due to the nature of its tolling agreement. After hearings at FERC, AES Placerita was found subject to refund liability of $588,000 plus interest for spot sales to the California Power Exchange from October 2, 2000 to June 20, 2001. As FERC investigations and hearings progressed, numerous appeals on related issues were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Over the years, the Ninth Circuit issued several opinions that had the potential to expand the scope of the FERC proceedings and increase refund exposure for AES Placerita and other sellers of electricity. Following remand of one of the Ninth Circuit appeals in March 2009, FERC started a new hearing process involving AES Placerita and other sellers. In May 2009, AES Placerita entered into a settlement, approved by FERC in July 2009, concerning the claims before FERC against AES Placerita relating to the California energy crisis of 2000 2001, including the California refund proceeding. Pursuant to the settlement, AES Placerita paid $6 million and assigned a receivable of $168,119 due to it from the California Power Exchange in return for a release of all claims against it at FERC by the settling parties and other consideration. More than 98% of the buyers in the market elected to join the settlement. A small amount of AES Placeritas settlement payment was placed in escrow for buyers that did not join the settlement (non settling parties). It is unclear whether the escrowed funds will be enough to satisfy any additional sums that might be determined to be owed to 98 Table of Contents non settling parties at the conclusion of the FERC proceedings concerning the California energy crisis. However, any such additional sums are expected to be immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2009, one non settling party, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), filed an appeal of the FERCs approval of the settlement which is pending in the Ninth Circuit. SMUDs appeal has been stayed pending further order of the court. The settlement agreement is still effective and will continue to remain effective unless it is vacated by the Ninth Circuit. SMUD has reached a settlement in principal with buyers of electricity that, if approved by FERC, will leave only immaterial claims of non settling parties against AES Placerita. In August 2001, the Grid Corporation of Orissa, India, now Gridco Ltd. (Gridco), filed a petition against the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (CESCO), an affiliate of the Company, with the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC), alleging that CESCO had defaulted on its obligations as an OERC licensed distribution company, that CESCO management abandoned the management of CESCO, and asking for interim measures of protection, including the appointment of an administrator to manage CESCO. Gridco, a state owned entity, is the sole wholesale energy provider to CESCO. Pursuant to the OERCs August 2001 order, the management of CESCO was replaced with a government administrator who was appointed by the OERC. The OERC later held that the Company and other CESCO shareholders were not necessary or proper parties to the OERC proceeding. In August 2004, the OERC issued a notice to CESCO, the Company and others giving the recipients of the notice until November 2004 to show cause why CESCOs distribution license should not be revoked. In response, CESCO submitted a business plan to the OERC. In February 2005, the OERC issued an order rejecting the proposed business plan. The order also stated that the CESCO distribution license would be revoked if an acceptable business plan for CESCO was not submitted to and approved by the OERC prior to March 31, 2005. In its April 2, 2005 order, the OERC revoked the CESCO distribution license. CESCO has filed an appeal against the April 2, 2005 OERC order and that appeal remains pending in the Indian courts. In addition, Gridco asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Companys indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCOs financial obligations to Gridco. In December 2001, Gridco served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limited (AES ODPL), and Jyoti Structures (Jyoti) pursuant to the terms of the CESCO Shareholders Agreement between Gridco, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and CESCO (the CESCO arbitration). In the arbitration, Gridco appeared to be seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by Gridco. The Company counterclaimed against Gridco for damages. In June 2007, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting Gridcos claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to Gridco. The respondents counterclaims were also rejected. In September 2007, Gridco filed a challenge of the arbitration award with the local Indian court. In June 2008, Gridco filed a separate application with the local Indian court for an order enjoining the Company from selling or otherwise transferring its shares in Orissa Power Generation Corporation Ltd.s (OPGC), an equity method investment, and requiring the Company to provide security in the amount of the contested damages in the CESCO arbitration until Gridcos challenge to the arbitration award is resolved. In June 2010, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal awarded the Company some of its costs relating to the arbitration. In August 2010, Gridco filed a challenge of the cost award with the local Indian court. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In early 2002, Gridco made an application to the OERC requesting that the OERC initiate proceedings regarding the terms of OPGCs existing PPA with Gridco. In response, OPGC filed a petition in the Indian courts to block any such OERC proceedings. In early 2005, the Orissa High Court upheld the OERCs jurisdiction to initiate such proceedings as requested by Gridco. OPGC appealed that High Courts decision to the Supreme Court and sought stays of both the High Courts decision and the underlying OERC proceedings regarding the PPAs terms. In April 2005, the Supreme Court granted OPGCs requests and ordered stays of the High Courts decision and the OERC proceedings with respect to the PPAs terms. The matter is awaiting further hearing. 99 Table of Contents Unless the Supreme Court finds in favor of OPGCs appeal or otherwise prevents the OERCs proceedings regarding the PPAs terms, the OERC will likely lower the tariff payable to OPGC under the PPA, which would have an adverse impact on OPGCs financials. OPGC believes that it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In March 2003, the office of the Federal Public Prosecutor for the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (MPF) notified AES Eletropaulo that it had commenced an inquiry related to the BNDES financings provided to AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and the rationing loan provided to Eletropaulo, changes in the control of Eletropaulo, sales of assets by Eletropaulo and the quality of service provided by Eletropaulo to its customers, and requested various documents from Eletropaulo relating to these matters. In July 2004, the MPF filed a public civil lawsuit in the Federal Court of S&atilde;o Paulo (FSCP) alleging that BNDES violated Law 8429/92 (the Administrative Misconduct Act) and BNDESs internal rules by: (1) approving the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (2) extending the payment terms on the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (3) authorizing the sale of Eletropaulos preferred shares at a stock market auction; (4) accepting Eletropaulos preferred shares to secure the loan provided to Eletropaulo; and (5) allowing the restructurings of Light Servi&ccedil;os de Eletricidade S.A. and Eletropaulo. The MPF also named AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s as defendants in the lawsuit because they allegedly benefited from BNDESs alleged violations. In May 2006, the FCSP ruled that the MPF could pursue its claims based on the first, second, and fourth alleged violations noted above. The MPF subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal with the Federal Court of Appeals (FCA) seeking to require the FCSP to consider all five alleged violations. Also, in July 2006, AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s filed an interlocutory appeal with the FCA, which was subsequently consolidated with the MPFs interlocutory appeal, seeking a transfer of venue and to enjoin the FCSP from considering any of the alleged violations. In June 2009, the FCA granted the injunction sought by AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and transferred the case to the Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro. In May 2010, the MPF filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice challenging the transfer. The MPFs lawsuit before the FCSP has been stayed pending a final decision on the interlocutory appeals. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana (the successor of AES Transg&aacute;s) believe they have meritorious defenses to the allegations asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. AES Florestal, Ltd. (Florestal), had been operating a pole factory and had other assets, including a wooded area known as Horto Renner, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (collectively, Property). Florestal had been under the control of AES Sul (Sul) since October 1997, when Sul was created pursuant to a privatization by the Government of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. After it came under the control of Sul, Florestal performed an environmental audit of the entire operational cycle at the pole factory. The audit discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at the pole factory. The audit concluded that the prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia El&eacute;trica (CEEE), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. Sul and Florestal subsequently took the initiative of communicating with Brazilian authorities, as well as CEEE, about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. The Public Attorneys Office has initiated a civil inquiry (Civil Inquiry n. 24/05) to investigate potential civil liability and has requested that the police station of Triunfo institute a police investigation (IP number 1041/05) to investigate potential criminal liability regarding the contamination at the pole factory. The parties filed defenses in response to the civil inquiry. The Public Attorneys Office then requested an injunction which the judge rejected on September 26, 2008. The Public Attorneys office has a right to appeal the decision. The environmental agency (FEPAM) has also started a procedure (Procedure n. 088200567/059) to analyze the measures that shall be taken to contain and remediate the contamination. Also, in March 2000, Sul filed suit against CEEE in the 2nd Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre seeking to register in Suls name the Property that it acquired through the privatization but that remained registered in CEEEs name. During those proceedings, AES subsequently waived its claim to re register the Property and asserted a claim to recover the amounts paid for the Property. That claim is pending. In November 2005, the 7th Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre ruled that the Property must be returned to CEEE. CEEE has had sole possession of Horto Renner since September 2006 and of the rest of the Property since April 2006. In February 2008, Sul 100 Table of Contents and CEEE signed a Technical Cooperation Protocol pursuant to which they requested a new deadline from FEPAM in order to present a proposal. In March 2008, the State Prosecution office filed a Public Class Action against AES Florestal, AES Sul and CEEE, requiring an injunction for the removal of the alleged sources of contamination and the payment of an indemnity in the amount of R$6 million ($4 million). The injunction was rejected and the case is in the evidentiary stage awaiting the judges determination concerning the production of expert evidence. The above referenced proposal was delivered on April 8, 2008. FEPAM responded by indicating that the parties should undertake the first step of the proposal which would be to retain a contractor. In its response, Sul indicated that such step should be undertaken by CEEE as the relevant environmental events resulted from CEEEs operations. It is estimated that remediation could cost approximately R$14.7 million ($9 million). Discussions between Sul and CEEE are ongoing. In January 2004, the Company received notice of a Formulation of Charges filed against the Company by the Superintendence of Electricity of the Dominican Republic. In the Formulation of Charges, the Superintendence asserts that the existence of three generation companies (Empresa Generadora de Electricidad Itabo, S.A. (Itabo), Dominican Power Partners, and AES Andres BV) and one distribution company (Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S.A. (Este)) in the Dominican Republic, violates certain cross ownership restrictions contained in the General Electricity Law of the Dominican Republic. In February 2004, the Company filed in the First Instance Court of the National District of the Dominican Republic an action seeking injunctive relief based on several constitutional due process violations contained in the Formulation of Charges (Constitutional Injunction). In February 2004, the Court granted the Constitutional Injunction and ordered the immediate cessation of any effects of the Formulation of Charges, and the enactment by the Superintendence of Electricity of a special procedure to prosecute alleged antitrust complaints under the General Electricity Law. In March 2004, the Superintendence of Electricity appealed the Courts decision. In July 2004, the Company divested any interest in Este. The Superintendence of Electricitys appeal is pending. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July 2004, the Corporaci&oacute;n Dominicana de Empresas El&eacute;ctricas Estatales (CDEEE) filed lawsuits against Itabo, an affiliate of the Company, in the First and Fifth Chambers of the Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance for the National District. CDEEE alleges in both lawsuits that Itabo spent more than was necessary to rehabilitate two generation units of an Itabo power plant and, in the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, that those funds were paid to affiliates and subsidiaries of AES Gener and Coastal Itabo, Ltd. (Coastal), a former shareholder of Itabo, without the required approval of Itabos board of administration. In the First Chamber lawsuit, CDEEE seeks an accounting of Itabos transactions relating to the rehabilitation. In November 2004, the First Chamber dismissed the case for lack of legal basis. On appeal, in October 2005 the Court of Appeals of Santo Domingo ruled in Itabos favor, reasoning that it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute because the parties contracts mandated arbitration. The Supreme Court of Justice is considering CDEEEs appeal of the Court of Appeals decision. In the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, which also names Itabos former president as a defendant, CDEEE seeks $15 million in damages and the seizure of Itabos assets. In October 2005, the Fifth Chamber held that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute given the arbitration provisions in the parties contracts. The First Chamber of the Court of Appeal ratified that decision in September 2006. In a related proceeding, in May 2005, Itabo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to compel CDEEE to arbitrate its claims. The petition was denied in July 2005. Itabos appeal of that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has been stayed since September 2006. Further, in September 2006, in an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration, an arbitral tribunal determined that it lacked jurisdiction to decide arbitration claims concerning these disputes. Itabo believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In April 2006, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi (District Court) on behalf of certain individual plaintiffs and all residents and or property owners in the State of Mississippi who allegedly suffered harm as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, whose alleged greenhouse gas emissions contributed to alleged global 101 Table of Contents warming which, in turn, allegedly increased the destructive capacity of Hurricane Katrina. The plaintiffs assert unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy/aiding and abetting, public and private nuisance, trespass, negligence, and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment claims against the defendants. The plaintiffs seek damages relating to loss of property, loss of business, clean up costs, personal injuries and death, but do not quantify their alleged damages. In August 2007, the District Court dismissed the case. The plaintiffs subsequently appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which, in October 2009, affirmed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs unjust enrichment, fraudulent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy claims. However, the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence claims, and remanded those claims to the District Court for further proceedings. In February 2010, the Fifth Circuit granted the petitions for en banc rehearing filed by the Company and other defendants, and thereby vacated its October 2009 decision. In May 2010, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had lost its quorum for en banc review. In August 2010, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the U.S. Supreme Court, requesting the Supreme Court to direct the Fifth Circuit to reinstate the appeal and return it to the panel that issued the October 2009 decision. In January 2011, the Supreme Court denied the petition, ending the case. In July 2007, the Competition Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the Competition Committee) ordered Nurenergoservice, an AES subsidiary, to pay approximately KZT 18 billion ($120 million) for alleged antimonopoly violations in 2005 through the first quarter of 2007. The Competition Committees order was affirmed by the economic court in April 2008 (April 2008 Decision). The economic court also issued an injunction to secure Nurenergoservices alleged liability, freezing Nurenergoservices bank accounts and prohibiting Nurenergoservice from transferring or disposing of its property. Nurenergoservices subsequent appeals to the court of appeals were rejected. In February 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency (the Competition Committees successor) seized approximately KZT 783 million ($5 million) from a frozen Nurenergoservice bank account in partial satisfaction of Nurenergoservices alleged damages liability. However, on appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court, in October 2009, the Supreme Court annulled the decisions of the lower courts because of procedural irregularities and remanded the case to the economic court for reconsideration. On remand, in January 2010, the economic court reaffirmed its April 2008 Decision. Nurenergoservices appeals in the court of appeals (first panel) and the court of appeals (second panel) were unsuccessful. Nurenergoservice intends to file a further appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court. In separate but related proceedings, in August 2007, the Competition Committee ordered Nurenergoservice to pay approximately KZT 1.8 billion ($12 million) in administrative fines for its alleged antimonopoly violations. Nurenergoservices appeal to the administrative court was rejected in February 2009. Given the adverse court decisions against Nurenergoservice, the Antimonopoly Agency may attempt to seize Nurenergoservices remaining assets, which are immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Antimonopoly Agency has not indicated whether it intends to assert claims against Nurenergoservice for alleged antimonopoly violations post first quarter 2007. Nurenergoservice believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it; however, there can be no assurances that it will prevail in these proceedings. In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of the power sales of Ust Kamenogorsk HPP (UK HPP) and Shulbinsk HPP, hydroelectric plants under AES concession (collectively, the Hydros), in January through February 2009. The investigation of Shulbinsk HPP is ongoing, but the investigation of UK HPP has been completed. The Antimonopoly Agency determined that UK HPP abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power in January through February 2009. The Agency sought an order from the administrative court requiring UK HPP to pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 120 million ($1 million) and to disgorge profits for the period at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately KZT 440 million ($3 million). No fines or damages have been paid to date, however, as the proceedings in the administrative court have been suspended due to the initiation of related criminal proceedings against officials of UK HPP. The Hydros believe they have meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. 102 Table of Contents In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of Ust Kamenogorsk TETS LLPs (UKT) power sales in 2008 through February 2009. The Antimonopoly Agency subsequently concluded that UKT abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power and should pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 136 million ($1 million). The Antimonopoly Agency later sought an order from the administrative court requiring UKT to pay the fine. The administrative court proceedings have been suspended due to a related criminal investigation of UKT employees. If the investigation is terminated and the Antimonopoly Agency prevails in the administrative proceedings, UKT may be ordered to pay the administrative fine and disgorge the profits from the sales at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately 514 million KZT ($3 million). UKT believes it has meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In December 2007, an arbitral tribunal terminated ESSAs gas supply contracts with members of the Sierra Chata Consortium in light of the restrictions that had been placed on the export of gas by the Argentine Republic. ESSA thereafter terminated its gas transportation contract with Transportadora de Gas del Norte S.A. (TGN), and initiated arbitration seeking relief from the obligation to pay the firm tariff under ESSAs gas transportation contracts with Gasoducto GasAndes (Argentina) S.A. (GasAndes Argentina) and Gasoducto GasAndes S.A. (GasAndes Chile) or in the alternative, termination of such contracts. TGN (which later filed a lawsuit against ESSA in Argentina), GasAndes Argentina, and GasAndes Chile disputed that the restrictions on the export of gas justified the adjustment or termination of the respective gas transportation contracts and sought due tariff payments. On December 29, 2010, ESSA reached settlement agreements with GasAndes Argentina, GasAndes Chile, and TGN terminating the respective gas transportation contracts and resolving all pending legal disputes and potential future claims. ESSA recognized approximately $72 million as other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2010 related to the settlement agreements. Upon termination of the TGN gas transportation contract, ESSA is no longer required to pay certain charges imposed by the Argentine Republic relating to gas supply infrastructure. In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina, Alaska, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, claiming that the defendants alleged GHG emissions have contributed to alleged global warming which, in turn, allegedly has led to the erosion of the plaintiffs alleged land. The plaintiffs assert nuisance and concert of action claims against the Company and the other defendants, and a conspiracy claim against a subset of the other defendants. The plaintiffs seek to recover relocation costs, indicated in the complaint to be from $95 million to $400 million, and other unspecified damages from the defendants. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the District Court granted in October 2009. The plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The parties have briefed the appeal and are awaiting a date for oral argument. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July, 1993 the Public Attorneys office filed a claim against Eletropaulo, the Sao Paulo State Government, SABESP (a state owned company), CETESB (a state owned company) and DAEE (the municipal Water and Electric Energy Department) alleging that they were liable for pollution of the Billings Reservoir as a result of pumping water from the Pinheiros River into the Billings Reservoir. The events in question occurred while Eletropaulo was a state owned company. An initial lower court decision in 2007 found the parties liable for the payment of approximately R$670 million ($401 million) for remediation. Eletropaulo subsequently appealed the decision to the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo which reversed the lower court decision. In 2009, the Public Attorneys Office has filed appeals to both Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) and the Supreme Court (SC) and such appeals were answered by Eletropaulo in the fourth quarter of 2009. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 1996, a public civil action was asserted against Eletropaulo and Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Desportiva Cultural Eletropaulo (the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o) relating to alleged environmental damage caused by construction of the 103 Table of Contents Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o near Guarapiranga Reservoir. The initial decision that was upheld by the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo in 2006 found that Eletropaulo should repair the alleged environmental damage by demolishing certain construction and reforesting the area, and either sponsor an environmental project which would cost approximately R$1 million ($599 thousand) as of December 31, 2010, or pay an indemnification amount of approximately R$10.2 million ($6 million). Eletropaulo has appealed this decision to the Supreme Court and is awaiting a decision. In February 2009, a CAA Section 114 information request from the EPA regarding Cayuga and Somerset was received. The request seeks various operating and testing data and other information regarding certain types of projects at the Cayuga and Somerset facilities, generally for the time period from January 1, 2000 through the date of the information request. This type of information request has been used in the past to assist the EPA in determining whether a plant is in compliance with applicable standards under the CAA. Cayuga and Somerset responded to the EPAs information request in June 2009, and they are awaiting a response from the EPA regarding their submittal. At this time, it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this request may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position. On February 2, 2009, the Cayuga facility received a Notice of Violation from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) that the facility had exceeded the permitted volume limit of coal ash that can be disposed of in the on site landfill. Cayuga has met with NYSDEC and submitted a Landfill Liner Demonstration Report to them. Such report found that the landfill has adequate engineering integrity to support the additional coal ash and there is no inherent environmental threat. NYSDEC has indicated they accept the finding of the report. A permit modification was approved by the NYSDEC on May 14, 2010 and such permit modification allows for closure of this approximately 10 acre portion of the landfill. The construction in accordance with the approved permit modification was completed in November 2010 and the certification report for this construction project is currently being drafted to submit to the NYSDEC in the second quarter of 2011. While at this time it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this matter may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position, based upon the discussions to date, the Company does not believe the impact will be material. In March 2009, AES Uruguaiana Empreendimentos S.A. (AESU) initiated arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against YPF S.A. (YPF) seeking damages and other relief relating to YPFs breach of the parties gas supply agreement (GSA). Thereafter, in April 2009, YPF initiated arbitration in the ICC against AESU and two unrelated parties, Companhia de Gas do Esado do Rio Grande do Sul and Transportador de Gas del Mercosur S.A. (TGM), claiming that AESU wrongfully terminated the GSA and caused the termination of a transportation agreement (TA) between YPF and TGM (YPF Arbitration). YPF seeks an unspecified amount of damages from AESU, a declaration that YPFs performance was excused under the GSA due to certain alleged force majeure events, or, in the alternative, a declaration that the GSA and the TA should be terminated without a finding of liability against YPF because of the allegedly onerous obligations imposed on YPF by those agreements. In addition, in the YPF Arbitration, TGM asserts that if it is determined that AESU is responsible for the termination of the GSA, AESU is liable for TGMs alleged losses, including losses under the TA. The procedural schedules for the arbitrations have been established but the hearing dates have not been scheduled to date. AESU believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit 104 Table of Contents was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. In June 2009, the Inter American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States (IACHR) requested that the Republic of Panama suspend the construction of AES Changuinola S.A.s hydroelectric project (Project) until the bodies of the Inter American human rights system can issue a final decision on a petition (286/08) claiming that the construction violates the human rights of alleged indigenous communities. In July 2009, Panama responded by informing the IACHR that it would not suspend construction of the Project and requesting that the IACHR revoke its request. In June 2010, the Inter American Court of Human Rights vacated the IACHRs request. With respect to the merits of the underlying petition, the IACHR heard arguments by the communities and Panama in November 2009, but has not issued a decision to date. The Company cannot predict Panamas response to any determination on the merits of the petition by the bodies of the Inter American human rights system. In July 2009, AES Energ&iacute;a Cartagena S.R.L. (AES Cartagena) received notices from the Spanish national energy regulator, Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de Energ&iacute;a (CNE), stating that the proceeds of the sale of electricity from AES Cartagenas plant should be reduced by roughly the value of the CO2 allowances that were granted to AES Cartagena for free for the years 2007, 2008, and the first half of 2009. In particular, the notices stated that CNE intended to invoice AES Cartagena to recover that value, which CNE calculated as approximately 20 million ($27 million) for 2007 2008 and an amount to be determined for the first half of 2009. In September 2009, AES Cartagena received invoices for 523,548 (approximately $694,000) for the allowances granted for free for 2007 and 19,907,248 (approximately $26 million) for 2008. In July 2010, AES Cartagena received an invoice for approximately 5.4 million ($7 million) for the allowances granted for free for the first half of 2009. AES Cartagena does not expect to be charged for CO2 allowances issued free of charge for subsequent periods. AES Cartagena has paid the amounts invoiced and has filed challenges to the CNEs demands in the Spanish judicial system. There can be no assurances that the challenges will be successful. AES Cartagena has demanded indemnification from its fuel supply and electricity toller, GDF Suez, in relation to the CNE invoices under the long term energy agreement (the Energy Agreement) with GDF Suez. However, GDF Suez has disputed that it is responsible for the CNE invoices under the Energy Agreement. Therefore, in September 2009, AES Cartagena initiated arbitration against GDF Suez, seeking to recover the payments made to CNE. In the arbitration, AES Cartagena also seeks a determination that GDF Suez is responsible for procuring and bearing the cost of CO2 allowances that are required to offset the CO2 emissions of AES Cartagenas power plant, which is also in dispute between the parties. To date, AES Cartagena has paid approximately 20 million ($27 million) for the CO2 allowances that have been required to offset 2008 and 2009 CO2 emissions. AES Cartagena expects that allowances will need to be purchased to offset emissions for subsequent years. The evidentiary hearing in the arbitration took place from May 31 June 4, 2010, and closing arguments were heard on September 1, 2010. In February 2011, the arbitral tribunal requested further briefing from the parties on certain issues in the arbitration. If AES Cartagena does not prevail in the arbitration and is required to bear the cost of carbon compliance, its results of operations could be materially adversely affected and, in turn, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company and its results of operations. AES Cartagena believes it has meritorious claims and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 2009, the Public Defenders Office of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (PDO) filed a class action against AES Sul in the 16th District Court of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (District Court), claiming that AES Sul has been illegally passing PIS and COFINS taxes (taxes based on AES Suls income) to consumers. According to ANEELs Order No. 93/05, the federal laws of Brazil, and the Brazilian Constitution, energy companies such as AES Sul are entitled to highlight PIS and COFINS taxes in power bills to final consumers, as the cost of those taxes is included in the energy tariffs that are applicable to final consumers. Before AES Sul had 105 Table of Contents been served with the action, the District Court dismissed the lawsuit in October 2009 on the ground that AES Sul had been properly highlighting PIS and COFINS taxes in consumer bills in accordance with Brazilian law. In April 2010, the PDO appealed to the Appellate Court of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (AC). In November 2010, the AC affirmed the dismissal. The PDO is expected to appeal. If the dismissal is ever reversed and AES Sul does not prevail in the lawsuit and is ordered to cease recovering PIS and COFINS taxes pursuant to its energy tariff, its potential prospective losses could be approximately R$9.6 million ($6 million) per month, as estimated by AES Sul. In addition, if AES Sul is ordered to reimburse consumers, its potential retrospective liability could be approximately R$1.2 billion ($718 million), as estimated by AES Sul. AES Sul believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings if it is served with the action; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in its efforts. Furthermore, if AES Sul does not prevail in the litigation it will seek to adjust its energy tariff to compensate it for its losses, but there can be no assurances that it would be successful in obtaining an adjusted energy tariff. In October 2009, IPL received a Notice of Violation (NOV) and Finding of Violation from EPA pursuant to CAA Section 113(a). The NOV alleges violations of the CAA at IPLs three coal fired electric generating facilities dating back to 1986. The alleged violations primarily pertain to EPAs Prevention of Significant Deterioration and nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) requirements under the CAA. Since receiving the letter, IPL management has met with EPA staff and is currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of similar cases have required companies to pay civil penalties and to install additional pollution control technology on coal fired electric generating units. A similar outcome in this case could have a material impact to IPL and could, in turn, have a material impact on the Company. IPL would seek recovery through customer rates of any operating or capital expenditures related to pollution control technology systems to reduce regulated air emissions; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in that regard. In November 2009, April 2010 and December 2010, substantially similar personal injury lawsuits were filed by a total of 26 residents and estates in the Dominican Republic against the Company, AES Atlantis, Inc., AES Puerto Rico, LP, AES Puerto Rico, Inc., and AES Puerto Rico Services, Inc., in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware. In each lawsuit the plaintiffs allege that the coal combustion byproducts of AES Puerto Ricos power plant were illegally placed in the Dominican Republic in October 2003 through March 2004 and subsequently caused the plaintiffs birth defects, other personal injuries, and or deaths. The plaintiffs do not quantify their alleged damages, but generally allege that they are entitled to compensatory and punitive damages. The AES defendants have moved for partial dismissal of both the November 2009 and April 2010 lawsuits on various grounds. (The AES Defendants have until mid February to respond to the December 2010 lawsuit.) In September 2010, the Superior Court heard arguments on the motions. The Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs fraud allegations without prejudice to replead, and the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in November 2010. The AES defendants have filed a renewed motion to dismiss the amended issues. The remaining claims (other than fraud) addressed in the AES defendants original motion to dismiss are still pending. The AES defendants believe they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. On December 21, 2010, AES 3C Maritza East 1 EOOD, which owns an unfinished 670MW lignite fired power plant in Bulgaria, made the first in a series of demands on the performance bond securing the construction Contractors obligations under the parties EPC Contract. The Contractor failed to complete the plant on schedule. The total amount demanded by Maritza under the performance bond is approximately 155 million ($205 million). However, the Contractor obtained a temporary injunction from a French court preventing the issuing bank from honoring the bond demands. As the performance bond is governed by English law, Maritza obtained a judgment from an English court that the bond should be paid, and then presented this judgment to the French court which issued the temporary injunction. However, on February 10, 2011, the French court issued a decision enjoining the issuing bank from honoring the demands on the performance bond pending the determination of the arbitration between Maritza and the Contractor, described below. Maritza is attempting to 106 Table of Contents lift that injunction or otherwise obtain payment on its demands. In addition, in December 2010, the Contractor issued a notice of dispute alleging that the lignite that has been supplied by Maritza for commissioning of the power plant is out of specification, allegedly entitling the Contractor to an extension of time to complete the power plant, an increase to the contract price of approximately 62 million ($82 million), and other relief. The Contractor thereafter advised Maritza that it had stopped commissioning of the power plants two units because of the characteristics of the lignite supplied, and, in January 2011, initiated arbitration on its lignite claim. Maritza disputes that the lignite is out of specification and intends to defend the arbitration and assert counterclaims for delay liquidated damages and other relief relating to the Contractors failure to complete the power plant and other breaches of the EPC contract. Maritza believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. ITEM 4. REMOVED AND RESERVED 107 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On March 12, 2010, the Company and Terrific Investment Corporation (Investor), a wholly owned subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, entered into a stockholder agreement (the Stockholder Agreement) in connection with the agreement discussed in the following paragraph. Under the Stockholder Agreement, as long as Investor holds more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, Investor will have the right to designate one nominee, who must be reasonably acceptable to the Board, for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. Investor has not designated its nominee for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, until such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock, Investor has agreed to vote its shares in accordance with the recommendation of the Company on any matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company relating to the election of directors and compensation matters. Otherwise, Investor may vote its shares at its discretion. Further, under the Stockholder Agreement, Investor will be subject to a standstill restriction which generally prohibits Investor from purchasing additional securities of the Company beyond the level acquired by it under the stock purchase agreement entered into between Investor and the Company on November 6, 2009. In addition, Investor has agreed to a lock up restriction such that Investor would not sell its shares for a period of 12 months following the closing, subject to certain exceptions. The standstill and lock up restrictions also terminate at such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock. Investor will have certain registration rights and preemptive rights under the Stockholder Agreement with respect to its shares of common stock of the Company. On March 15, 2010, the Company completed the sale of 125,468,788 shares of common stock to Investor. The shares were sold for $12.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.58 billion. Investors ownership in the Companys common stock is now approximately 15% of the Companys total outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers In July 2010, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $500 million of AES common stock. The Board authorization permits the Company to repurchase stock through a variety of methods, including open market repurchases and or privately negotiated transactions. The original authorization was set to expire on December 31, 2010, however; in December 2010, the Board authorized an extension of the stock repurchase program. There can be no assurance as to the amount, timing or prices of repurchases, which may vary based on market conditions and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2010, shares of common stock repurchased under this plan totaled 8,382,825 at a total cost of $99 million plus a nominal amount of commissions (average of $11.86 per share including commissions). There was $401 million remaining under the stock repurchase program available for future repurchases at December 31, 2010. 108 Table of Contents The following table presents information regarding purchases made by The AES Corporation of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2010: Repurchase Period Total Numberof SharesPurchased Average PricePaid per Share Total Number of SharesRepurchased as Partof a Publicly AnnouncedRepurchase Plan Dollar Value of MaximumNumber of Shares To BePurchased Under the Plan 10/1/10 10/31/10 6,086,345 $ 12.30 6,086,345 $ 409,713,649 11/1/10 11/30/10 $ $ 409,713,649 12/1/10 12/31/10 755,000 $ 11.89 755,000 $ 400,732,931 Total 6,841,345 $ 12.26 6,841,345 Market Information Our common stock is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol AES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business We are a global power company. We operate two primary lines of business. The first is our Generation business, where we own and or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities, other intermediaries and certain end users. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our Generation and Utilities businesses comprised approximately 45% and 55% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We are also continuing to expand our wind and solar generation businesses. These initiatives are not material contributors to our operating results at this time, but we believe that certain of these initiatives may become material in the future. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10 K. Our Organization and Segments. Our management reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively EMEA), each managed by a regional president. The financial reporting segment structure uses our management reporting structure as its foundation and reflects how we manage the business internally. Based on our application of the segment reporting accounting guidance, which provides certain quantitative thresholds and aggregation criteria, we have concluded that the Company has the following six reportable segments: Latin America Generation; Latin America Utilities; North America Generation; North America Utilities; Europe Generation; Asia Generation. We report the Companys Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation, Wind Generation and Climate Solutions operating segments within Corporate and Other because they do not meet the criteria to allow for aggregation with another operating segment or the quantitative thresholds that would require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. None of these operating segments are currently material to our financial statement presentation of reportable segments, individually or in the aggregate. Corporate and Other also includes corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments and other intercompany charges such as self insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company modified its internal reporting structure to move the management of the Companys generation business in Jordan, Amman East, from Asia to Europe. Accordingly, Amman East is now reported within the Europe Generation segment. All prior periods have been retrospectively restated to reflect this change and conform to current period presentation. Key Drivers of Our Results of Operations. Our Generation and Utilities businesses are distinguished by the nature of their customers, operational differences, cost structure, regulatory environment and risk exposure. As a result, each line of business has slightly different drivers which affect operating results. Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other things, plant reliability and efficiency, power prices, volume, 113 Table of Contents management of fixed and variable operating costs, management of working capital including collection of receivables, and the extent to which our plants have hedged their exposure to currency and commodities such as fuel. For our Generation businesses which sell power under short term contracts or in the spot market, the most crucial factors are the current market price of electricity and the marginal costs of production. Growth in our Generation business is largely tied to securing new PPAs, expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building or acquiring new power plants. Performance drivers for our Utilities businesses include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; management of working capital, including collection of receivables; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive regulatory requirements; and in developing countries, reduction of commercial and technical losses. The operating results of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth and weather conditions in areas in which they operate. In addition to these drivers, as further explained below, the Company also has exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. One of the key factors which affect our Generation business is our ability to enter into contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of fuel used to produce that electricity. Long term contracts are intended to reduce exposure to volatility associated with fuel prices in the market and the price of electricity by fixing the revenue and costs for these businesses. The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. In turn, most of these businesses enter into long term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. While these long term contractual agreements reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel, the predictability of operating results and cash flows vary by business based on the extent to which a facilitys generation capacity and fuel requirements are contracted and the negotiated terms of these agreements. Entering into these contracts exposes us to counterparty credit risk. For further discussion of these risks, see Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. When fuel costs increase, many of our businesses are able to pass these costs on to their customers. Generation businesses with long term contracts in place do this by including fuel pass through or fuel indexing arrangements in their contracts. Utilities businesses can pass costs on to their customers through increases in current or future tariff rates. Therefore, in a rising fuel cost environment, the increased fuel costs for these businesses often result in an increase in revenue to the extent these costs can be passed through (though not necessarily on a one for one basis). Conversely, in a declining fuel cost environment, the decreased fuel costs can result in a decrease in revenue. Increases or decreases in revenue at these businesses that have the ability to pass through costs to the customer have a corresponding impact on cost of sales, to the extent the costs can be passed through, resulting in a limited impact on gross margin, if any. Although these circumstances may not have a large impact on gross margin, they can significantly affect gross margin as a percentage of revenue. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of revenue is a less relevant measure when evaluating our operating performance. To the extent our businesses are unable to pass through fuel cost increases to their customers, gross margin may be adversely affected. Global diversification also helps us mitigate risk. Our presence in mature markets helps mitigate the exposure associated with our businesses in emerging markets. Additionally, our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, water (hydroelectric power), wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. However, to the extent the mix of fuel sources enabling our generation capabilities in any one market is not diversified, the spread in costs of different fuels or the availability of natural resources such as water for hydroelectric power production or wind may also influence the operating performance and the ability of our subsidiaries to compete within that market. For example, in a market where gas prices fall to a low level compared to coal prices, power prices may be set by low gas prices which can affect the profitability of our coal plants in that market. In certain cases, we may attempt to hedge fuel prices to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, we only hedge a 114 Table of Contents portion of our currency and commodity risks, and our businesses are still subject to these risks, as further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. Commodity and power price volatility could continue to impact our financial metrics to the extent this volatility is not hedged. For a discussion of our sensitivities to commodity, currency and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Form 10 K. Due to our global presence, the Company has significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure is primarily associated with the impact of the translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results from their local currency to U.S. Dollars that is required for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, there is foreign currency transaction exposure when an entity enters into transactions, including debt agreements, in currencies other than their functional currency. These risks are further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. During 2010, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a significant impact on our operating results. If the current foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues, our gross margin and other financial metrics could continue to be affected. Another key driver of our results is our ability to bring new businesses into commercial operation successfully. We currently have approximately 1,300 MW of projects under construction in eight countries. Our prospects for improved operating results and cash flows are dependent upon successful completion of these projects on time and within budget. However, as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties, construction is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with site identification, financing, permitting and our ability to meet construction deadlines. Delays or the inability to complete projects and commence commercial operations can result in increased costs, impairment of assets and other challenges involving partners and counterparties to our construction agreements, PPAs and other agreements. Our gross margin is also impacted by the fact that in each country in which we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity, and environmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business. Regulations differ on a country by country basis (and even at the state and local municipality levels) and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country, and affect many aspects of our operations and development projects. Our ability to negotiate tariffs, enter into long term contracts, pass through costs related to capital expenditures and otherwise navigate these regulations can have an impact on our revenue, costs and gross margin. Environmental and land use regulations, including existing and proposed regulation of GHG emissions, could substantially increase our capital expenditures or other compliance costs, which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. For a further discussion of the Regulatory Environment, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments Environmental, included in Item 8. Financial Statements, Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated with Government Regulation and Laws of this Form 10 K. Key Drivers of Results in 2010 In 2010, the Companys gross margin and cash flow from operations increased $531 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, while net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million compared to the prior year. During 2010, our North American generation businesses continued to face challenges associated with relatively lower gas prices and a decline in power prices relative to coal and other fuel. In particular, lower gas and power prices have affected the generation volume and financial results of our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas which are merchant businesses and not subject to PPAs. We expect 115 Table of Contents this trend to continue. In 2010, these challenges were partially mitigated by hedging arrangements. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Impairments below. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Despite these challenges, many of our financial measures have improved when compared to 2009. Gross margin increased due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation caused by a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies in 2010 and better operating performance at certain businesses. For instance, certain of the Companys Latin American businesses experienced continued increases in market demand due to the local economic recovery in Latin America. The Company also benefited from higher demand and favorable market conditions at Masinloc, our generation business in the Philippines. Masinlocs higher availability enabled the Company to benefit from increased contract and spot market sales and favorable market prices in the Philippines. In addition, cash provided by operating activities increased due to the improved operating results at Latin America generation businesses and Masinloc; contributions from the consolidation of Cartagena and the Ballylumford acquisition in 2010; and changes in working capital in Latin America. Despite the increase in gross margin in 2010, net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased primarily from the impact of long lived asset impairments recognized related to four businesses: Eastern Energy in New York, Southland in California, Tisza II in Hungary and Deepwater in Texas. These were partially offset by gains from the sale of our discontinued businesses in Oman and Qatar and a decrease in goodwill impairment charges. In 2011, we expect to face continued challenges in our business, including the trends in North America described above. In addition, the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and commodity prices on our operations may continue into 2011. In 2011, the components of the tariff reset in Brazil and its potential impact on our Brazilian utilities are uncertain at this time and we expect continued challenges in our merchant businesses such as those in the U.S., Hungary and Northern Ireland. However, management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses and growth from new businesses acquired, that commenced operations in 2010 or are expected to commence operations in 2011, may lessen or offset the impact of these challenges described above, as they did in 2010. However, if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described above or elsewhere in this section impact us more than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our gross margin and net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In addition, we do not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. Such cash flows may be influenced by the operating challenges presented above and will also not include the cash flows from operations which were sold in 2010 or the increases experienced from the cash flows provided by the initial consolidation of Cartagena, the acquisition of Ballylumford and several working capital transactions at our Latin American utilities in 2010 as discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity. The following briefly describes the key changes in our reported revenue, gross margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, Adjusted Earnings per Share (a non GAAP measure) and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Results of Operations and Segment Analysis discussion within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. 116 Table of Contents Performance Highlights Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 Gross Margin $ 3,964 $ 3,433 $ 3,568 Net Income Attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share from Continuing Operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (a non GAAP measure)(1) $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 3,510 $ 2,202 $ 2,160 (1) See reconciliation and definition below under Non GAAP Measure. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue increased $2.7 billion, or 19%, to $16.6 billion in 2010 compared with $14.0 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $805 million; increased volume and rates at our Brazilian utilities attributable to increased demand due to the recovery of the local economy and the favorable impact of the June 2009 tariff reset; the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010; the favorable impact of rates at our generation businesses in Argentina; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; higher demand at Gener in Chile; the impact of the Companys new business in Northern Ireland, acquired in August 2010; and higher demand and rates at Indianapolis Power and Light. Gross margin increased $531 million, or 15%, to $4.0 billion in 2010 compared with $3.4 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $219 million; an increase in demand at our generation and utilities businesses in Latin America; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; and the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs in Latin America, largely driven by bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil in 2009 that did not recur; and lower rates at our generation businesses in New York. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million to $9 million in 2010, compared to $658 million in 2009. Key drivers of the decrease included: Impairment losses in New York related to our Eastern Energy facilities, in California related to our Southland (Huntington Beach) generation facility, in Hungary related to our Tisza II generation facility and in Texas related to our Deepwater facility; 117 Table of Contents A decrease in gain on sale of investments due to the sale of our businesses in Northern Kazakhstan which occurred in 2009; and A decrease in other income due to the reduction in interest and penalties in 2009 associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the Programa de Recuperacao Fiscal (REFIS) program and a favorable court decision in 2009 enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by: The gain on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of Barka which occurred in August 2010; An increase in net equity in earnings of affiliates partially offset by income tax expense related to the sale of the Companys indirect investment in Companhia Energ&eacute;tica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Lower impairment expenses related to a goodwill impairment of our business in Kilroot that occurred in 2009; Lower income tax expense due to 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries; and An increase in gross margin as described above. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion, or 59%, to $3.5 billion in 2010 compared with $2.2 billion in 2009. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $837 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased tax payments in 2009 associated with a tax amnesty program of $326 million, higher working capital requirements during 2009 related to payments on the settlement of swap agreements of $65 million and in 2010, a $50 million decrease in employer contributions to pension plans and lower payments for contingencies; an increase of $215 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to the higher gross margin in 2010 combined with improved working capital mainly as a result of higher collections of value added taxes and accounts receivable; an increase of $99 million at Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher gross margin; and an increase of $58 million as a result of our consolidation of Cartagena in 2010 and the acquisition of Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $136 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations of businesses sold in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of businesses sold was $33 million and will not recur in 2011. In 2010 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities at our Latin American Utilities businesses included several items such as the tax amnesty program and settlement of swap agreements, as described above, that are not expected to recur. In addition, 2010 net cash provided by operating activities benefited from the one time cash savings related to the utilization of tax credits received as a result of the REFIS program. As such, the Company does not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. 118 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue decreased $1.2 billion, or 8%, to $14.0 billion in 2009 compared with $15.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $997 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; decreases in volume at Uruguaiana due to the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold, as well as in New York and Hungary and lower dispatch in Northern Ireland due to unfavorable gas prices compared to coal; the impact of lower spot and contract energy prices at our generation business in Chile; and lower energy prices and volume at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase in tariff rates at our utilities businesses in Latin America primarily reflecting the recovery of energy purchases that were passed through to our customers. Gross margin decreased $135 million, or 4%, to $3.4 billion in 2009 compared with $3.6 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $218 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; lower energy prices and higher purchased energy costs at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic and Argentina; increased pension costs in Brazil and the U.S.; and lower volume in New York due to lower spot market rates. These decreases were partially offset by: improved operating performance at our generation businesses in Chile and the Philippines; higher tariffs in Brazil and El Salvador; and bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $576 million to $658 million in 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: a gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Northern Kazakhstan partially offset by a performance incentive bonus recognized in 2009 for management services provided to these subsidiaries and a settlement upon termination of the management agreement in 2009; the reduction in gross margin in 2009 as described above; and higher impairment expenses in 2009 as a result of an impairment of goodwill at Kilroot in Northern Ireland, and an impairment recognized on our assets in Pakistan which is reflected in discontinued operations, offset by a decline in long lived asset impairment compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by: a reduction in foreign currency transaction losses on net monetary position as a result of reduced losses at our businesses in Chile and the Philippines; a reduction in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates and debt balances in Brazil and favorable foreign currency translation; and lower income tax expenses driven in part by lower pre tax income and a decrease in the effective tax rate from 29% in 2008 to 26% in 2009 due, in part, to tax benefits recorded in 2009 upon the release of 119 Table of Contents valuation allowances at U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recognized in Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. In 2008, the $905 million gain recognized on the sale of our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses had a significant impact on net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In 2009, the Company recognized a performance incentive bonus of $80 million in the first quarter for management services provided to these sold businesses, reflected as other income. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized an additional gain on the sale of the businesses of $98.5 million upon the termination of the management agreement. While the Company engages in the sale of assets and businesses from time to time, the gain or loss recognized in any such sale will depend on a number of factors related to the asset or business that may be sold. Therefore, the Company does not believe that the decline in net income between 2008 and 2009 represents a trend. All of the amounts related to our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses were reported in continuing operations and will not recur in 2010 or future years. Net cash from operating activities increased $42 million, or 2%, to $2.2 billion in 2009 compared with $2.2 billion in 2008. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $238 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to improved working capital management; an increase of $148 million at our Asia Generation businesses due to improved working capital management and improved gross margin; and an increase of $115 million at our Europe Generation businesses primarily due to the collection of the $80 million Kazakhstan management performance incentive bonus in the first quarter 2009. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $391 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased working capital requirements, including the payment of the settlement of a swap agreement, increased tax payments associated with a tax amnesty program and increased payments related to the settlement of contingencies and energy purchases, partially offset by increased operating results; and a decrease of $77 million at our North America Generation businesses, primarily due to reduced operating results. Non GAAP Measure We define adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) mark to market amounts related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) significant gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) significant losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. AES believes that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Companys internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to mark to market gains or losses related to derivative transactions, currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.11 per share. For purposes of measuring loss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be antidilutive. However, for purposes of computing Adjusted 120 Table of Contents EPS (a non GAAP measure), the Company has included the impact of dilutive common stock equivalents as the inclusion of the defined adjustments result in income for Adjusted EPS. The table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in GAAP diluted earnings per share to the weighted average shares used in calculating the non GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Reconciliation of Denominator used for Adjusted Earnings Per Share Loss Shares $ per Share GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Loss from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders $ (86 ) 769 $ (0.11 ) EFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES Stock options 2 Restricted stock units 3 NON GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE $ (86 ) 774 $ (0.11 ) Year Ended December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share 2010 2009 2008 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Derivative mark to market (gains) losses(1) (0.01 ) 0.02 0.05 Currency transaction (gains) losses(2) (0.04 ) (0.04 ) 0.17 Disposition/acquisition (gains) losses (3) (0.19 )(4) (1.27 )(5) Impairment losses 1.07 (6) 0.21 (7) 0.13 (8) Debt retirement (gains) losses 0.03 (9) 0.25 (10) Adjusted earnings per share $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 (1) Derivative mark to market (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (2) Unrealized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (3) The Company has not adjusted for the gain or the related tax effect from the sale of its indirect investment in CEMIG, disclosed in Note 7 Investments in and Advances to Affiliates, in its determination of Adjusted EPS because the gain was recognized by an equity method investee. The Company does not adjust for transactions of its equity method investees in its determination of adjusted EPS. (4) Amount includes: Kazakhstan gain of $98 million, or $0.15 per share, related to the termination of a management agreement as well as a gain of $13 million, or $0.02 per share, related to the reversal of a withholding tax contingency. In addition, there was a gain on sale associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China of $14 million, or $0.02 per share. There were no taxes associated with any of these transactions. (5) Amount includes: Net gain on Kazakhstan sale of $905 million, or $1.31 per share, and net loss on sale of subsidiary interests in Gener of $31 million, or $0.04 per share. There was no income tax impact associated with these transactions. (6) Amount primarily includes asset impairments at Eastern Energy of $827 million, Southland (Huntington Beach) of $200 million, Tisza of $85 million, and Deepwater of $79 million ($537 million, or $0.69 per share, $130 million, or $0.17 per share, $69 million, or $0.09 per share, and $51 million, or $0.07 per share, net of income tax, respectively) and goodwill impairment at Deepwater of $18 million (or $0.02 per share, with no income tax impact). (7) Amount includes: Goodwill impairments at Kilroot of $118 million, or $0.18 per share, and in the Ukraine of $4 million, or $0.01 per share; write off of development project costs in Latin America and Asia of $19 million ($11 million net of noncontrolling interests, or $0.01 per share) and an impairment of $10 million, or $0.01 per share, of the Companys investment in a company developing blue gas (coal to gas) technology. There was no income tax impact associated with any of these transactions. 121 Table of Contents (8) Amount includes: Impairment charges primarily associated with development projects in North America of $75 million ($34 million net of noncontrolling interests and income tax, or $0.06 per share); Uruguaiana asset write down of $36 million ($17 million net of noncontrolling interest, or $0.02 per share); South Africa peaker development cost write off of $31 million ($28 million net of income tax, or $0.04 per share) and a nontaxable impairment of the Companys investment in blue gas (coal to gas) technology of $10 million, or $0.01 per share. Impairment losses are net of an income tax benefit of $0.02 per share in 2008. (9) Amount includes loss on retirement of debt at the Parent Company of $15 million, at Andres of $10 million, and at Itabo of $8 million ($10 million, or $0.01 per share, net of income tax at the Parent Company, $0.01 per share at Andres, and $4 million, or $0.01 per share, net of noncontrolling interest at Itabo). (10) Amount includes: $55 million ($34 million net of income tax, or $0.05 per share) loss on the retirement of Parent Company debt; $131 million, or $0.19 per share, which represented the tax impact on the repatriation of a portion of the Kazakhstan sale proceeds that were used to fund the early retirement of Parent Company debt; and $14 million ($9 million net of income tax, or $0.01 per share) of debt refinancing at IPALCO. Debt retirement (gains) losses are net of an income tax benefit of $0.04 per share in 2008. Managements Priorities Management continues to focus on the following priorities: Execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy including funds received in 2010 from asset and equity sales: investing in value accretive projects; delevering to increase financial flexibility, reduce risk and to create future borrowing capacity; and executing its stock repurchase program; from July through December 2010 we have repurchased a total of $99 million, or approximately 8.4 million shares of AES common stock, at an average price per share of $11.86, including commissions. Improvement of operations in the existing portfolio; Achieve cost savings through the alignment of overhead costs with business requirements, systems automation and optimal allocation of business development spending; Strategic portfolio management of existing projects including restructuring and potential sales of certain North American generation subsidiaries; Completion of an approximately 1,300 MW active construction program on time and within budget; Achieving commercial operation at Maritza in Bulgaria. At the end of 2010, the Company experienced certain commissioning delays, as further described in Key Trends and Uncertainties Development below; and 122 Table of Contents Integration of new projects. During 2010, the following projects were acquired or commenced commercial operations: Project Location Fuel GrossMW AES Equity Interest(Percent, Rounded) Ballylumford United Kingdom Gas 1,246 100 % JHRH(1) China Hydro 379 35 % Nueva Ventanas Chile Coal 272 71 % St. Nikola Bulgaria Wind 156 89 % Guacolda 4(2) Chile Coal 152 35 % Dong Qi(3) China Wind 49 49 % Huanghua II(3) China Wind 49 49 % St. Patrick France Wind 35 100 % North Rhins Scotland Wind 22 100 % Kepezkaya Turkey Hydro 28 51 % Damlapinar(4) Turkey Hydro 16 51 % (1) Jianghe Rural Electrification Development Co.

Acquisition of 35% ownership was completed in June 2010 and the transfer of the remaining 14% ownership, which is subject to approval by the Chinese government, is expected to be completed in May 2011. (2) Guacolda is an equity method investment indirectly held by AES through Gener. The AES equity interest reflects the 29% noncontrolling interests in Gener. (3) Joint venture with Guohua Energy Investment Co. Ltd. (4) Joint Venture with I.C. Energy. Key Trends and Uncertainties Our operations continue to face many risks as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Some of these challenges are also described above in Key Drivers of Results in 2010. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. Development. During the past year, the Company has successfully acquired and completed construction of a number of projects, totaling approximately 2,404 MW, including the acquisition of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom and completion of construction of a number of projects in Europe, Chile and China. However, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties of this Form 10 K, our development projects are subject to uncertainties. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not yet begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, we believe that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this time frame. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results or financial position. Global Economic Conditions. During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Although the economic conditions in several of these countries have improved in recent months, our businesses could be impacted in the event these recent trends do not continue. 123 Table of Contents Our business or results of operations could be impacted if our subsidiaries are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all, are unable to raise funds through the sale of assets or are otherwise unable to finance or refinance their activities. The Company could also be adversely affected if capital market disruptions result in increased borrowing costs (including with respect to interest payments on the Companys or our subsidiaries variable rate debt) or if commodity prices affect the profitability of our plants or their ability to continue operations. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if general economic or political conditions in the markets where our subsidiaries operate deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the availability and or an increase in the cost of capital, or if the value of our assets remain depressed or decline further. Any of the foregoing events or a combination thereof could have a material impact on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, financial covenants, and or its credit rating. Our subsidiaries are subject to credit risk, which includes risk related to the ability of counterparties (such as parties to our PPAs, fuel supply agreements, hedging agreements and other contractual arrangements) to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price or to satisfy their financial or other contractual obligations. The Company has not suffered any material effects related to its counterparties during 2010. However, if macroeconomic conditions impact our counterparties, they may be unable to meet their commitments which could result in the loss of favorable contractual positions, which could have a material impact on our business. In addition, during the past year, certain European countries have faced a sovereign debt crisis and it is possible that other nations could be affected. This crisis has resulted in an increased risk of default by governments and the implementation of austerity measures in countries. If the crisis continues, worsens, or spreads, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company. Our businesses may be impacted if they are unable to access the capital markets, face increased taxes or labor costs, or if governments fail to fulfill their obligations to us or adopt austerity measures which adversely impact our projects. In addition, as noted in the Risk Factor entitled, Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges, our renewables businesses are dependent on favorable regulatory incentives, including subsidies, which are provided by sovereign governments. If these subsidies or other incentives are reduced or repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, in whole or in part, this could impact the ability of the affected businesses to continue to grow their operations. For example, the Spanish government recently issued a decree which limits the feed in tariff and number of photovoltaic hours eligible for the tariff, which could adversely impact AES Solar in Spain. For further information on the decree see Item 1. Regulatory Spain of this Form 10 K. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries. For further information on the importance of long term contracts and our counterparty credit risk, see the Risk Factor from this Form 10 K titled, We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. As a result of any of the foregoing events, we may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. The Companys investment in AES Solar, whose primary operations are in Europe, at December 31, 2010 was $312 million. For a discussion of the risks associated with commodity prices, see We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. It is also possible that commodity or power price volatility could continue to impact our financial results. As noted in Key Drivers of Results in 2010, and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk of this Form 10 K, the Companys North American businesses continue to face pressure as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place, but purchase 124 Table of Contents fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. If these conditions continue or worsen, these businesses may need to restructure their obligations or seek additional funding (including from the Parent) or face the possibility that they may be unable to meet their obligations and continue operations. Presently, Eastern Energy, Deepwater and Thames are seeking to restructure their financial obligations and or place certain of their plants in protective layup status to mitigate operating risks caused by high fuel costs and other competitive pressures. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. The Company presently manages its commodity risk with hedging activities to mitigate earnings volatility. However, at present in North America, dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present an opportunity to engage in additional hedging activity for 2011. As a result, there are hedging arrangements in place for only a relatively small portion of 2011. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. Specifically, the operating results of the Companys Eastern Energy generation business in New York could be adversely impacted by continued higher coal prices relative to electricity prices if hedging continues to be uneconomic. If global economic conditions worsen, it could also affect the rates we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our rates based on prevailing market conditions as PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual rate or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. Impairments. Long lived assets. The global economic conditions and other adverse factors discussed above heighten the risk of a significant asset impairment. Examples of conditions that could be indicative of impairment which would require us to evaluate the recovery of a long lived asset or asset group include: current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset group; a significant adverse change in legal factors, including changes in environmental or other regulations or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used or in its physical condition. As further described in Item 1. Regulatory Matters United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR) had the right to require the termination of the long term PPAs under which Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom, supplies electricity to NIE Energy as early as 2010. One of the conditions to the early termination was 180 days notice, which was provided to Kilroot on April 30, 2010. At March 31, 2010, management evaluated Kilroots long lived assets for potential impairment assuming the early termination of the PPA and concluded that no impairment existed at that time. On October 28, 2010, Kilroot received final notice from NIAUR directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the PPA effective November 1, 2010. Kilroot may not be able to replace the contract on competitive terms and, upon cancellation of the PPA effective November 1, 2010, became a merchant plant. It will operate under the gross mandatory pool of the SEM in Northern Ireland. There have been no additional impairment indicators since March 31, 2010. AES Eastern Energy (AEE) operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. 125 Table of Contents The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated an impairment evaluation of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW petroleum coke (pet coke) fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and a recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 126 Table of Contents 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time, since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and what form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations. This was considered as an impairment indicator for the long lived asset groups. The recoverability test of the long lived asset groups indicated that the carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group exceeded its fair value by $200 million which was recognized as an impairment expense. The carrying amounts of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach long lived asset groups were determined to be recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis at September 30, 2010 and no impairment was necessary. During the third quarter of 2010, we also recognized impairment on the long lived assets at our Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. Tisza II operates under an annual contract with an off taker. In the third quarter of 2010, when Tisza II began the negotiation of its 2011 contract, future undiscounted cash flows of the plant were no longer expected to recover the long lived assets groups carrying amount due to prevailing market rates, higher generation costs and lower demand expectations. Accordingly, the Company measured the fair value of the long lived asset group and recorded an impairment expense of $85 million, representing the excess of carrying amount over the fair value at September 30, 2010. Goodwill. The Company seeks business acquisitions as one of its growth strategies. We have achieved significant growth in the past as a result of several business acquisitions, which also resulted in the recognition of goodwill. As noted in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, there is always a risk that Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. The benefits of goodwill are typically realized through the future operating results of an acquired business. Management believes that the recoverability of goodwill is positively correlated with the economic environments in which our acquired businesses operate and a severe economic downturn could negatively impact the recoverability of goodwill. Also, the evolving environmental regulations, including GHG regulations, around the globe continue to increase the operating costs of our generation businesses. In extreme situations, the environmental regulations could even make a once profitable business uneconomical. In addition, most of our generation businesses have a finite life and as the acquired businesses reach the end of their finite lives, the carrying amount of goodwill is gradually recovered through their periodic operating results. The accounting guidance, however, prohibits the systematic amortization of goodwill and rather requires an annual impairment evaluation. Thus, as some of our acquired businesses approach the end of their finite lives, they may incur goodwill impairment charges even if there are no discrete adverse changes in the economic environment. As noted in Long lived assets above, adverse market conditions at Deepwater were also considered an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. Accordingly, in the second and third quarters of 2010, interim 127 Table of Contents goodwill impairment evaluations were performed at the Deepwater reporting unit level. The reporting unit passed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation in the second quarter and no impairment was recognized. In the third quarter, however, the reporting unit failed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation. Upon measurement of impairment loss in Step 2, the entire $18 million goodwill balance was considered impaired and recognized as goodwill impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation and did not have any reporting units that were considered at risk. A reporting unit is considered at risk when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. While there were no potential impairment indicators that could result in the recognition of goodwill impairment for any of these reporting units, it is possible we may incur goodwill impairment on these reporting units in future years if any of the following events occur: a significant adverse change in business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a sale of assets at less than carrying amount, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, an acquisition not performing as expected, changing environmental regulations that significantly increase the cost of doing business, or a business reaches the end of its finite life. The likelihood of the occurrence of these events may increase because of the challenging global macroeconomic conditions. Regulatory Environment. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter and mercury. For a description of material regulations faced by the Company, see Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies and Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows set forth in this Form 10 K. Recent Events Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company continued to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program announced on July 7, 2010. The Company has repurchased 1,026,610 shares at a cost of $13 million in 2011, bringing the cumulative total through February 22, 2010 to 9,409,435 shares at a total cost of $112 million (average price of $11.92 per share including commissions). As of February 25, 2011, $388 million of the $500 million authorized remained available under the stock repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 14 Equity. On February 1, 2011, AES Thames, LLC (Thames), our 208 MW coal fired plant in Connecticut, filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy is due, in part, to the increased cost of energy production. The bankruptcy protection is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or the results of operations. 128 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, Results of operations 2010 2009 2008 $ change2010 vs. 2009 $ change2009 vs. 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: Latin America Generation $ 4,281 $ 3,651 $ 4,468 $ 630 $ (817 ) Latin America Utilities 7,222 6,092 5,907 1,130 185 North America Generation 1,972 1,940 2,234 32 (294 ) North America Utilities 1,145 1,068 1,079 77 (11 ) Europe Generation 1,362 820 1,143 542 (323 ) Asia Generation 618 375 345 243 30 Corporate and Other(1) 1,066 870 1,012 196 (142 ) Eliminations(2) (1,019 ) (862 ) (991 ) (157 ) 129 Total Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 $ 2,693 $ (1,243 ) Gross Margin: Latin America Generation $ 1,497 $ 1,357 $ 1,398 $ 140 $ (41 ) Latin America Utilities 1,072 918 886 154 32 North America Generation 435 477 660 (42 ) (183 ) North America Utilities 249 239 261 10 (22 ) Europe Generation 268 212 273 56 (61 ) Asia Generation 240 93 (10 ) 147 103 Corporate and Other(3) 186 117 62 69 55 Eliminations(4) 17 20 38 (3 ) (18 ) General and administrative expenses (392 ) (339 ) (368 ) (53 ) 29 Interest expense (1,526 ) (1,485 ) (1,770 ) (41 ) 285 Interest income 411 348 519 63 (171 ) Other expense (239 ) (111 ) (161 ) (128 ) 50 Other income 108 465 375 (357 ) 90 Gain on sale of investments 131 909 (131 ) (778 ) Loss on sale of subsidiary stock (31 ) 31 Goodwill impairment (21 ) (122 ) 101 (122 ) Asset impairment expense (1,221 ) (25 ) (175 ) (1,196 ) 150 Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position (33 ) 33 (184 ) (66 ) 217 Other non operating expense (7 ) (12 ) (15 ) 5 3 Income tax expense (307 ) (599 ) (771 ) 292 172 Net equity in earnings of affiliates 183 92 33 91 59 Income from continuing operations 920 1,809 1,929 (889 ) (120 ) Income from operations of discontinued businesses 75 96 97 (21 ) (1 ) Gain (loss) from disposal of discontinued businesses 64 (150 ) 6 214 (156 ) Net income 1,059 1,755 2,032 (696 ) (277 ) Noncontrolling interests: Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,006 ) (1,099 ) (759 ) 93 (340 ) (Income) loss from discontinuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (44 ) 2 (39 ) (46 ) 41 Net income attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 $ (649 ) $ (576 ) Per Share Data: Basic income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.75 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.69 ) Diluted income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.67 ) (1) Corporate and Other includes revenue from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, Wind Generation and other renewables initiatives.

These increases were partially offset by: lower volume sold at Uruguaiana of $53 million as a result of renegotiation of its power sales agreements; lower volume due to unfavorable hydrology in Colombia and Argentina of $41 million; lower contract prices at Gener of $32 million; and lower contract prices on PPAs indexed to international coal prices in the Dominican Republic of $22 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $106 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $34 million, or 3%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher spot prices in Argentina of $69 million; higher volume and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic of $55 million; higher contract prices of $33 million in Colombia; the positive impact of $28 million resulting from the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana, as mentioned above; and higher volume of $23 million in Panama. These increases were partially offset by: higher fuel and purchased energy prices at Gener of $48 million; the net effect of lower PPA prices and higher fuel costs in the Dominican Republic of $38 million; 130 Table of Contents the impact of a reversal of bad debt expense during the first quarter of 2009 of $36 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of one of its power sales agreements; and higher fixed costs of $30 million at Gener primarily due to higher employee costs, increased maintenance expenses and costs incurred due to construction delays at Campiche. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 17% while gross margin increased 10%, primarily due to higher spot purchases and fuel prices at Gener and the reversal of bad debt expense as a result of the renegotiation of one of the power sales agreements at Uruguaiana in the first quarter of 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $181 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $636 million, or 14%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower spot and contract prices of $295 million at Gener; lower volume of $227 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold; and lower energy prices and volume of $174 million in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: and increase of $100 million due to fewer outages at Gener and in Argentina in 2009; and higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $94 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $53 million, or 4%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;; fewer outages of $60 million at Gener and in Argentina; lower diesel consumption, partially offset by higher energy purchases and higher gas consumption, at Gener of $47 million; lower volume of energy purchased at Uruguaiana of $44 million as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements; and the favorable impact of $28 million of a decrease in bad debt expense at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of lower energy prices of $75 million in the Dominican Republic; lower volume and energy prices of $66 million in Argentina; higher purchased energy prices of $48 million at Uruguaiana; and lower spot sales of $48 million at Panama. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 18% while gross margin decreased 3%, primarily due to reduced energy purchases, fewer outages and lower bad debt expense. 131 Table of Contents Latin America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in Latin America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Latin America Utilities Revenue $ 7,222 $ 6,092 $ 5,907 19 % 3 % Gross Margin $ 1,072 $ 918 $ 886 17 % 4 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $697 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2010 increased $433 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $316 million, primarily in Brazil, due to increased market demand; and higher tariffs of $114 million primarily related to the July 2009 tariff reset in Brazil partially offset by the unfavorable impact on rates at Eletropaulo in Brazil of a cumulative adjustment to regulatory liabilities and higher energy prices across our Latin America utility businesses associated with energy purchases passed through to customers of $97 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $107 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $47 million, or 5%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $163 million, primarily in Brazil, due to the increased market demand; and lower contingencies of $142 million in Eletropaulo primarily related to labor contingencies which included a one time reversal, reflecting an agreement with Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o CESP, the pension plan administrator, of $51 million associated with claims for past benefit obligations which will now be accounted for as a component of the pension plan. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $238 million primarily due to the recovery in 2009 of a municipality receivable previously written off in Brazil and higher salaries and other employee related costs, provisions for commercial losses, regulatory penalties and maintenance costs; and $28 million related to the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $442 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2009 increased $627 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $560 million reflecting the recovery of energy purchases of $453 million that were passed through to customers at our utilities in Brazil and El Salvador; and higher volume in Brazil of $62 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $62 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2009 increased $94 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $107 million in El Salvador and Brazil; a $64 million recovery of a municipality receivable previously written off; 132 Table of Contents a non recurring PIS/COFINS fine in 2008 of $33 million; and higher volume of $32 million across the region. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of higher fixed costs of $120 million mainly related to pension expense, labor contingencies and maintenance costs in Brazil.

These increases were partially offset by: a net decrease of $50 million in New York due to lower rates partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a net decrease of $18 million at Deepwater in Texas primarily due to lower volume; and a net decrease of $14 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3 million, generation gross margin for 2010 decreased $45 million, or 9%, from 2009 primarily due to: a net decrease of $94 million in New York due to lower rates and higher coal prices partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a decrease of $16 million at Deepwater due to lower volume and rates; a net decrease of $11 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage; a decrease of $9 million in Hawaii due to an unfavorable impact of mark to market derivatives; and a decrease of $7 million in Puerto Rico due to higher fixed costs. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase of $39 million in New York primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of lower contract and maintenance costs, and other employee related costs; 133 Table of Contents a net increase of $26 million at TEG/TEP due to a current year availability bonus and fewer outages partially offset by higher fuel prices; higher volume of $14 million at Warrior Run due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 2% while gross margin decreased 9%, primarily due to the change in rates in New York having a greater impact on gross margin than revenue. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $44 million, primarily in Mexico, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $250 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $107 million in New York due to a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a decrease of $80 million due to a reduction in natural gas prices at Merida; increased outages of $22 million, $21 million and $17 million at Warrior Run, TEG/TEP and New York, respectively; lower rates of $20 million at Deepwater; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives in New York of $11 million; and the unfavorable impact in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $9 million, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $174 million, or 26%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $72 million in New York driven by a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a $29 million unfavorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments on coal supply contracts in Hawaii as a result of a gain of $22 million in 2008 compared to a loss of $7 million in 2009; an increase in outages of $22 million and $6 million at Warrior Run and in New York, respectively; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives of $11 million and higher emission allowance purchases of $13 million in New York; and the unfavorable impact of $9 million in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 13% while gross margin decreased 28%, primarily due to the increase in coal prices in New York and the unfavorable impact of derivatives in 2009 in Hawaii that had no corresponding impact on revenue. 134 Table of Contents North America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Utilities Revenue $ 1,145 $ 1,068 $ 1,079 7 % 1 % Gross Margin $ 249 $ 239 $ 261 4 % 8 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Utilities revenue for 2010 increased $77 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail demand of $64 million as a result of warmer weather and higher fuel adjustment charges; and increased wholesale revenue of $11 million primarily due to higher prices. Utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $10 million, or 4%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail margin of $20 million due to increased demand; lower pension expense of $12 million; and lower emission allowance expense of $5 million. These increases were partially offset by: increased maintenance expenses of $16 million due to the timing of major generating unit overhauls; and increased fixed costs of $14 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 7% while gross margin increased 4%, primarily due to increased fuel and maintenance costs. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Utilities revenue for 2009 decreased $11 million, or 1%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower retail volume of $31 million due primarily to milder weather and the economic recession; and decreased wholesale revenue of $7 million driven by lower market prices. These decreases were partially offset by: $32 million of voluntary credits IPL provided to retail customers in 2008. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters North America of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these credits. Utilities gross margin for 2009 decreased $22 million, or 8%, from 2008 primarily due to: decreased wholesale margin of $16 million due to unfavorable prices; and increased pension expense of $25 million largely due to the decline in market value of IPLs pension assets during 2008. 135 Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by: increased retail margin of $15 million, primarily due to the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, partially offset by lower retail sales volumes in 2009; and decreased property tax expense of $5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 1% while gross margin decreased 8%, primarily due to the $25 million increase in pension expense and the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, both of which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. Europe Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Europe for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Europe Generation Revenue $ 1,362 $ 820 $ 1,143 66 % 28 % Gross Margin $ 268 $ 212 $ 273 26 % 22 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $41 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $583 million, or 71%, from 2009 primarily due to: $409 million from the adoption of new accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) which resulted in the consolidation of Cartagena in Spain, a generation business previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting; $117 million from the operations of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom, which was acquired in August 2010; $16 million from a full year of combined cycle operations at our Amman East plant in Jordan, which was single cycle until August 2009; higher tariffs of $16 million at Altai in Kazakhstan; higher volume of $15 million at Kilroot in the United Kingdom largely driven by coal pass through and increased demand, partially offset by lower capacity revenue due to the termination of the long term PPA and related supplementary agreements. These increases were partially offset by: lower volume and sales of emissions allowances in Hungary of $16 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $1 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $57 million, or 27%, from 2009 primarily due to: $62 million from the consolidation of Cartagena as discussed above; higher tariffs and lower fixed costs at Altai of $29 million; and $13 million from the operations of Ballylumford since its acquisition. 136 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: lower gross margin of $28 million primarily from the termination of the long term PPA at Kilroot; and lower gross margin of $20 million in Hungary primarily attributable to higher fuel costs that could not be passed through and lower sales of emission allowances. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 66% while gross margin increased 26%, primarily due to the consolidation of Cartagena and acquisition of Ballylumford that have a larger positive impact on revenue than gross margin, and the positive impact of higher energy revenue at Kilroot, which as a pass through had no corresponding impact on gross margin. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $146 million, driven mainly by Kilroot, Hungary and Kazakhstan, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $177 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower revenue of $101 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower volume of $81 million in Hungary due to the combined impact of the cancellation of one of our PPAs and reduced demand; and lower volume of $67 million at Kilroot, a coal fired plant, mainly driven by lower dispatch due to favorable gas prices compared to coal. These decreases were partially offset by: the benefit of new business of $50 million at Amman East, which commenced single cycle operations in July 2008; and higher rates of $15 million in Kazakhstan. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $35 million, driven mainly by Kilroot and Kazakhstan, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $26 million, or 10%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower gross margin of $41 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower demand of $12 million in Hungary; and an overall increase of $22 million in fixed costs across the region. These decreases were partially offset by: higher capacity revenue at Kilroot; higher energy prices in Kazakhstan; and the benefit of new business at Amman East. Asia Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Asia for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Asia Generation Revenue $ 618 $ 375 $ 345 65 % 9 % Gross Margin $ 240 $ 93 $ (10 ) 158 % 1030 % 137 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $28 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $215 million, or 57%, from 2009 primarily due to: favorable generation rates and volume of $210 million at Masinloc in the Philippines as a result of increased market demand and improved plant availability subsequent to the completion of its overhaul at the beginning of 2010; and higher demand from both new and existing contract and spot customers as a result of lower supply shortages in the Philippines power market due to a strong energy growth rate. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $13 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $134 million, or 144%, from 2009 primarily due to a combination of higher availability attributable to improved plant operations, higher market demand and favorable spot prices at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 65% while gross margin increased 158%, primarily due to the positive influence on gross margin due to favorable spot rates and operational efficiencies resulting from the Masinloc plant overhauls in late 2009 and early 2010, which led to higher availability and allowed for more efficient operations that have materially improved the operating results for 2010 as compared to 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $23 million, primarily in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, generation revenue for 2009 increased $53 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: the benefit of $46 million of our new business Masinloc, which was acquired in April 2008; increased revenue of $70 million in 2009 at Masinloc due to improved rates and volume as a result of improved availability and new customer contracts; and $18 million from a one time favorable energy sales settlement at Masinloc. These increases were partially offset by: the decrease in revenue of $71 million at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka primarily due to a decline in fuel costs which are largely passed through to the customer and higher outages in 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by higher capacity revenue. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $6 million, primarily in the Philippines, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $109 million, or 1,090%, from 2008 primarily due to: the impact of our new business at Masinloc of $23 million; a $91 million increase at Masinloc due to higher contract sales, where margins are more favorable than spot sales, lower fuel prices, improved availability and the favorable energy sales settlement described above; and higher capacity revenue at Kelanitissa of $10 million. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $20 million at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue increased 9% while gross margin increased 1,030%, primarily due to higher contract margins at Masinloc as a result of improved operations, availability and lower fuel prices, as well as the larger relative impact on gross margin from the one time favorable energy sales settlement described above. 138 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Corporate and other includes the net operating results from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, AES Wind Generation and renewables projects which are immaterial for the purposes of separate segment disclosure. The following table excludes inter segment activity and summarizes revenue and gross margin for Corporate and Other entities for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Revenue Europe Utilities $ 356 $ 286 $ 403 24 % 29 % Africa Utilities 422 370 379 14 % 2 % Africa Generation 61 65 65 6 % 0 % Wind Generation 202 133 128 52 % 4 % Corp/Other 25 16 37 56 % 57 % Total Corporate and Other $ 1,066 $ 870 $ 1,012 23 % 14 % Gross Margin Europe Utilities $ 21 $ 16 $ 34 31 % 53 % Africa Utilities 65 71 30 8 % 137 % Africa Generation 54 41 28 32 % 46 % Wind Generation 44 11 19 300 % 42 % Corp/Other 2 (22 ) (49 ) 109 % 55 % Total Corporate and Other $ 186 $ 117 $ 62 59 % 89 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $30 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other revenue increased $226 million for 2010, or 26% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: higher volume at our utility businesses in Ukraine driven by an overall increase in market demand; higher volume and utility tariffs at Sonel in Cameroon driven by an increase in market demand; and incremental revenue from new wind generation projects that commenced operations during the year and an overall volume increase across our wind businesses. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $8 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $77 million for 2010, or 66% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: an increase in gross margin from our new wind generation projects and higher volume, as discussed above; and an increase in volume at Dibamba, our generation business, in Cameroon. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs at Sonel. 139 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $162 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other revenue increased $20 million for 2009, or 2%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: higher tariffs in Ukraine of $27 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $12 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $67 million for 2009, or 108%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: a decrease in fixed costs across the Africa region. The increase was partially offset by: higher fuel consumption attributable to lower hydrology at Sonel. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense includes those expenses related to corporate and region staff functions and or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems, and development costs. General and administrative expenses increased $53 million, or 16%, to $392 million in 2010 from 2009. The increase is primarily related to business development costs associated with increased development efforts, primarily in Europe, Turkey and India. General and administrative expenses decreased $29 million, or 8%, to $339 million in 2009 from 2008. The decrease is primarily related to 2008 professional fees associated with remediation efforts and a reduction in business development costs. The favorable variance is partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the worldwide implementation of SAP. Interest expense Interest expense increased $41 million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to interest expense at Cartagena which is now a consolidated entity, higher interest rates at Tiet&ecirc;, increased debt principal at Eletropaulo and interest being expensed related to St. Nikola, our wind project in Bulgaria, due to commencement of operations in 2010. These increases were partially offset by reduced debt principal at the Parent Company. Interest expense decreased $285 million, or 16%, to $1.5 billion in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates globally due to economic conditions and inflationary adjustments to the market price index in Brazil. In addition, interest expense decreased as a result of favorable foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil and lower interest expenses associated with decreased debt balances at Eletropaulo. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense at Masinloc in the Philippines which was acquired in April 2008, and interest expense at Infovias in Brazil where a fee on a non exercised credit line was written off. Interest income Interest income increased $63 million, or 18%, to $411 million in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to a higher average balance in short term investments at Eletropaulo and the favorable impact of 140 Table of Contents foreign currency translation in Brazil as well as the settlement of a dispute related to inflation adjustments for energy sales at Tiet&ecirc;. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest income from a loan to a wind development project in Brazil which was repaid in June 2010. Interest income decreased $171 million, or 33%, to $348 million in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances in Brazil, unfavorable foreign currency translation in Brazil, the impact of decreased interest rates and inflationary adjustments on accounts receivable in 2008 at Gener in Chile and a decreased cash balance at the Parent Company. Other income Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Gain on extinguishment of tax and other liabilities $ 65 $ 168 $ 199 Tax credit settlement 129 Performance incentive fee 80 Insurance proceeds 40 Gain on sale of assets 12 14 34 Other 31 74 102 Total other income $ 108 $ 465 $ 375 Other income of $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to the extinguishment of a swap liability owed by two of our Brazilian subsidiaries, resulting in the recognition of a $62 million gain. The net impact to the Company after taxes and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Other income also included a gain on sale of assets at Eletropaulo. Other income of $465 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $165 million from the reduction in interest and penalties associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the REFIS program and a $129 million gain related to a favorable court decision enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. The net impact to the Company after income taxes and noncontrolling interests for these items was $44 million. In addition, the Company recognized income in 2009 of $80 million from a performance incentive bonus for management services provided to Ekibastuz and Maikuben in 2008. The management agreement was related to the sale of these businesses in Kazakhstan in May 2008; see further discussion of this transaction in Note 22 Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Other income of $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included gains on the extinguishment of a gross receipts tax liability and a legal contingency at Eletropaulo of $117 million and $75 million, respectively, $32 million of cash proceeds related to a favorable legal settlement at Southland in California, $29 million of insurance recoveries for damaged turbines at Uruguaiana, $23 million of gains associated with a sale of land at Eletropaulo and sales of turbines at Itabo, and compensation of $18 million for the impairment associated with the settlement agreement to shut down Hefei. 141 Table of Contents Other expense Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Loss on sale and disposal of assets $ 84 $ 42 $ 34 Gener gas settlement 72 Loss on extinguishment of debt 37 70 AES Wind transaction costs 22 Other 24 69 57 Total other expense $ 239 $ 111 $ 161 Other expense of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $72 million for a settlement agreement of gas transportation contracts at Gener. There were also previously capitalized transaction costs of $22 million that were incurred in connection with the preparation for the sale of a noncontrolling interest in our Wind Generation business which were written off upon the expiration of the letter of intent in June 2010. In addition, there were losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo, Panama, and Gener, an $18 million loss on debt extinguishment at Andres and Itabo and a $15 million loss at the Parent Company from the retirement of senior notes. Other expense of $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $13 million loss recognized when three of our businesses in the Dominican Republic received $110 million par value bonds issued by the Dominican Republic government to settle existing accounts receivable for the same amount from the government owned distribution companies. The loss represented an adjustment to reflect the fair value of the bonds on the date received. Other expense also included losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo and Andres and contingencies at our businesses in Kazakhstan and Alicura in Argentina. Other expense of $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $69 million of losses on the retirement of debt at the Parent Company in connection with the refinancing in June 2008 and IPALCO associated with a $375 million refinancing in April 2008 and losses on disposal of assets primarily at Eletropaulo. Goodwill Impairment In 2010, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2010, Deepwater, our pet coke fired merchant generation facility in Texas, determined that there was an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. This determination was primarily based on managements decision not to operate the plant for more than 30 days in the third quarter of 2010, current operating and cash flow losses, and forecasted operating and cash flow losses for the remainder of 2010 through 2014 as a result of declining trends in energy pricing curves and increasing pet coke prices. As a result, Deepwater recognized a goodwill impairment of $18 million. Deepwater is reported in the North America Generation segment. In 2009, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $122 million. This was a result of impairment at certain of our businesses in the United Kingdom and Ukraine as a result of the Companys annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of October 1. The most significant goodwill impairment was at Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom. Factors contributing to the recognition of impairment included: reduced profit expectations based on latest estimates of future commodity prices and reduced expectations on the recovery of cash flows on the existing plant following the Companys decision to forgo capital expenditures to meet emission allowance requirements taking effect in 2024. The fair value of the Companys reporting units are inherently sensitive to the assumptions underlying the estimates of fair value. Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Fair Value, Goodwill and Intangibles in Item 8 of this Form 10 K provides a 142 Table of Contents more detailed discussion of those assumptions. As discussed in Key Trends and Uncertainties, in the future, the fair values of the Companys reporting units might decline as a result of adverse changes in their operating environments or the businesses reaching the end of their finite lives, which could require the Company to record additional goodwill impairment charges. The Company did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2008. Asset Impairment Expense As discussed in Note 19 Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, asset impairment expense for the year 2010 was $1,221 million and consisted primarily of the following: Eastern Energy AEE operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated a recoverability test of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Southland In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and the exact form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process 143 Table of Contents through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations and the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. The Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment. The asset group was determined to be at the individual plant level and based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined that the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the Huntington Beach asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying value of the Huntington Beach plant of $288 million exceeded the fair value of $88 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $200 million. The undiscounted cash flows of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach generation facilities exceeded their respective carrying values and resulted in no impairment. Huntington Beach is reported in the North America Generation reportable segment. Tisza II During the third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into annual negotiations with the offtaker of its Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. As a result of these preliminary negotiations, as well as the further deterioration of the economic environment in Hungary, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. Thus, the Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and determined that based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount of the Tisza II asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The carrying value of the Tisza II asset group of $160 million exceeded the fair value of $75 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $85 million. Tisza II is reported in the Europe Generation reportable segment. Deepwater In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW pet coke fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, 144 Table of Contents all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Asset impairment expense for the year 2009 was $25 million. In 2009, the Company recognized a pre tax long lived asset impairment charge of $11 million related to the Companys Piabanha hydro project in Brazil. The Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows and abandoned the project. Asset impairment expense for the year 2008 was $175 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, the Company reviewed and prioritized projects in the development pipeline. From this review, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows for certain projects. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $75 million ($34 million, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes) related to two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non power development project at one of our facilities in North America. During 2008, the Company recognized additional impairment charges of $36 million related to long lived assets at Uruguaiana. The impairment was triggered by a combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy in 2007 that continued in 2008. Following an initial impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, further charges were incurred in 2008 due to fixed asset purchase agreements in place. During the first half of 2008, the Company withdrew from projects in South Africa and Israel which resulted in impairment charges of $36 million. The Company also recognized an impairment of $18 million related to the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China. Gain on sale of investments There was no gain on sale of investments in 2010. Gain on sale of investments of $131 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $98 million recognized in May 2009 related to the termination of the management agreement between the Company and Kazakhmys PLC for Ekibastuz and Maikuben, a gain of $14 million from the sale of the remaining assets associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China and $13 million from the reversal of a contingent liability related to the Kazakhstan sale in 2008. Gain on sale of investments of $909 million in 2008 consisted primarily of the sale in May 2008 of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Ekibastuz and Maikuben for a net gain of $905 million. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock There was no loss on sale of subsidiary stock in 2010 or 2009. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock of $31 million in 2008 was the result of sales of AES Gener shares made by our wholly owned subsidiary Cachagua. In November 2008, Cachagua sold 9.6% of its ownership in Gener to a third party reducing its ownership in Gener to 70.6%. 145 Table of Contents Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Companys net monetary position from foreign currency transaction activities: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) AES Corporation $ (50 ) $ 13 $ 38 Chile 8 65 (96 ) Philippines 8 15 (57 ) Brazil (6 ) (9 ) (44 ) Argentina 12 (10 ) (28 ) Kazakhstan 1 (24 ) 14 Colombia (4 ) (11 ) 5 Other (2 ) (6 ) (16 ) Total(1) $ (33 ) $ 33 $ (184 ) (1) Includes (losses) gains of $(10) million, $(39) million and $10 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These losses consisted primarily of losses at The AES Corporation partially offset by gains in Argentina. Losses of $50 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the devaluation of notes receivable resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound, and losses on foreign exchange swaps and options, partially offset by gains on cash balances and debt denominated in British Pounds. Gains of $12 million in Argentina were primarily due to a gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso by 5%, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These gains consisted primarily of gains in Chile, the Philippines and at The AES Corporation partially offset by losses in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. Gains of $65 million in Chile were primarily due to the appreciation of the Chilean Peso of 20% resulting in gains at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Peso, mainly cash and accounts receivables. This gain was partially offset by $14 million in losses on foreign currency derivatives. Gains of $15 million in the Philippines were primarily due to the appreciation of the Philippine Peso of 3%, resulting in gains at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on the remeasurement of U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $13 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the settlement of the senior unsecured credit facility and the revaluation of notes receivable denominated in the Euro, partially offset by losses on debt denominated in British Pounds. Losses of $24 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar and $12 million of foreign currency transaction losses on debt and other liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Kazakh Tenge. 146 Table of Contents Losses of $11 million in Colombia were primarily due to the appreciation of the Colombian Peso of 9%, resulting in losses at Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its Colombian Peso denominated debt and losses on foreign currency derivatives. Losses of $10 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2009, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt, partially offset by derivative gains. Losses of $9 million in Brazil were primarily due to energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar, resulting in foreign currency transaction losses of $18 million, partially offset by gains of $9 million due to the appreciation in 2009 of the Brazilian Real of 25%, resulting in gains at Sul and Uruguaiana associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These losses consisted primarily of losses in Chile, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina partially offset by gains at The AES Corporation and in Kazakhstan. Losses of $96 million in Chile were primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso of 28% in 2008, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable and value added tax (VAT) receivables. Losses of $57 million in the Philippines were primarily due to remeasurement losses at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on U.S. Dollar denominated debt resulting from depreciation of the Philippine Peso of 14% in 2008. Losses of $44 million in Brazil were primarily due to the realization of deferred exchange variance on past energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar. Losses of $28 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2008, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $38 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to debt denominated in British Pounds and gains on foreign exchange derivatives, partially offset by losses on notes receivable denominated in the Euro. Gains of $14 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction gains of $16 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar, offset by $5 million of foreign currency transaction losses on external and intercompany debt denominated in other than the Kazakh Tenge functional currency. Income taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $292 million, or 49%, to $307 million in 2010. The Companys effective tax rates were 29% for 2010 and 26% for 2009. The net increase in the 2010 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 relating to the CEMIG sale transaction, tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowances at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, and $165 million of non taxable income recorded in 2009 at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program. These items were offset by income tax benefits related to a reversal of withholding tax liabilities at certain Chilean subsidiaries and 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries. Included in the net tax expense related to the CEMIG sale transaction is tax expense on the equity earnings associated with the reversal of the net long term liability and tax benefit related to release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. 147 Table of Contents Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $172 million, or 22%, to $599 million in 2009. The Companys effective tax rates were 26% for 2009 and 29% for 2008. The net decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowance at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recorded at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $91 million, or 99%, to $183 million in 2010 from $92 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a gain recognized upon the sale of our interest in CEMIG during the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by 2009 equity in earnings of Cartagena which was accounted for as a consolidated entity in 2010 and thus reported directly within revenues and expenses. Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $59 million, or 179%, to $92 million in 2009 from $33 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a cash settlement received by Cartagena, in Spain, in June 2009 for liquidated damages received related to a construction delay from December 2005 to November 2006; increased earnings at Guacolda in Chile mainly due to lower cost of coal; increased earnings of Chigen affiliates from higher tariffs partially offset by lower volume and a valuation write off in 2008 at an affiliate in Turkey. These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings at OPGC, in India, mainly due to lower tariff and a dividend distribution tax in March 2009 and increased expenses for an equipment overhaul at Elsta in the Netherlands. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $93 million, or 8%, to $1.0 billion in 2010 from $1.1 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreased earnings at Eletropaulo as a result of the absence of legal settlement income present in 2009, a loss on legal settlement at Gener and reduced revenues due to decreased coal prices along with higher electricity purchases at Itabo. These decreases were partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian Real. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $340 million, or 45%, to $1.1 billion in 2009 from $0.8 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to increases in gross margin and other income, lower interest expense and a decrease in impairments in 2009 at our Brazilian businesses, and increases in gross margin and foreign currency transaction gains at our businesses in Chile. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $44 million at certain of our wind generation businesses as a result of a charge related to the potential future taxes that could be deemed due in the calculation of the hypothetical liquidation value of certain of our wind tax equity partnerships. Discontinued operations As further discussed in Note 21 Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Businesses to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, Discontinued Operations includes the results of five businesses: Ras Laffan, a generation business in Qatar (sold in October 2010); Barka, a generation business in Oman, (sold in August 2010); Lal Pir and Pak Gen, generation businesses in Pakistan, (sold in June 2010); and Jiaozuo, a generation business in China, (sold in December 2008). Prior periods have been restated to reflect these businesses within Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. In 2010, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $39 million and reflected the operations of our 55% stake in Ras Laffan, a combined cycle gas facility and water desalination plant in Qatar, our 35% stake in Barka, a combined cycle gas 148 Table of Contents facility and water desalination plant in Oman and our 55% stake in Lal Pir and Pak Gen, two oil fired facilities in Pakistan. The sale of Lal Pir and Pak Gen closed in June 2010, resulting in additional impairment expense and a loss on the sale in 2010 of $14 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The Barka plant was sold in August 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $63 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The sale of Ras Laffan closed in October 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $6 million, net of tax. In 2009, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $54 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir and Pak Gen. Loss on disposal of discontinued businesses, net of tax and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $105 million and represented the difference between the net book value of the Companys interests in its Pakistan businesses and their estimated fair value. In 2008, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $60 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir, Pak Gen and Jiaozuo, a coal fired generation facility in China sold in December 2008. The Company received $73 million for its 70% interest in the business. The net gain on the disposition was $7 million. Critical Accounting Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Companys most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Reserves We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the tax jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material. 149 Table of Contents On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act). The Act includes several provisions which provide for tax relief for businesses by extending certain tax benefits and credits, including the Subpart F exception for active financing income and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look through provisions of Subpart F. This legislation resulted in a benefit for the Companys 2010 provision for income taxes; however, there can be no assurances that the benefits of this legislation will extend beyond 2011, when it is currently scheduled to expire. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Goodwill and Other Intangibles and Long lived Assets, respectively, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level on October 1. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying amount. A long lived asset (asset group) will be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e., the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are less than its carrying amount. In the event that the carrying amount of the long lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment evaluation is performed, in which the fair value of the asset is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. Examples of indicators that would result in an impairment test for goodwill and a recoverability test for long lived assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate, legislation changes or a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition. Throughout the impairment evaluation process, management makes considerable judgments; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part of an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost/benefit analysis and the Companys internal valuation knowledge of the long lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the DCF model), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factors expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. 150 Table of Contents A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Managements Discussion and Analysis, Consolidated Results of Operations Goodwill Impairment and Asset Impairment Expense and Note 19 Impairment Expense and Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Fair Value Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent), derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long term liabilities. The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Companys investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Companys derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where 151 Table of Contents derivatives qualify and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Companys interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Companys derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterpartys) and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Platts). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instruments fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on indicative pricing quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities The Company adopted the fair value measurement accounting guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009. The most significant of these estimates surround the fair value measurement of long lived tangible and intangible assets when tested for impairment upon a triggering event or during the annual impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill. These estimates include making assumptions regarding useful life, the impact of economic obsolescence and expected future cash flows. Additional factors are discussed above in the Impairments section. 152 Table of Contents Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard creates a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Impairments. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks. We often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could be lower than contracted prices and would expose these businesses to considerable price volatility. At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facilitys output, in some cases under long term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. We have also hedged a portion of our exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price power sales. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. If we were unable to enter into replacement PPAs, these businesses may have to sell power at market prices. 81 Table of Contents The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to The AES Corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. The market pricing of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in future periods. The market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future. Stock price movements on a quarter by quarter basis for the past two years are set forth in Item 5. Market Market Information of this Form 10 K. Factors that could affect the price of our common stock in the future include general conditions in our industry, in the power markets in which we participate and in the world, including environmental and economic developments, over which we have no control, as well as developments specific to us, including, risks that could result in revenue and earnings volatility as well as other risk factors described in this Item 1A. Risk Factors and those matters described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Risks Associated with our Operations We do a significant amount of business outside the United States, including in developing countries, which presents significant risks. A significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the United States and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. Part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in developing countries because the growth rates and the opportunity to implement operating improvements and achieve higher operating margins may be greater than those typically achievable in more developed countries. International operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region; adverse changes in currency exchange rates; government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds; unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies; high inflation and monetary fluctuations; restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate; threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments; difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with GAAP expertise; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties; inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems; adverse changes in government tax policy; 82 Table of Contents difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions. Any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, partly in response to challenging business and political conditions in Kazakhstan, in 2008, we sold certain businesses in that country. As another example, in the second quarter of 2007, we sold our stake in EDC to Petr&oacute;leos de Venezuela, S.A., the state owned energy company in Venezuela after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened to expropriate the electricity business in Venezuela. In connection with the sale, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $680 million. In addition, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenues and gross margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. The operation of power generation and distribution facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results. We and or our subsidiaries may not have adequate insurance coverage for liabilities. We are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including: changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, explosions, terrorist acts or other similar occurrences; and changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to: gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance. Our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations, or interruptions in transportation including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. This could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurring a liability for liquidated damages and or other penalties. As a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation and distribution industries, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to 83 Table of Contents transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or certain external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks. The hazards described above can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A claim for which we are not fully insured or insured at all could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our businesses insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with its operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results or operations, financial condition and prospects. Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our inability to attract and retain skilled people could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. In particular, we routinely are required to assess the financial and tax impacts of complicated business transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. These assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise in GAAP to timely and accurately comply with United States reporting obligations. An inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse affect on our financial and tax reporting. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for load requirements and may result in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. The uncertainty regarding the amount of power that our power generation and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our operating costs. A significant under or over estimation of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much power to cover their obligations, in which case we would be required to buy or sell power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. Those prices may not be favorable and thus could increase our operating costs. 84 Table of Contents We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. Even when we successfully enter into long term contracts, our generation businesses are often dependent on one or a limited number of customers and a limited number of fuel suppliers. Many of our generation plants conduct business under long term contracts. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plants output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts range from 1 to 25 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable. For example, during the past several years, various governmental authorities in Europe have terminated or declined to fulfill their obligations under long term contracts with our subsidiaries. In 2008, as part of the accession to the European Union, the Hungarian government terminated all long term PPAs, including AES Tiszas PPA, as of December 31, 2008. Partly as a result of the termination AES Tiszas results of operations declined and we were required to record an $85 million asset impairment charge for AES Tisza in the third quarter of 2010. Kilroot in Northern Ireland received notice from the Utility Regulator directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the Generating Unit Agreements for the two coal fired units effective November 1, 2010 and, as a result, the performance (and contributions to income and cash flow) from Kilroot will decline in 2011 when compared to prior years. Furthermore, these businesses (and any other businesses whose long term contracts may be challenged) may have to sell electricity into the spot markets. Because of the volatile nature of inputs and power prices, the inability to secure long term contracts could generate increased volatility in our earnings and cash flows and could generate substantial losses (or result in a write down of assets), which could have a material impact on our business and results of operations. We have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customers obligations. However, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment grade credit rating, and our Generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful. These risks have increased as a result of the deteriorating and volatile global economy. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential impact on the Company, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions in this Form 10 K. Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us. The power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain 85 Table of Contents markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas fired power plants have also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on us. Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions. Certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Of the twenty nine defined benefit plans, three are at United States subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. The Company periodically evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. The Companys exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans are more heavily weighted to investments in fixed income securities that have not been as severely impacted by the global recession. Future downturns in the debt and or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. Our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. This may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the Parent Company and our subsidiaries liquidity. For additional information regarding the funding position of the Companys pension plans, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Pension and Postretirement Obligations and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K. Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties. Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing greenfield power plants, some but not all of which have signed long term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to failures of siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. Timing of equipment purchases can also pose financial risks to the Company. As part of our development process, we attempt to make purchases of equipment and or materials as needed. However, from time to time, there may be excess demand for certain types of equipment with substantial delays between the time we place orders and receive delivery. In those instances, to avoid construction delays and costs associated with the inability to own and place such equipment and or materials into service when needed in the construction process, we may place orders well in advance of deployment. In some cases, we may order such equipment and or materials without yet having a specific project where the equipment and or materials will be deployed, in anticipation that equipment and materials will be needed at the time of delivery. However, there is a risk that at the time of delivery, we are required to accept delivery and pay for such equipment and or materials, even though no project has materialized where these items will be used. This can result in our having to incur material equipment and or material costs, with no deployment plan at delivery. Financing risk has also increased as a result of the deterioration of the global economy and the crisis in the financial markets and, as a result, we may forgo certain development opportunities. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are 86 Table of Contents recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, management believes that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this timeframe. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. Historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses may be government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that: we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership; such businesses will perform as expected; integration or other one time costs will not be greater than expected; we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities; such business will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest our capital to acquire them. 87 Table of Contents In some of our joint venture projects and businesses, we have granted protective rights to minority holders or we own less than a majority of the equity in the project or business and do not manage or otherwise control the project or business, which entails certain risks. We have invested in some joint ventures where we own less than a majority of the voting equity in the venture. Very often, one of our subsidiaries seeks to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of projects or businesses in which we have less than a majority of the ownership interests by operating the project or business pursuant to a management contract, negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we do not always have this type of control over the project or business in every instance; and we may be dependent on our co venturers to operate such projects or businesses. Our co venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally. The approval of co venturers also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. In some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders. For example, Companhia Brasiliana de Energia (Brasiliana) is a holding company in which we have a controlling equity interest and through which we own three of our four Brazilian businesses: Eletropaulo, Tiet&ecirc; and Uruguaiana. We entered into a shareholders agreement with an affiliate of the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) which owns more than 49% of the voting equity of Brasiliana. Among other things, the shareholders agreement requires the consent of both parties before taking certain corporate actions, grants both parties rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of interests in Brasiliana and grants certain drag along rights to BNDES. In May 2007, BNDES notified us that it intends to sell all of its interest in Brasiliana pursuant to a public auction (the Brasiliana Sale). BNDES also informed us that if we fail to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of its interest in Brasiliana, then BNDES intends to exercise its drag along rights under the shareholders agreement and cause us to sell all of our interests in Brasiliana in the Brasiliana Sale as well. BNDES has since suspended the auction; however, BNDES may determine to recommence a sale process in the future. In that event, after the auction, if a third party offer has been received in the Brasiliana Sale, we will have 30 days to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of BNDESs interest in Brasiliana on the same terms as the third party offer. If we do not exercise this right and BNDES proceeds to exercise its drag along rights, then we may be forced to sell all of our interest in Brasiliana. Due to the uncertainty in the sale price at this point in time, we are uncertain whether we will exercise our right of first refusal should BNDES receive a valid third party offer in the Brasiliana Sale and, if we do, whether we would do it alone or with joint venture partners. Even if we desire to exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot assure that we will have the cash on hand or that debt or equity financing will be available at acceptable terms in order to purchase BNDESs interest in Brasiliana. If we do not exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot be assured that we will not have to record a loss if the sale price is below the book value of our investment in Brasiliana. Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and regulatory challenges. AES Wind Generation, AES Solar, our greenhouse gas emissions reductions projects (GHG Emissions Reduction Projects), and our investments in projects such as energy storage are subject to substantial risks. Projects of this nature have been developed through advancement in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and which are unrelated to our core business. Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future. For example, several European countries have recently faced a debt crisis, which has or may result in government austerity measures. If these incentives are repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, this could materially impact our renewable businesses, results of operations and financial condition, and impact the ability of the affected 88 Table of Contents businesses to continue or grow their operations. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries, which could also have a material impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, production levels for our wind, solar, and GHG Emissions Reduction Projects may be dependent upon adequate wind, sunlight, or biogas production which can vary significantly from period to period, resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. For example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year. With regard to GHG Emissions Reduction Projects, there is particular uncertainty about whether agreements providing incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, such as the Kyoto Protocol, will continue and whether countries around the world will enact or maintain legislation that provides incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, without which such projects may not be economical or financing for such projects may become unavailable. As a result, renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. In addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in Generation and Utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that many of these projects exist in new or emerging markets, where long term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. These projects can be capital intensive and generally require that we obtain third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects. These risks may be exacerbated by the current global economic crisis, including our managements increased focus on liquidity, which may also result in slower growth in the number of projects we can pursue. The economic downturn could also impact the value of our assets in these countries and our ability to develop these projects. If the value of these assets decline, this could result in a material impairment or a series of impairments which are material in the aggregate, which would adversely affect our financial statements. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or long lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. The fair value of a reporting unit has been determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill outside of the required annual assessment process if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. There could also be impairments if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. See further discussion in Risk Factor, Our Acquisitions May Not Perform as Expected. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. As of December 31, 2010, we had $1.3 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3% of total assets. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to 89 Table of Contents impair goodwill, as further described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Long lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives. Long lived assets are evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of long lived assets, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates, commodity prices and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. Generally, the fair value of a long lived asset or asset group is determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each asset group. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or adverse action or assessment by a regulator. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in additional long lived asset impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to impair long lived assets, as further described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather. Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In the past, our businesses in Latin America have been negatively impacted by lower than normal rainfall. Similarly, our wind businesses are dependent on adequate wind conditions while the solar projects at AES Solar are dependent on sufficient sunlight. In each case, inadequate wind or sunlight could have a material adverse impact on these businesses. Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes. Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our Utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to: changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations; 90 Table of Contents changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utilitys operating income or the rates it charges customers is too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates; changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non controllable costs; adverse changes in tax law; changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium; changes in the timing of tariff increases; other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business. Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business. In many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing or the regulations can be difficult to interpret. As a result, there is risk that we may not properly interpret certain regulations and may not understand the impact of certain regulations on our business. For example, in October 2006, ANEEL, which regulates our utility operations at Sul and Eletropaulo in Brazil, issued Normative Resolution 234 requiring that utilities begin amortizing a liability called Special Obligations beginning with their second tariff reset cycle in 2007 or a later year as an offset to depreciation expense. As of May 23, 2007, the date of the filing of our 2006 Form 10 K, no industry positions or any other consensus had been reached regarding how ANEEL guidance should be applied at that date and accordingly, no adjustments to the financial statements were made relating to Special Obligations in Brazil. Subsequent to May 23, 2007, industry discussions occurred and other Brazilian companies filed Forms 20 F with the SEC reflecting the impact of Resolution 234 in their December 31, 2006 financial statements differently from how the Company accounted for Resolution 234. In the absence of any significant regulatory developments between May 23, 2007 and the date of these other filings, the Company determined that Resolution 234 required us to record an adjustment to our Special Obligations liability as of December 31, 2006. In part, the decision to record the adjustment led to the restatement of our financial statements in the third quarter of 2007. If we face additional challenges interpreting regulations or changes in regulations, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act). While the bulk of regulations contained in the Dodd Frank Act regulate financial institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive compensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to public companies generally. The types of provisions described above are currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Furthermore, while the Dodd Frank Act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, the Dodd Frank Act provides for commercial end user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions, though this is not certain since the Act directs the SEC, CFTC and listed companies to enact rules that will clarify the Dodd Frank Act, and such rulemaking could impact the availability of the commercial end user exemption. Even if the exemption is available, the Dodd Frank Act could still have a material adverse impact on the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non exempt companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these risks. Even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, which could adversely affect the operating results of certain projects; cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated to hedge certain risks, such as project financing agreements; prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; cause the Company to abandon certain of its hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; and or consume substantial liquidity by forcing the Company to post cash and or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 91 Table of Contents On June 12, 2009 AES Kelanitissa received a letter and an invoice from the Director General, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUC) seeking payment of an Annual Regulatory Fee and pursuant to PUC assurances on an application for renewal of the AES Kelanitissa generation license. The application is pursuant to an April 2009 revision of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act (Electricity Act), which came into force in April 2009, notwithstanding that in March 29, 2001, AES Kelanitissa had been granted, and pre paid fees for, a 21 year generation license with effect from September 25, 2000 under the Electricity Act, 1950. AES Kelanitissa submitted an application to be licensed under the revised legislation and, on August 26, 2009, PUC published its intention to issue a generation license under the revised legislation to AES Kelanitissa and other Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in Sri Lanka. This was consistent with assurances received from relevant authorities that the revised legislation was to be amended to grandfather IPPs with existing generation licenses. In a letter dated June 21, 2010 from the PUC, AES Kelanitissa was informed that under the new regulations, as amended in 2009, AES Kelanitissa (Pvt) Ltd no longer fulfilled the eligibility criteria to apply for a generation license. The eligibility criteria to which the letter refers is a provision requiring an element of state ownership. Representatives of AES Kelanitissa have been informed that an amendment to the Electricity Act to grandfather existing IPPs remains in the legislative pipeline, although it is not possible to predict with certainty when or whether such an amendment will be passed. In addition, AES Kelanitissa believes that under Sri Lankan law, it may continue operations under the 21 year license issued in 2001. No step has been taken to date to prohibit AES Kelanitissa from generating power and conducting its operations. However, in the event that it is determined that AES Kelanitissa may not operate under its current license or the revised legislation is not amended (and PUC maintains that AES Kelanitissa is ineligible for a generation license or extension of the Generating License), AES Kelanitissa may not be able to continue operations on grounds that it has no license under the revised legislation. In that event, AES Kelanitissa and or the Company could face a number of adverse consequences, including potential litigation with counterparties mitigating a write down in the value of the assets of the business, continued default status under its debt documents and or other consequences which could have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Our Generation business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the FERC, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations. EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the obligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of the Midwest Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) Interconnection, L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is authorized under the new law to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case by case basis. While the new law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to PURPA, our QFs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long term contracts expire. EPAct 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the United States generation market. 92 Table of Contents In accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets. While the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost of service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate. Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our activities are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air and water emissions. See the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters of this Form 10 K. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies. The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal fired generating plants alleging wide spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with approximately 17 companies over such allegations. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. The principal focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO2 and NOX. In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOX. One of our businesses, IPL, is currently the subject of such an EPA enforcement action, and another business, Eastern Energy, has received an information request from the EPA in connection with a possible enforcement action. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10 K for more detail with respect to these EPA enforcement actions and information requests. There can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations. 93 Table of Contents Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As discussed in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations, at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect or policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2010, the Companys subsidiaries operated businesses which had total approximate CO2 emissions of 77.2 million metric tonnes approximately 40 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 18 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based upon a number of projections and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect such as the forecast dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO2 emissions and our subsidiaries achieving completion of such construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with emissions described below. Because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates. The subsidiaries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there can be no assurance that the subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the Company. Foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial performance. The actual impact on the Companys financial performance and the financial performance of the Companys subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the cost of emissions reduction equipment the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material impact on our results of operations. In January 2005, based on European Community Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading, the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) commenced operation as the largest multi country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the 40 developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO2. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In the United States, there currently is no legislation establishing federal mandatory GHG emission reduction programs (including CO2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. However, federal GHG legislation has been proposed in the United States Congress that would, if enacted, constrain GHG emissions, including CO2, and or impose costs on 94 Table of Contents us that could be material to our business or results of operations. The EPA has also initiated regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new sources of GHG emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing sources planning physical changes that would increase their GHG emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. Such regulations could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse effect on our business and or results of operations. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regulations. At the state level, RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast, became effective in January 2009, and the WCI is also developing market based programs to address GHG emissions in seven western states. In addition, several states, including California, have adopted comprehensive legislation that, when effective, will require mandatory GHG reductions from several industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about the United States state environmental regulations we face. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below), the Company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with United States federal, regional or state CO2 emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that these proposals are in earlier stages of development and any final regulations or legislation, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. The RGGI program became effective in January 2009. The first regional auction of RGGI allowances needed to be acquired by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI was held in September 2008, with subsequent auctions occurring approximately every quarter. Our subsidiaries in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland are subject to RGGI. Of the approximately 40 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2010 (ownership adjusted), approximately 11.3 million metric tonnes were emitted in United States states participating in RGGI. Over the past three years, such emissions have averaged approximately 10.9 million metric tonnes. While CO2 emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of CO2 compliance based on a 3 year average of CO2 emissions for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes a price of $1.86 per allowance under RGGI. The source of this allowance price estimate was the clearing price in the recent RGGI allowance auction held in December 2010. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $15 million for 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance. In addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. For example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. In addition, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. In addition, environmental groups and other private plaintiffs have brought and may decide to bring additional private lawsuits against the Company because of its subsidiaries GHG emissions. The Company is facing and may face in the future private lawsuits relating to GHG emissions that may have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. In one recent case in the United States, which does not involve the Company, a federal appellate court reversed the dismissal by a federal district court of nuisance and other claims against emitters of GHG based on property damage allegedly caused by their contributions to global warming. While the scope of relief sought in that case is 95 Table of Contents unclear, the plaintiffs in this case evidently seek injunctive relief to prevent or reduce further GHG emissions. The defendants appealed the appellate court decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court is expected to render a decision in 2011. If the defendants do not prevail, other parties may be encouraged to bring similar suits against electric power generators, including the Company or any of its United States subsidiaries. Also, unless the United States Congress acts to preempt such suits as part of comprehensive federal legislation, additional lawsuits may be brought against the Company or its subsidiaries. At this stage of the litigation, it is impossible to predict whether such lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the Companys business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Companys subsidiaries. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel fired electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation. In addition to potential physical risks noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of the Company and its subsidiaries due to public perception of GHG emissions by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHG emissions made by subsidiaries of the Company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the Company. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the Companys subsidiaries and on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our subsidiaries have operations in the United States and various non United States jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many non United States jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as non United States, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities. We and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. We and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. 96 Table of Contents The SEC is conducting an informal inquiry relating to our restatements. We have been cooperating with an informal inquiry by the SEC Staff concerning our past restatements and related matters, and have been providing information and documents to the SEC Staff on a voluntary basis. Although we have not received correspondence regarding this inquiry for some time, we have not been advised that the matter is closed. Because we are unable to predict the outcome of this inquiry, the SEC Staff may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported the financial impact of the adjustments to previously filed financial statements and there may be a risk that the inquiry by the SEC could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate previously filed financial statements, amend prior filings or take other actions not currently contemplated. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We maintain offices in many places around the world, generally pursuant to the provisions of long and short term leases, none of which we believe are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are described in Item 1 of this Form 10 K, are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the projects related finance facility. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased. However, in a few instances, no accompanying project financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business, some of which are described below. The Company has accrued for litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has evaluated claims in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies that it deems both probable and reasonably estimable and accordingly, has recorded aggregate reserves for all claims for approximately $450 million and $482 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. These are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within accrued and other liabilities and other long term liabilities. A significant portion of these reserves relate to employment, non income tax and customer disputes in international jurisdictions, principally Brazil. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries, principally in Brazil, are defendants in a number of labor and employment lawsuits. The complaints generally seek unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or other relief. The subsidiaries have denied any liability and intend to vigorously defend themselves in all of these proceedings. There can be no assurance that this reserve will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise. The Company believes, based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. However, even where no reserve has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company, and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material. In 1989, Centrais El&eacute;tricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobr&aacute;s) filed suit in the Fifth District Court in the State of Rio de Janeiro against Eletropaulo Eletricidade de S&atilde;o Paulo S.A. (EEDSP) relating to the methodology for calculating monetary adjustments under the parties financing agreement. In April 1999, the Fifth District Court 97 Table of Contents found for Eletrobr&aacute;s and in September 2001, Eletrobr&aacute;s initiated an execution suit in the Fifth District Court to collect approximately R$1.10 billion ($659 million) from Eletropaulo (as estimated by Eletropaulo) and a lesser amount from an unrelated company, Companhia de Transmiss&atilde;o de Energia El&eacute;trica Paulista (CTEEP) (Eletropaulo and CTEEP were spun off from EEDSP pursuant to its privatization in 1998). In November 2002, the Fifth District Court rejected Eletropaulos defenses in the execution suit. Eletropaulo appealed and in September 2003, the Appellate Court of the State of Rio de Janeiro (AC) ruled that Eletropaulo was not a proper party to the litigation because any alleged liability had been transferred to CTEEP pursuant to the privatization. In June 2006, the Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) reversed the Appellate Courts decision and remanded the case to the Fifth District Court for further proceedings, holding that Eletropaulos liability, if any, should be determined by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulos subsequent appeals to the Special Court (the highest court within the SCJ) and the Supreme Court of Brazil were dismissed. Eletrobr&aacute;s later requested that the amount of Eletropaulos alleged debt be determined by an accounting expert appointed by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulo consented to the appointment of such an expert, subject to a reservation of rights. In February 2010, the Fifth District Court appointed an accounting expert to determine the amount of the alleged debt and the responsibility for its payment in light of the privatization, in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletrobr&aacute;s. Pursuant to its reservation of rights, Eletropaulo filed an interlocutory appeal with the AC asserting that the expert was required to determine the issues in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletropaulo, and that Eletropaulo should be entitled to take discovery and present arguments on the issues to be determined by the expert. In April 2010, the AC issued a decision agreeing with Eletropaulos arguments and directing the Fifth District Court to proceed accordingly. Eletrobr&aacute;s may restart the accounting proceedings at the Fifth District Court at any time, which would proceed according to the ACs April 2010 decision. In the Fifth District Court proceedings, the experts conclusions will be subject to the Fifth District Courts review and approval. If Eletropaulo is determined to be responsible for the debt, after the amount of the alleged debt is determined, Eletrobr&aacute;s will be entitled to resume the execution suit in the Fifth District Court at any time. If Eletrobr&aacute;s does so, Eletropaulo will be required to provide security in the amount of its alleged liability. In that case, if Eletrobr&aacute;s requests the seizure of such security and the Fifth District Court grants such request, Eletropaulos results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and in turn the Companys results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, in February 2008, CTEEP filed a lawsuit in the Fifth District Court against Eletrobr&aacute;s and Eletropaulo seeking a declaration that CTEEP is not liable for any debt under the financing agreement. The parties are disputing the proper venue for the CTEEP lawsuit. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In August 2000, the FERC announced an investigation into the organized California wholesale power markets to determine whether rates were just and reasonable. Further investigations involved alleged market manipulation. FERC requested documents from each of the AES Southland, LLC plants and AES Placerita, Inc. AES Southland and AES Placerita have cooperated fully with the FERC investigations. AES Southland was not subject to refund liability because it did not sell into the organized spot markets due to the nature of its tolling agreement. After hearings at FERC, AES Placerita was found subject to refund liability of $588,000 plus interest for spot sales to the California Power Exchange from October 2, 2000 to June 20, 2001. As FERC investigations and hearings progressed, numerous appeals on related issues were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Over the years, the Ninth Circuit issued several opinions that had the potential to expand the scope of the FERC proceedings and increase refund exposure for AES Placerita and other sellers of electricity. Following remand of one of the Ninth Circuit appeals in March 2009, FERC started a new hearing process involving AES Placerita and other sellers. In May 2009, AES Placerita entered into a settlement, approved by FERC in July 2009, concerning the claims before FERC against AES Placerita relating to the California energy crisis of 2000 2001, including the California refund proceeding. Pursuant to the settlement, AES Placerita paid $6 million and assigned a receivable of $168,119 due to it from the California Power Exchange in return for a release of all claims against it at FERC by the settling parties and other consideration. More than 98% of the buyers in the market elected to join the settlement. A small amount of AES Placeritas settlement payment was placed in escrow for buyers that did not join the settlement (non settling parties). It is unclear whether the escrowed funds will be enough to satisfy any additional sums that might be determined to be owed to 98 Table of Contents non settling parties at the conclusion of the FERC proceedings concerning the California energy crisis. However, any such additional sums are expected to be immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2009, one non settling party, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), filed an appeal of the FERCs approval of the settlement which is pending in the Ninth Circuit. SMUDs appeal has been stayed pending further order of the court. The settlement agreement is still effective and will continue to remain effective unless it is vacated by the Ninth Circuit. SMUD has reached a settlement in principal with buyers of electricity that, if approved by FERC, will leave only immaterial claims of non settling parties against AES Placerita. In August 2001, the Grid Corporation of Orissa, India, now Gridco Ltd. (Gridco), filed a petition against the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (CESCO), an affiliate of the Company, with the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC), alleging that CESCO had defaulted on its obligations as an OERC licensed distribution company, that CESCO management abandoned the management of CESCO, and asking for interim measures of protection, including the appointment of an administrator to manage CESCO. Gridco, a state owned entity, is the sole wholesale energy provider to CESCO. Pursuant to the OERCs August 2001 order, the management of CESCO was replaced with a government administrator who was appointed by the OERC. The OERC later held that the Company and other CESCO shareholders were not necessary or proper parties to the OERC proceeding. In August 2004, the OERC issued a notice to CESCO, the Company and others giving the recipients of the notice until November 2004 to show cause why CESCOs distribution license should not be revoked. In response, CESCO submitted a business plan to the OERC. In February 2005, the OERC issued an order rejecting the proposed business plan. The order also stated that the CESCO distribution license would be revoked if an acceptable business plan for CESCO was not submitted to and approved by the OERC prior to March 31, 2005. In its April 2, 2005 order, the OERC revoked the CESCO distribution license. CESCO has filed an appeal against the April 2, 2005 OERC order and that appeal remains pending in the Indian courts. In addition, Gridco asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Companys indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCOs financial obligations to Gridco. In December 2001, Gridco served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limited (AES ODPL), and Jyoti Structures (Jyoti) pursuant to the terms of the CESCO Shareholders Agreement between Gridco, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and CESCO (the CESCO arbitration). In the arbitration, Gridco appeared to be seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by Gridco. The Company counterclaimed against Gridco for damages. In June 2007, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting Gridcos claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to Gridco. The respondents counterclaims were also rejected. In September 2007, Gridco filed a challenge of the arbitration award with the local Indian court. In June 2008, Gridco filed a separate application with the local Indian court for an order enjoining the Company from selling or otherwise transferring its shares in Orissa Power Generation Corporation Ltd.s (OPGC), an equity method investment, and requiring the Company to provide security in the amount of the contested damages in the CESCO arbitration until Gridcos challenge to the arbitration award is resolved. In June 2010, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal awarded the Company some of its costs relating to the arbitration. In August 2010, Gridco filed a challenge of the cost award with the local Indian court. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In early 2002, Gridco made an application to the OERC requesting that the OERC initiate proceedings regarding the terms of OPGCs existing PPA with Gridco. In response, OPGC filed a petition in the Indian courts to block any such OERC proceedings. In early 2005, the Orissa High Court upheld the OERCs jurisdiction to initiate such proceedings as requested by Gridco. OPGC appealed that High Courts decision to the Supreme Court and sought stays of both the High Courts decision and the underlying OERC proceedings regarding the PPAs terms. In April 2005, the Supreme Court granted OPGCs requests and ordered stays of the High Courts decision and the OERC proceedings with respect to the PPAs terms. The matter is awaiting further hearing. 99 Table of Contents Unless the Supreme Court finds in favor of OPGCs appeal or otherwise prevents the OERCs proceedings regarding the PPAs terms, the OERC will likely lower the tariff payable to OPGC under the PPA, which would have an adverse impact on OPGCs financials. OPGC believes that it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In March 2003, the office of the Federal Public Prosecutor for the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (MPF) notified AES Eletropaulo that it had commenced an inquiry related to the BNDES financings provided to AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and the rationing loan provided to Eletropaulo, changes in the control of Eletropaulo, sales of assets by Eletropaulo and the quality of service provided by Eletropaulo to its customers, and requested various documents from Eletropaulo relating to these matters. In July 2004, the MPF filed a public civil lawsuit in the Federal Court of S&atilde;o Paulo (FSCP) alleging that BNDES violated Law 8429/92 (the Administrative Misconduct Act) and BNDESs internal rules by: (1) approving the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (2) extending the payment terms on the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (3) authorizing the sale of Eletropaulos preferred shares at a stock market auction; (4) accepting Eletropaulos preferred shares to secure the loan provided to Eletropaulo; and (5) allowing the restructurings of Light Servi&ccedil;os de Eletricidade S.A. and Eletropaulo. The MPF also named AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s as defendants in the lawsuit because they allegedly benefited from BNDESs alleged violations. In May 2006, the FCSP ruled that the MPF could pursue its claims based on the first, second, and fourth alleged violations noted above. The MPF subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal with the Federal Court of Appeals (FCA) seeking to require the FCSP to consider all five alleged violations. Also, in July 2006, AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s filed an interlocutory appeal with the FCA, which was subsequently consolidated with the MPFs interlocutory appeal, seeking a transfer of venue and to enjoin the FCSP from considering any of the alleged violations. In June 2009, the FCA granted the injunction sought by AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and transferred the case to the Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro. In May 2010, the MPF filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice challenging the transfer. The MPFs lawsuit before the FCSP has been stayed pending a final decision on the interlocutory appeals. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana (the successor of AES Transg&aacute;s) believe they have meritorious defenses to the allegations asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. AES Florestal, Ltd. (Florestal), had been operating a pole factory and had other assets, including a wooded area known as Horto Renner, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (collectively, Property). Florestal had been under the control of AES Sul (Sul) since October 1997, when Sul was created pursuant to a privatization by the Government of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. After it came under the control of Sul, Florestal performed an environmental audit of the entire operational cycle at the pole factory. The audit discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at the pole factory. The audit concluded that the prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia El&eacute;trica (CEEE), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. Sul and Florestal subsequently took the initiative of communicating with Brazilian authorities, as well as CEEE, about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. The Public Attorneys Office has initiated a civil inquiry (Civil Inquiry n. 24/05) to investigate potential civil liability and has requested that the police station of Triunfo institute a police investigation (IP number 1041/05) to investigate potential criminal liability regarding the contamination at the pole factory. The parties filed defenses in response to the civil inquiry. The Public Attorneys Office then requested an injunction which the judge rejected on September 26, 2008. The Public Attorneys office has a right to appeal the decision. The environmental agency (FEPAM) has also started a procedure (Procedure n. 088200567/059) to analyze the measures that shall be taken to contain and remediate the contamination. Also, in March 2000, Sul filed suit against CEEE in the 2nd Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre seeking to register in Suls name the Property that it acquired through the privatization but that remained registered in CEEEs name. During those proceedings, AES subsequently waived its claim to re register the Property and asserted a claim to recover the amounts paid for the Property. That claim is pending. In November 2005, the 7th Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre ruled that the Property must be returned to CEEE. CEEE has had sole possession of Horto Renner since September 2006 and of the rest of the Property since April 2006. In February 2008, Sul 100 Table of Contents and CEEE signed a Technical Cooperation Protocol pursuant to which they requested a new deadline from FEPAM in order to present a proposal. In March 2008, the State Prosecution office filed a Public Class Action against AES Florestal, AES Sul and CEEE, requiring an injunction for the removal of the alleged sources of contamination and the payment of an indemnity in the amount of R$6 million ($4 million). The injunction was rejected and the case is in the evidentiary stage awaiting the judges determination concerning the production of expert evidence. The above referenced proposal was delivered on April 8, 2008. FEPAM responded by indicating that the parties should undertake the first step of the proposal which would be to retain a contractor. In its response, Sul indicated that such step should be undertaken by CEEE as the relevant environmental events resulted from CEEEs operations. It is estimated that remediation could cost approximately R$14.7 million ($9 million). Discussions between Sul and CEEE are ongoing. In January 2004, the Company received notice of a Formulation of Charges filed against the Company by the Superintendence of Electricity of the Dominican Republic. In the Formulation of Charges, the Superintendence asserts that the existence of three generation companies (Empresa Generadora de Electricidad Itabo, S.A. (Itabo), Dominican Power Partners, and AES Andres BV) and one distribution company (Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S.A. (Este)) in the Dominican Republic, violates certain cross ownership restrictions contained in the General Electricity Law of the Dominican Republic. In February 2004, the Company filed in the First Instance Court of the National District of the Dominican Republic an action seeking injunctive relief based on several constitutional due process violations contained in the Formulation of Charges (Constitutional Injunction). In February 2004, the Court granted the Constitutional Injunction and ordered the immediate cessation of any effects of the Formulation of Charges, and the enactment by the Superintendence of Electricity of a special procedure to prosecute alleged antitrust complaints under the General Electricity Law. In March 2004, the Superintendence of Electricity appealed the Courts decision. In July 2004, the Company divested any interest in Este. The Superintendence of Electricitys appeal is pending. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July 2004, the Corporaci&oacute;n Dominicana de Empresas El&eacute;ctricas Estatales (CDEEE) filed lawsuits against Itabo, an affiliate of the Company, in the First and Fifth Chambers of the Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance for the National District. CDEEE alleges in both lawsuits that Itabo spent more than was necessary to rehabilitate two generation units of an Itabo power plant and, in the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, that those funds were paid to affiliates and subsidiaries of AES Gener and Coastal Itabo, Ltd. (Coastal), a former shareholder of Itabo, without the required approval of Itabos board of administration. In the First Chamber lawsuit, CDEEE seeks an accounting of Itabos transactions relating to the rehabilitation. In November 2004, the First Chamber dismissed the case for lack of legal basis. On appeal, in October 2005 the Court of Appeals of Santo Domingo ruled in Itabos favor, reasoning that it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute because the parties contracts mandated arbitration. The Supreme Court of Justice is considering CDEEEs appeal of the Court of Appeals decision. In the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, which also names Itabos former president as a defendant, CDEEE seeks $15 million in damages and the seizure of Itabos assets. In October 2005, the Fifth Chamber held that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute given the arbitration provisions in the parties contracts. The First Chamber of the Court of Appeal ratified that decision in September 2006. In a related proceeding, in May 2005, Itabo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to compel CDEEE to arbitrate its claims. The petition was denied in July 2005. Itabos appeal of that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has been stayed since September 2006. Further, in September 2006, in an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration, an arbitral tribunal determined that it lacked jurisdiction to decide arbitration claims concerning these disputes. Itabo believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In April 2006, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi (District Court) on behalf of certain individual plaintiffs and all residents and or property owners in the State of Mississippi who allegedly suffered harm as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, whose alleged greenhouse gas emissions contributed to alleged global 101 Table of Contents warming which, in turn, allegedly increased the destructive capacity of Hurricane Katrina. The plaintiffs assert unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy/aiding and abetting, public and private nuisance, trespass, negligence, and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment claims against the defendants. The plaintiffs seek damages relating to loss of property, loss of business, clean up costs, personal injuries and death, but do not quantify their alleged damages. In August 2007, the District Court dismissed the case. The plaintiffs subsequently appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which, in October 2009, affirmed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs unjust enrichment, fraudulent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy claims. However, the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence claims, and remanded those claims to the District Court for further proceedings. In February 2010, the Fifth Circuit granted the petitions for en banc rehearing filed by the Company and other defendants, and thereby vacated its October 2009 decision. In May 2010, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had lost its quorum for en banc review. In August 2010, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the U.S. Supreme Court, requesting the Supreme Court to direct the Fifth Circuit to reinstate the appeal and return it to the panel that issued the October 2009 decision. In January 2011, the Supreme Court denied the petition, ending the case. In July 2007, the Competition Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the Competition Committee) ordered Nurenergoservice, an AES subsidiary, to pay approximately KZT 18 billion ($120 million) for alleged antimonopoly violations in 2005 through the first quarter of 2007. The Competition Committees order was affirmed by the economic court in April 2008 (April 2008 Decision). The economic court also issued an injunction to secure Nurenergoservices alleged liability, freezing Nurenergoservices bank accounts and prohibiting Nurenergoservice from transferring or disposing of its property. Nurenergoservices subsequent appeals to the court of appeals were rejected. In February 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency (the Competition Committees successor) seized approximately KZT 783 million ($5 million) from a frozen Nurenergoservice bank account in partial satisfaction of Nurenergoservices alleged damages liability. However, on appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court, in October 2009, the Supreme Court annulled the decisions of the lower courts because of procedural irregularities and remanded the case to the economic court for reconsideration. On remand, in January 2010, the economic court reaffirmed its April 2008 Decision. Nurenergoservices appeals in the court of appeals (first panel) and the court of appeals (second panel) were unsuccessful. Nurenergoservice intends to file a further appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court. In separate but related proceedings, in August 2007, the Competition Committee ordered Nurenergoservice to pay approximately KZT 1.8 billion ($12 million) in administrative fines for its alleged antimonopoly violations. Nurenergoservices appeal to the administrative court was rejected in February 2009. Given the adverse court decisions against Nurenergoservice, the Antimonopoly Agency may attempt to seize Nurenergoservices remaining assets, which are immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Antimonopoly Agency has not indicated whether it intends to assert claims against Nurenergoservice for alleged antimonopoly violations post first quarter 2007. Nurenergoservice believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it; however, there can be no assurances that it will prevail in these proceedings. In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of the power sales of Ust Kamenogorsk HPP (UK HPP) and Shulbinsk HPP, hydroelectric plants under AES concession (collectively, the Hydros), in January through February 2009. The investigation of Shulbinsk HPP is ongoing, but the investigation of UK HPP has been completed. The Antimonopoly Agency determined that UK HPP abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power in January through February 2009. The Agency sought an order from the administrative court requiring UK HPP to pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 120 million ($1 million) and to disgorge profits for the period at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately KZT 440 million ($3 million). No fines or damages have been paid to date, however, as the proceedings in the administrative court have been suspended due to the initiation of related criminal proceedings against officials of UK HPP. The Hydros believe they have meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. 102 Table of Contents In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of Ust Kamenogorsk TETS LLPs (UKT) power sales in 2008 through February 2009. The Antimonopoly Agency subsequently concluded that UKT abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power and should pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 136 million ($1 million). The Antimonopoly Agency later sought an order from the administrative court requiring UKT to pay the fine. The administrative court proceedings have been suspended due to a related criminal investigation of UKT employees. If the investigation is terminated and the Antimonopoly Agency prevails in the administrative proceedings, UKT may be ordered to pay the administrative fine and disgorge the profits from the sales at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately 514 million KZT ($3 million). UKT believes it has meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In December 2007, an arbitral tribunal terminated ESSAs gas supply contracts with members of the Sierra Chata Consortium in light of the restrictions that had been placed on the export of gas by the Argentine Republic. ESSA thereafter terminated its gas transportation contract with Transportadora de Gas del Norte S.A. (TGN), and initiated arbitration seeking relief from the obligation to pay the firm tariff under ESSAs gas transportation contracts with Gasoducto GasAndes (Argentina) S.A. (GasAndes Argentina) and Gasoducto GasAndes S.A. (GasAndes Chile) or in the alternative, termination of such contracts. TGN (which later filed a lawsuit against ESSA in Argentina), GasAndes Argentina, and GasAndes Chile disputed that the restrictions on the export of gas justified the adjustment or termination of the respective gas transportation contracts and sought due tariff payments. On December 29, 2010, ESSA reached settlement agreements with GasAndes Argentina, GasAndes Chile, and TGN terminating the respective gas transportation contracts and resolving all pending legal disputes and potential future claims. ESSA recognized approximately $72 million as other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2010 related to the settlement agreements. Upon termination of the TGN gas transportation contract, ESSA is no longer required to pay certain charges imposed by the Argentine Republic relating to gas supply infrastructure. In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina, Alaska, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, claiming that the defendants alleged GHG emissions have contributed to alleged global warming which, in turn, allegedly has led to the erosion of the plaintiffs alleged land. The plaintiffs assert nuisance and concert of action claims against the Company and the other defendants, and a conspiracy claim against a subset of the other defendants. The plaintiffs seek to recover relocation costs, indicated in the complaint to be from $95 million to $400 million, and other unspecified damages from the defendants. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the District Court granted in October 2009. The plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The parties have briefed the appeal and are awaiting a date for oral argument. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July, 1993 the Public Attorneys office filed a claim against Eletropaulo, the Sao Paulo State Government, SABESP (a state owned company), CETESB (a state owned company) and DAEE (the municipal Water and Electric Energy Department) alleging that they were liable for pollution of the Billings Reservoir as a result of pumping water from the Pinheiros River into the Billings Reservoir. The events in question occurred while Eletropaulo was a state owned company. An initial lower court decision in 2007 found the parties liable for the payment of approximately R$670 million ($401 million) for remediation. Eletropaulo subsequently appealed the decision to the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo which reversed the lower court decision. In 2009, the Public Attorneys Office has filed appeals to both Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) and the Supreme Court (SC) and such appeals were answered by Eletropaulo in the fourth quarter of 2009. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 1996, a public civil action was asserted against Eletropaulo and Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Desportiva Cultural Eletropaulo (the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o) relating to alleged environmental damage caused by construction of the 103 Table of Contents Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o near Guarapiranga Reservoir. The initial decision that was upheld by the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo in 2006 found that Eletropaulo should repair the alleged environmental damage by demolishing certain construction and reforesting the area, and either sponsor an environmental project which would cost approximately R$1 million ($599 thousand) as of December 31, 2010, or pay an indemnification amount of approximately R$10.2 million ($6 million). Eletropaulo has appealed this decision to the Supreme Court and is awaiting a decision. In February 2009, a CAA Section 114 information request from the EPA regarding Cayuga and Somerset was received. The request seeks various operating and testing data and other information regarding certain types of projects at the Cayuga and Somerset facilities, generally for the time period from January 1, 2000 through the date of the information request. This type of information request has been used in the past to assist the EPA in determining whether a plant is in compliance with applicable standards under the CAA. Cayuga and Somerset responded to the EPAs information request in June 2009, and they are awaiting a response from the EPA regarding their submittal. At this time, it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this request may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position. On February 2, 2009, the Cayuga facility received a Notice of Violation from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) that the facility had exceeded the permitted volume limit of coal ash that can be disposed of in the on site landfill. Cayuga has met with NYSDEC and submitted a Landfill Liner Demonstration Report to them. Such report found that the landfill has adequate engineering integrity to support the additional coal ash and there is no inherent environmental threat. NYSDEC has indicated they accept the finding of the report. A permit modification was approved by the NYSDEC on May 14, 2010 and such permit modification allows for closure of this approximately 10 acre portion of the landfill. The construction in accordance with the approved permit modification was completed in November 2010 and the certification report for this construction project is currently being drafted to submit to the NYSDEC in the second quarter of 2011. While at this time it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this matter may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position, based upon the discussions to date, the Company does not believe the impact will be material. In March 2009, AES Uruguaiana Empreendimentos S.A. (AESU) initiated arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against YPF S.A. (YPF) seeking damages and other relief relating to YPFs breach of the parties gas supply agreement (GSA). Thereafter, in April 2009, YPF initiated arbitration in the ICC against AESU and two unrelated parties, Companhia de Gas do Esado do Rio Grande do Sul and Transportador de Gas del Mercosur S.A. (TGM), claiming that AESU wrongfully terminated the GSA and caused the termination of a transportation agreement (TA) between YPF and TGM (YPF Arbitration). YPF seeks an unspecified amount of damages from AESU, a declaration that YPFs performance was excused under the GSA due to certain alleged force majeure events, or, in the alternative, a declaration that the GSA and the TA should be terminated without a finding of liability against YPF because of the allegedly onerous obligations imposed on YPF by those agreements. In addition, in the YPF Arbitration, TGM asserts that if it is determined that AESU is responsible for the termination of the GSA, AESU is liable for TGMs alleged losses, including losses under the TA. The procedural schedules for the arbitrations have been established but the hearing dates have not been scheduled to date. AESU believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit 104 Table of Contents was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. In June 2009, the Inter American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States (IACHR) requested that the Republic of Panama suspend the construction of AES Changuinola S.A.s hydroelectric project (Project) until the bodies of the Inter American human rights system can issue a final decision on a petition (286/08) claiming that the construction violates the human rights of alleged indigenous communities. In July 2009, Panama responded by informing the IACHR that it would not suspend construction of the Project and requesting that the IACHR revoke its request. In June 2010, the Inter American Court of Human Rights vacated the IACHRs request. With respect to the merits of the underlying petition, the IACHR heard arguments by the communities and Panama in November 2009, but has not issued a decision to date. The Company cannot predict Panamas response to any determination on the merits of the petition by the bodies of the Inter American human rights system. In July 2009, AES Energ&iacute;a Cartagena S.R.L. (AES Cartagena) received notices from the Spanish national energy regulator, Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de Energ&iacute;a (CNE), stating that the proceeds of the sale of electricity from AES Cartagenas plant should be reduced by roughly the value of the CO2 allowances that were granted to AES Cartagena for free for the years 2007, 2008, and the first half of 2009. In particular, the notices stated that CNE intended to invoice AES Cartagena to recover that value, which CNE calculated as approximately 20 million ($27 million) for 2007 2008 and an amount to be determined for the first half of 2009. In September 2009, AES Cartagena received invoices for 523,548 (approximately $694,000) for the allowances granted for free for 2007 and 19,907,248 (approximately $26 million) for 2008. In July 2010, AES Cartagena received an invoice for approximately 5.4 million ($7 million) for the allowances granted for free for the first half of 2009. AES Cartagena does not expect to be charged for CO2 allowances issued free of charge for subsequent periods. AES Cartagena has paid the amounts invoiced and has filed challenges to the CNEs demands in the Spanish judicial system. There can be no assurances that the challenges will be successful. AES Cartagena has demanded indemnification from its fuel supply and electricity toller, GDF Suez, in relation to the CNE invoices under the long term energy agreement (the Energy Agreement) with GDF Suez. However, GDF Suez has disputed that it is responsible for the CNE invoices under the Energy Agreement. Therefore, in September 2009, AES Cartagena initiated arbitration against GDF Suez, seeking to recover the payments made to CNE. In the arbitration, AES Cartagena also seeks a determination that GDF Suez is responsible for procuring and bearing the cost of CO2 allowances that are required to offset the CO2 emissions of AES Cartagenas power plant, which is also in dispute between the parties. To date, AES Cartagena has paid approximately 20 million ($27 million) for the CO2 allowances that have been required to offset 2008 and 2009 CO2 emissions. AES Cartagena expects that allowances will need to be purchased to offset emissions for subsequent years. The evidentiary hearing in the arbitration took place from May 31 June 4, 2010, and closing arguments were heard on September 1, 2010. In February 2011, the arbitral tribunal requested further briefing from the parties on certain issues in the arbitration. If AES Cartagena does not prevail in the arbitration and is required to bear the cost of carbon compliance, its results of operations could be materially adversely affected and, in turn, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company and its results of operations. AES Cartagena believes it has meritorious claims and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 2009, the Public Defenders Office of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (PDO) filed a class action against AES Sul in the 16th District Court of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (District Court), claiming that AES Sul has been illegally passing PIS and COFINS taxes (taxes based on AES Suls income) to consumers. According to ANEELs Order No. 93/05, the federal laws of Brazil, and the Brazilian Constitution, energy companies such as AES Sul are entitled to highlight PIS and COFINS taxes in power bills to final consumers, as the cost of those taxes is included in the energy tariffs that are applicable to final consumers. Before AES Sul had 105 Table of Contents been served with the action, the District Court dismissed the lawsuit in October 2009 on the ground that AES Sul had been properly highlighting PIS and COFINS taxes in consumer bills in accordance with Brazilian law. In April 2010, the PDO appealed to the Appellate Court of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (AC). In November 2010, the AC affirmed the dismissal. The PDO is expected to appeal. If the dismissal is ever reversed and AES Sul does not prevail in the lawsuit and is ordered to cease recovering PIS and COFINS taxes pursuant to its energy tariff, its potential prospective losses could be approximately R$9.6 million ($6 million) per month, as estimated by AES Sul. In addition, if AES Sul is ordered to reimburse consumers, its potential retrospective liability could be approximately R$1.2 billion ($718 million), as estimated by AES Sul. AES Sul believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings if it is served with the action; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in its efforts. Furthermore, if AES Sul does not prevail in the litigation it will seek to adjust its energy tariff to compensate it for its losses, but there can be no assurances that it would be successful in obtaining an adjusted energy tariff. In October 2009, IPL received a Notice of Violation (NOV) and Finding of Violation from EPA pursuant to CAA Section 113(a). The NOV alleges violations of the CAA at IPLs three coal fired electric generating facilities dating back to 1986. The alleged violations primarily pertain to EPAs Prevention of Significant Deterioration and nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) requirements under the CAA. Since receiving the letter, IPL management has met with EPA staff and is currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of similar cases have required companies to pay civil penalties and to install additional pollution control technology on coal fired electric generating units. A similar outcome in this case could have a material impact to IPL and could, in turn, have a material impact on the Company. IPL would seek recovery through customer rates of any operating or capital expenditures related to pollution control technology systems to reduce regulated air emissions; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in that regard. In November 2009, April 2010 and December 2010, substantially similar personal injury lawsuits were filed by a total of 26 residents and estates in the Dominican Republic against the Company, AES Atlantis, Inc., AES Puerto Rico, LP, AES Puerto Rico, Inc., and AES Puerto Rico Services, Inc., in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware. In each lawsuit the plaintiffs allege that the coal combustion byproducts of AES Puerto Ricos power plant were illegally placed in the Dominican Republic in October 2003 through March 2004 and subsequently caused the plaintiffs birth defects, other personal injuries, and or deaths. The plaintiffs do not quantify their alleged damages, but generally allege that they are entitled to compensatory and punitive damages. The AES defendants have moved for partial dismissal of both the November 2009 and April 2010 lawsuits on various grounds. (The AES Defendants have until mid February to respond to the December 2010 lawsuit.) In September 2010, the Superior Court heard arguments on the motions. The Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs fraud allegations without prejudice to replead, and the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in November 2010. The AES defendants have filed a renewed motion to dismiss the amended issues. The remaining claims (other than fraud) addressed in the AES defendants original motion to dismiss are still pending. The AES defendants believe they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. On December 21, 2010, AES 3C Maritza East 1 EOOD, which owns an unfinished 670MW lignite fired power plant in Bulgaria, made the first in a series of demands on the performance bond securing the construction Contractors obligations under the parties EPC Contract. The Contractor failed to complete the plant on schedule. The total amount demanded by Maritza under the performance bond is approximately 155 million ($205 million). However, the Contractor obtained a temporary injunction from a French court preventing the issuing bank from honoring the bond demands. As the performance bond is governed by English law, Maritza obtained a judgment from an English court that the bond should be paid, and then presented this judgment to the French court which issued the temporary injunction. However, on February 10, 2011, the French court issued a decision enjoining the issuing bank from honoring the demands on the performance bond pending the determination of the arbitration between Maritza and the Contractor, described below. Maritza is attempting to 106 Table of Contents lift that injunction or otherwise obtain payment on its demands. In addition, in December 2010, the Contractor issued a notice of dispute alleging that the lignite that has been supplied by Maritza for commissioning of the power plant is out of specification, allegedly entitling the Contractor to an extension of time to complete the power plant, an increase to the contract price of approximately 62 million ($82 million), and other relief. The Contractor thereafter advised Maritza that it had stopped commissioning of the power plants two units because of the characteristics of the lignite supplied, and, in January 2011, initiated arbitration on its lignite claim. Maritza disputes that the lignite is out of specification and intends to defend the arbitration and assert counterclaims for delay liquidated damages and other relief relating to the Contractors failure to complete the power plant and other breaches of the EPC contract. Maritza believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. ITEM 4. REMOVED AND RESERVED 107 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On March 12, 2010, the Company and Terrific Investment Corporation (Investor), a wholly owned subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, entered into a stockholder agreement (the Stockholder Agreement) in connection with the agreement discussed in the following paragraph. Under the Stockholder Agreement, as long as Investor holds more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, Investor will have the right to designate one nominee, who must be reasonably acceptable to the Board, for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. Investor has not designated its nominee for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, until such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock, Investor has agreed to vote its shares in accordance with the recommendation of the Company on any matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company relating to the election of directors and compensation matters. Otherwise, Investor may vote its shares at its discretion. Further, under the Stockholder Agreement, Investor will be subject to a standstill restriction which generally prohibits Investor from purchasing additional securities of the Company beyond the level acquired by it under the stock purchase agreement entered into between Investor and the Company on November 6, 2009. In addition, Investor has agreed to a lock up restriction such that Investor would not sell its shares for a period of 12 months following the closing, subject to certain exceptions. The standstill and lock up restrictions also terminate at such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock. Investor will have certain registration rights and preemptive rights under the Stockholder Agreement with respect to its shares of common stock of the Company. On March 15, 2010, the Company completed the sale of 125,468,788 shares of common stock to Investor. The shares were sold for $12.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.58 billion. Investors ownership in the Companys common stock is now approximately 15% of the Companys total outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers In July 2010, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $500 million of AES common stock. The Board authorization permits the Company to repurchase stock through a variety of methods, including open market repurchases and or privately negotiated transactions. The original authorization was set to expire on December 31, 2010, however; in December 2010, the Board authorized an extension of the stock repurchase program. There can be no assurance as to the amount, timing or prices of repurchases, which may vary based on market conditions and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2010, shares of common stock repurchased under this plan totaled 8,382,825 at a total cost of $99 million plus a nominal amount of commissions (average of $11.86 per share including commissions). There was $401 million remaining under the stock repurchase program available for future repurchases at December 31, 2010. 108 Table of Contents The following table presents information regarding purchases made by The AES Corporation of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2010: Repurchase Period Total Numberof SharesPurchased Average PricePaid per Share Total Number of SharesRepurchased as Partof a Publicly AnnouncedRepurchase Plan Dollar Value of MaximumNumber of Shares To BePurchased Under the Plan 10/1/10 10/31/10 6,086,345 $ 12.30 6,086,345 $ 409,713,649 11/1/10 11/30/10 $ $ 409,713,649 12/1/10 12/31/10 755,000 $ 11.89 755,000 $ 400,732,931 Total 6,841,345 $ 12.26 6,841,345 Market Information Our common stock is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol AES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business We are a global power company. We operate two primary lines of business. The first is our Generation business, where we own and or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities, other intermediaries and certain end users. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our Generation and Utilities businesses comprised approximately 45% and 55% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We are also continuing to expand our wind and solar generation businesses. These initiatives are not material contributors to our operating results at this time, but we believe that certain of these initiatives may become material in the future. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10 K. Our Organization and Segments. Our management reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively EMEA), each managed by a regional president. The financial reporting segment structure uses our management reporting structure as its foundation and reflects how we manage the business internally. Based on our application of the segment reporting accounting guidance, which provides certain quantitative thresholds and aggregation criteria, we have concluded that the Company has the following six reportable segments: Latin America Generation; Latin America Utilities; North America Generation; North America Utilities; Europe Generation; Asia Generation. We report the Companys Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation, Wind Generation and Climate Solutions operating segments within Corporate and Other because they do not meet the criteria to allow for aggregation with another operating segment or the quantitative thresholds that would require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. None of these operating segments are currently material to our financial statement presentation of reportable segments, individually or in the aggregate. Corporate and Other also includes corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments and other intercompany charges such as self insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company modified its internal reporting structure to move the management of the Companys generation business in Jordan, Amman East, from Asia to Europe. Accordingly, Amman East is now reported within the Europe Generation segment. All prior periods have been retrospectively restated to reflect this change and conform to current period presentation. Key Drivers of Our Results of Operations. Our Generation and Utilities businesses are distinguished by the nature of their customers, operational differences, cost structure, regulatory environment and risk exposure. As a result, each line of business has slightly different drivers which affect operating results. Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other things, plant reliability and efficiency, power prices, volume, 113 Table of Contents management of fixed and variable operating costs, management of working capital including collection of receivables, and the extent to which our plants have hedged their exposure to currency and commodities such as fuel. For our Generation businesses which sell power under short term contracts or in the spot market, the most crucial factors are the current market price of electricity and the marginal costs of production. Growth in our Generation business is largely tied to securing new PPAs, expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building or acquiring new power plants. Performance drivers for our Utilities businesses include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; management of working capital, including collection of receivables; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive regulatory requirements; and in developing countries, reduction of commercial and technical losses. The operating results of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth and weather conditions in areas in which they operate. In addition to these drivers, as further explained below, the Company also has exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. One of the key factors which affect our Generation business is our ability to enter into contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of fuel used to produce that electricity. Long term contracts are intended to reduce exposure to volatility associated with fuel prices in the market and the price of electricity by fixing the revenue and costs for these businesses. The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. In turn, most of these businesses enter into long term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. While these long term contractual agreements reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel, the predictability of operating results and cash flows vary by business based on the extent to which a facilitys generation capacity and fuel requirements are contracted and the negotiated terms of these agreements. Entering into these contracts exposes us to counterparty credit risk. For further discussion of these risks, see Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. When fuel costs increase, many of our businesses are able to pass these costs on to their customers. Generation businesses with long term contracts in place do this by including fuel pass through or fuel indexing arrangements in their contracts. Utilities businesses can pass costs on to their customers through increases in current or future tariff rates. Therefore, in a rising fuel cost environment, the increased fuel costs for these businesses often result in an increase in revenue to the extent these costs can be passed through (though not necessarily on a one for one basis). Conversely, in a declining fuel cost environment, the decreased fuel costs can result in a decrease in revenue. Increases or decreases in revenue at these businesses that have the ability to pass through costs to the customer have a corresponding impact on cost of sales, to the extent the costs can be passed through, resulting in a limited impact on gross margin, if any. Although these circumstances may not have a large impact on gross margin, they can significantly affect gross margin as a percentage of revenue. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of revenue is a less relevant measure when evaluating our operating performance. To the extent our businesses are unable to pass through fuel cost increases to their customers, gross margin may be adversely affected. Global diversification also helps us mitigate risk. Our presence in mature markets helps mitigate the exposure associated with our businesses in emerging markets. Additionally, our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, water (hydroelectric power), wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. However, to the extent the mix of fuel sources enabling our generation capabilities in any one market is not diversified, the spread in costs of different fuels or the availability of natural resources such as water for hydroelectric power production or wind may also influence the operating performance and the ability of our subsidiaries to compete within that market. For example, in a market where gas prices fall to a low level compared to coal prices, power prices may be set by low gas prices which can affect the profitability of our coal plants in that market. In certain cases, we may attempt to hedge fuel prices to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, we only hedge a 114 Table of Contents portion of our currency and commodity risks, and our businesses are still subject to these risks, as further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. Commodity and power price volatility could continue to impact our financial metrics to the extent this volatility is not hedged. For a discussion of our sensitivities to commodity, currency and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Form 10 K. Due to our global presence, the Company has significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure is primarily associated with the impact of the translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results from their local currency to U.S. Dollars that is required for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, there is foreign currency transaction exposure when an entity enters into transactions, including debt agreements, in currencies other than their functional currency. These risks are further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. During 2010, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a significant impact on our operating results. If the current foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues, our gross margin and other financial metrics could continue to be affected. Another key driver of our results is our ability to bring new businesses into commercial operation successfully. We currently have approximately 1,300 MW of projects under construction in eight countries. Our prospects for improved operating results and cash flows are dependent upon successful completion of these projects on time and within budget. However, as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties, construction is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with site identification, financing, permitting and our ability to meet construction deadlines. Delays or the inability to complete projects and commence commercial operations can result in increased costs, impairment of assets and other challenges involving partners and counterparties to our construction agreements, PPAs and other agreements. Our gross margin is also impacted by the fact that in each country in which we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity, and environmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business. Regulations differ on a country by country basis (and even at the state and local municipality levels) and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country, and affect many aspects of our operations and development projects. Our ability to negotiate tariffs, enter into long term contracts, pass through costs related to capital expenditures and otherwise navigate these regulations can have an impact on our revenue, costs and gross margin. Environmental and land use regulations, including existing and proposed regulation of GHG emissions, could substantially increase our capital expenditures or other compliance costs, which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. For a further discussion of the Regulatory Environment, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments Environmental, included in Item 8. Financial Statements, Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated with Government Regulation and Laws of this Form 10 K. Key Drivers of Results in 2010 In 2010, the Companys gross margin and cash flow from operations increased $531 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, while net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million compared to the prior year. During 2010, our North American generation businesses continued to face challenges associated with relatively lower gas prices and a decline in power prices relative to coal and other fuel. In particular, lower gas and power prices have affected the generation volume and financial results of our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas which are merchant businesses and not subject to PPAs. We expect 115 Table of Contents this trend to continue. In 2010, these challenges were partially mitigated by hedging arrangements. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Impairments below. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Despite these challenges, many of our financial measures have improved when compared to 2009. Gross margin increased due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation caused by a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies in 2010 and better operating performance at certain businesses. For instance, certain of the Companys Latin American businesses experienced continued increases in market demand due to the local economic recovery in Latin America. The Company also benefited from higher demand and favorable market conditions at Masinloc, our generation business in the Philippines. Masinlocs higher availability enabled the Company to benefit from increased contract and spot market sales and favorable market prices in the Philippines. In addition, cash provided by operating activities increased due to the improved operating results at Latin America generation businesses and Masinloc; contributions from the consolidation of Cartagena and the Ballylumford acquisition in 2010; and changes in working capital in Latin America. Despite the increase in gross margin in 2010, net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased primarily from the impact of long lived asset impairments recognized related to four businesses: Eastern Energy in New York, Southland in California, Tisza II in Hungary and Deepwater in Texas. These were partially offset by gains from the sale of our discontinued businesses in Oman and Qatar and a decrease in goodwill impairment charges. In 2011, we expect to face continued challenges in our business, including the trends in North America described above. In addition, the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and commodity prices on our operations may continue into 2011. In 2011, the components of the tariff reset in Brazil and its potential impact on our Brazilian utilities are uncertain at this time and we expect continued challenges in our merchant businesses such as those in the U.S., Hungary and Northern Ireland. However, management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses and growth from new businesses acquired, that commenced operations in 2010 or are expected to commence operations in 2011, may lessen or offset the impact of these challenges described above, as they did in 2010. However, if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described above or elsewhere in this section impact us more than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our gross margin and net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In addition, we do not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. Such cash flows may be influenced by the operating challenges presented above and will also not include the cash flows from operations which were sold in 2010 or the increases experienced from the cash flows provided by the initial consolidation of Cartagena, the acquisition of Ballylumford and several working capital transactions at our Latin American utilities in 2010 as discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity. The following briefly describes the key changes in our reported revenue, gross margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, Adjusted Earnings per Share (a non GAAP measure) and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Results of Operations and Segment Analysis discussion within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. 116 Table of Contents Performance Highlights Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 Gross Margin $ 3,964 $ 3,433 $ 3,568 Net Income Attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share from Continuing Operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (a non GAAP measure)(1) $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 3,510 $ 2,202 $ 2,160 (1) See reconciliation and definition below under Non GAAP Measure. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue increased $2.7 billion, or 19%, to $16.6 billion in 2010 compared with $14.0 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $805 million; increased volume and rates at our Brazilian utilities attributable to increased demand due to the recovery of the local economy and the favorable impact of the June 2009 tariff reset; the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010; the favorable impact of rates at our generation businesses in Argentina; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; higher demand at Gener in Chile; the impact of the Companys new business in Northern Ireland, acquired in August 2010; and higher demand and rates at Indianapolis Power and Light. Gross margin increased $531 million, or 15%, to $4.0 billion in 2010 compared with $3.4 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $219 million; an increase in demand at our generation and utilities businesses in Latin America; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; and the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs in Latin America, largely driven by bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil in 2009 that did not recur; and lower rates at our generation businesses in New York. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million to $9 million in 2010, compared to $658 million in 2009. Key drivers of the decrease included: Impairment losses in New York related to our Eastern Energy facilities, in California related to our Southland (Huntington Beach) generation facility, in Hungary related to our Tisza II generation facility and in Texas related to our Deepwater facility; 117 Table of Contents A decrease in gain on sale of investments due to the sale of our businesses in Northern Kazakhstan which occurred in 2009; and A decrease in other income due to the reduction in interest and penalties in 2009 associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the Programa de Recuperacao Fiscal (REFIS) program and a favorable court decision in 2009 enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by: The gain on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of Barka which occurred in August 2010; An increase in net equity in earnings of affiliates partially offset by income tax expense related to the sale of the Companys indirect investment in Companhia Energ&eacute;tica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Lower impairment expenses related to a goodwill impairment of our business in Kilroot that occurred in 2009; Lower income tax expense due to 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries; and An increase in gross margin as described above. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion, or 59%, to $3.5 billion in 2010 compared with $2.2 billion in 2009. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $837 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased tax payments in 2009 associated with a tax amnesty program of $326 million, higher working capital requirements during 2009 related to payments on the settlement of swap agreements of $65 million and in 2010, a $50 million decrease in employer contributions to pension plans and lower payments for contingencies; an increase of $215 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to the higher gross margin in 2010 combined with improved working capital mainly as a result of higher collections of value added taxes and accounts receivable; an increase of $99 million at Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher gross margin; and an increase of $58 million as a result of our consolidation of Cartagena in 2010 and the acquisition of Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $136 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations of businesses sold in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of businesses sold was $33 million and will not recur in 2011. In 2010 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities at our Latin American Utilities businesses included several items such as the tax amnesty program and settlement of swap agreements, as described above, that are not expected to recur. In addition, 2010 net cash provided by operating activities benefited from the one time cash savings related to the utilization of tax credits received as a result of the REFIS program. As such, the Company does not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. 118 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue decreased $1.2 billion, or 8%, to $14.0 billion in 2009 compared with $15.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $997 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; decreases in volume at Uruguaiana due to the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold, as well as in New York and Hungary and lower dispatch in Northern Ireland due to unfavorable gas prices compared to coal; the impact of lower spot and contract energy prices at our generation business in Chile; and lower energy prices and volume at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase in tariff rates at our utilities businesses in Latin America primarily reflecting the recovery of energy purchases that were passed through to our customers. Gross margin decreased $135 million, or 4%, to $3.4 billion in 2009 compared with $3.6 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $218 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; lower energy prices and higher purchased energy costs at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic and Argentina; increased pension costs in Brazil and the U.S.; and lower volume in New York due to lower spot market rates. These decreases were partially offset by: improved operating performance at our generation businesses in Chile and the Philippines; higher tariffs in Brazil and El Salvador; and bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $576 million to $658 million in 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: a gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Northern Kazakhstan partially offset by a performance incentive bonus recognized in 2009 for management services provided to these subsidiaries and a settlement upon termination of the management agreement in 2009; the reduction in gross margin in 2009 as described above; and higher impairment expenses in 2009 as a result of an impairment of goodwill at Kilroot in Northern Ireland, and an impairment recognized on our assets in Pakistan which is reflected in discontinued operations, offset by a decline in long lived asset impairment compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by: a reduction in foreign currency transaction losses on net monetary position as a result of reduced losses at our businesses in Chile and the Philippines; a reduction in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates and debt balances in Brazil and favorable foreign currency translation; and lower income tax expenses driven in part by lower pre tax income and a decrease in the effective tax rate from 29% in 2008 to 26% in 2009 due, in part, to tax benefits recorded in 2009 upon the release of 119 Table of Contents valuation allowances at U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recognized in Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. In 2008, the $905 million gain recognized on the sale of our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses had a significant impact on net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In 2009, the Company recognized a performance incentive bonus of $80 million in the first quarter for management services provided to these sold businesses, reflected as other income. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized an additional gain on the sale of the businesses of $98.5 million upon the termination of the management agreement. While the Company engages in the sale of assets and businesses from time to time, the gain or loss recognized in any such sale will depend on a number of factors related to the asset or business that may be sold. Therefore, the Company does not believe that the decline in net income between 2008 and 2009 represents a trend. All of the amounts related to our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses were reported in continuing operations and will not recur in 2010 or future years. Net cash from operating activities increased $42 million, or 2%, to $2.2 billion in 2009 compared with $2.2 billion in 2008. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $238 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to improved working capital management; an increase of $148 million at our Asia Generation businesses due to improved working capital management and improved gross margin; and an increase of $115 million at our Europe Generation businesses primarily due to the collection of the $80 million Kazakhstan management performance incentive bonus in the first quarter 2009. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $391 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased working capital requirements, including the payment of the settlement of a swap agreement, increased tax payments associated with a tax amnesty program and increased payments related to the settlement of contingencies and energy purchases, partially offset by increased operating results; and a decrease of $77 million at our North America Generation businesses, primarily due to reduced operating results. Non GAAP Measure We define adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) mark to market amounts related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) significant gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) significant losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. AES believes that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Companys internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to mark to market gains or losses related to derivative transactions, currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.11 per share. For purposes of measuring loss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be antidilutive.

Managements Priorities Management continues to focus on the following priorities: Execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy including funds received in 2010 from asset and equity sales: investing in value accretive projects; delevering to increase financial flexibility, reduce risk and to create future borrowing capacity; and executing its stock repurchase program; from July through December 2010 we have repurchased a total of $99 million, or approximately 8.4 million shares of AES common stock, at an average price per share of $11.86, including commissions. Improvement of operations in the existing portfolio; Achieve cost savings through the alignment of overhead costs with business requirements, systems automation and optimal allocation of business development spending; Strategic portfolio management of existing projects including restructuring and potential sales of certain North American generation subsidiaries; Completion of an approximately 1,300 MW active construction program on time and within budget; Achieving commercial operation at Maritza in Bulgaria. At the end of 2010, the Company experienced certain commissioning delays, as further described in Key Trends and Uncertainties Development below; and 122 Table of Contents Integration of new projects. During 2010, the following projects were acquired or commenced commercial operations: Project Location Fuel GrossMW AES Equity Interest(Percent, Rounded) Ballylumford United Kingdom Gas 1,246 100 % JHRH(1) China Hydro 379 35 % Nueva Ventanas Chile Coal 272 71 % St. Nikola Bulgaria Wind 156 89 % Guacolda 4(2) Chile Coal 152 35 % Dong Qi(3) China Wind 49 49 % Huanghua II(3) China Wind 49 49 % St. Patrick France Wind 35 100 % North Rhins Scotland Wind 22 100 % Kepezkaya Turkey Hydro 28 51 % Damlapinar(4) Turkey Hydro 16 51 % (1) Jianghe Rural Electrification Development Co.

Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Some of these challenges are also described above in Key Drivers of Results in 2010. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. Development. During the past year, the Company has successfully acquired and completed construction of a number of projects, totaling approximately 2,404 MW, including the acquisition of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom and completion of construction of a number of projects in Europe, Chile and China. However, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties of this Form 10 K, our development projects are subject to uncertainties. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not yet begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, we believe that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this time frame. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results or financial position. Global Economic Conditions. During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Although the economic conditions in several of these countries have improved in recent months, our businesses could be impacted in the event these recent trends do not continue. 123 Table of Contents Our business or results of operations could be impacted if our subsidiaries are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all, are unable to raise funds through the sale of assets or are otherwise unable to finance or refinance their activities. The Company could also be adversely affected if capital market disruptions result in increased borrowing costs (including with respect to interest payments on the Companys or our subsidiaries variable rate debt) or if commodity prices affect the profitability of our plants or their ability to continue operations. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if general economic or political conditions in the markets where our subsidiaries operate deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the availability and or an increase in the cost of capital, or if the value of our assets remain depressed or decline further. Any of the foregoing events or a combination thereof could have a material impact on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, financial covenants, and or its credit rating. Our subsidiaries are subject to credit risk, which includes risk related to the ability of counterparties (such as parties to our PPAs, fuel supply agreements, hedging agreements and other contractual arrangements) to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price or to satisfy their financial or other contractual obligations. The Company has not suffered any material effects related to its counterparties during 2010. However, if macroeconomic conditions impact our counterparties, they may be unable to meet their commitments which could result in the loss of favorable contractual positions, which could have a material impact on our business. In addition, during the past year, certain European countries have faced a sovereign debt crisis and it is possible that other nations could be affected. This crisis has resulted in an increased risk of default by governments and the implementation of austerity measures in countries. If the crisis continues, worsens, or spreads, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company. Our businesses may be impacted if they are unable to access the capital markets, face increased taxes or labor costs, or if governments fail to fulfill their obligations to us or adopt austerity measures which adversely impact our projects. In addition, as noted in the Risk Factor entitled, Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges, our renewables businesses are dependent on favorable regulatory incentives, including subsidies, which are provided by sovereign governments. If these subsidies or other incentives are reduced or repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, in whole or in part, this could impact the ability of the affected businesses to continue to grow their operations. For example, the Spanish government recently issued a decree which limits the feed in tariff and number of photovoltaic hours eligible for the tariff, which could adversely impact AES Solar in Spain. For further information on the decree see Item 1. Regulatory Spain of this Form 10 K. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries. For further information on the importance of long term contracts and our counterparty credit risk, see the Risk Factor from this Form 10 K titled, We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. As a result of any of the foregoing events, we may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. The Companys investment in AES Solar, whose primary operations are in Europe, at December 31, 2010 was $312 million. For a discussion of the risks associated with commodity prices, see We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. It is also possible that commodity or power price volatility could continue to impact our financial results. As noted in Key Drivers of Results in 2010, and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk of this Form 10 K, the Companys North American businesses continue to face pressure as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place, but purchase 124 Table of Contents fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. If these conditions continue or worsen, these businesses may need to restructure their obligations or seek additional funding (including from the Parent) or face the possibility that they may be unable to meet their obligations and continue operations. Presently, Eastern Energy, Deepwater and Thames are seeking to restructure their financial obligations and or place certain of their plants in protective layup status to mitigate operating risks caused by high fuel costs and other competitive pressures. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. The Company presently manages its commodity risk with hedging activities to mitigate earnings volatility. However, at present in North America, dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present an opportunity to engage in additional hedging activity for 2011. As a result, there are hedging arrangements in place for only a relatively small portion of 2011. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. Specifically, the operating results of the Companys Eastern Energy generation business in New York could be adversely impacted by continued higher coal prices relative to electricity prices if hedging continues to be uneconomic. If global economic conditions worsen, it could also affect the rates we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our rates based on prevailing market conditions as PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual rate or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. Impairments. Long lived assets. The global economic conditions and other adverse factors discussed above heighten the risk of a significant asset impairment. Examples of conditions that could be indicative of impairment which would require us to evaluate the recovery of a long lived asset or asset group include: current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset group; a significant adverse change in legal factors, including changes in environmental or other regulations or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used or in its physical condition. As further described in Item 1. Regulatory Matters United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR) had the right to require the termination of the long term PPAs under which Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom, supplies electricity to NIE Energy as early as 2010. One of the conditions to the early termination was 180 days notice, which was provided to Kilroot on April 30, 2010. At March 31, 2010, management evaluated Kilroots long lived assets for potential impairment assuming the early termination of the PPA and concluded that no impairment existed at that time. On October 28, 2010, Kilroot received final notice from NIAUR directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the PPA effective November 1, 2010. Kilroot may not be able to replace the contract on competitive terms and, upon cancellation of the PPA effective November 1, 2010, became a merchant plant. It will operate under the gross mandatory pool of the SEM in Northern Ireland. There have been no additional impairment indicators since March 31, 2010. AES Eastern Energy (AEE) operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. 125 Table of Contents The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated an impairment evaluation of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW petroleum coke (pet coke) fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and a recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 126 Table of Contents 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time, since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and what form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations. This was considered as an impairment indicator for the long lived asset groups. The recoverability test of the long lived asset groups indicated that the carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group exceeded its fair value by $200 million which was recognized as an impairment expense. The carrying amounts of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach long lived asset groups were determined to be recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis at September 30, 2010 and no impairment was necessary. During the third quarter of 2010, we also recognized impairment on the long lived assets at our Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. Tisza II operates under an annual contract with an off taker. In the third quarter of 2010, when Tisza II began the negotiation of its 2011 contract, future undiscounted cash flows of the plant were no longer expected to recover the long lived assets groups carrying amount due to prevailing market rates, higher generation costs and lower demand expectations. Accordingly, the Company measured the fair value of the long lived asset group and recorded an impairment expense of $85 million, representing the excess of carrying amount over the fair value at September 30, 2010. Goodwill. The Company seeks business acquisitions as one of its growth strategies. We have achieved significant growth in the past as a result of several business acquisitions, which also resulted in the recognition of goodwill. As noted in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, there is always a risk that Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. The benefits of goodwill are typically realized through the future operating results of an acquired business. Management believes that the recoverability of goodwill is positively correlated with the economic environments in which our acquired businesses operate and a severe economic downturn could negatively impact the recoverability of goodwill. Also, the evolving environmental regulations, including GHG regulations, around the globe continue to increase the operating costs of our generation businesses. In extreme situations, the environmental regulations could even make a once profitable business uneconomical. In addition, most of our generation businesses have a finite life and as the acquired businesses reach the end of their finite lives, the carrying amount of goodwill is gradually recovered through their periodic operating results. The accounting guidance, however, prohibits the systematic amortization of goodwill and rather requires an annual impairment evaluation. Thus, as some of our acquired businesses approach the end of their finite lives, they may incur goodwill impairment charges even if there are no discrete adverse changes in the economic environment. As noted in Long lived assets above, adverse market conditions at Deepwater were also considered an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. Accordingly, in the second and third quarters of 2010, interim 127 Table of Contents goodwill impairment evaluations were performed at the Deepwater reporting unit level. The reporting unit passed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation in the second quarter and no impairment was recognized. In the third quarter, however, the reporting unit failed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation. Upon measurement of impairment loss in Step 2, the entire $18 million goodwill balance was considered impaired and recognized as goodwill impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation and did not have any reporting units that were considered at risk. A reporting unit is considered at risk when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. While there were no potential impairment indicators that could result in the recognition of goodwill impairment for any of these reporting units, it is possible we may incur goodwill impairment on these reporting units in future years if any of the following events occur: a significant adverse change in business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a sale of assets at less than carrying amount, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, an acquisition not performing as expected, changing environmental regulations that significantly increase the cost of doing business, or a business reaches the end of its finite life. The likelihood of the occurrence of these events may increase because of the challenging global macroeconomic conditions. Regulatory Environment. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter and mercury. For a description of material regulations faced by the Company, see Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies and Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows set forth in this Form 10 K. Recent Events Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company continued to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program announced on July 7, 2010. The Company has repurchased 1,026,610 shares at a cost of $13 million in 2011, bringing the cumulative total through February 22, 2010 to 9,409,435 shares at a total cost of $112 million (average price of $11.92 per share including commissions). As of February 25, 2011, $388 million of the $500 million authorized remained available under the stock repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 14 Equity. On February 1, 2011, AES Thames, LLC (Thames), our 208 MW coal fired plant in Connecticut, filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy is due, in part, to the increased cost of energy production. The bankruptcy protection is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or the results of operations. 128 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, Results of operations 2010 2009 2008 $ change2010 vs. 2009 $ change2009 vs. 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: Latin America Generation $ 4,281 $ 3,651 $ 4,468 $ 630 $ (817 ) Latin America Utilities 7,222 6,092 5,907 1,130 185 North America Generation 1,972 1,940 2,234 32 (294 ) North America Utilities 1,145 1,068 1,079 77 (11 ) Europe Generation 1,362 820 1,143 542 (323 ) Asia Generation 618 375 345 243 30 Corporate and Other(1) 1,066 870 1,012 196 (142 ) Eliminations(2) (1,019 ) (862 ) (991 ) (157 ) 129 Total Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 $ 2,693 $ (1,243 ) Gross Margin: Latin America Generation $ 1,497 $ 1,357 $ 1,398 $ 140 $ (41 ) Latin America Utilities 1,072 918 886 154 32 North America Generation 435 477 660 (42 ) (183 ) North America Utilities 249 239 261 10 (22 ) Europe Generation 268 212 273 56 (61 ) Asia Generation 240 93 (10 ) 147 103 Corporate and Other(3) 186 117 62 69 55 Eliminations(4) 17 20 38 (3 ) (18 ) General and administrative expenses (392 ) (339 ) (368 ) (53 ) 29 Interest expense (1,526 ) (1,485 ) (1,770 ) (41 ) 285 Interest income 411 348 519 63 (171 ) Other expense (239 ) (111 ) (161 ) (128 ) 50 Other income 108 465 375 (357 ) 90 Gain on sale of investments 131 909 (131 ) (778 ) Loss on sale of subsidiary stock (31 ) 31 Goodwill impairment (21 ) (122 ) 101 (122 ) Asset impairment expense (1,221 ) (25 ) (175 ) (1,196 ) 150 Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position (33 ) 33 (184 ) (66 ) 217 Other non operating expense (7 ) (12 ) (15 ) 5 3 Income tax expense (307 ) (599 ) (771 ) 292 172 Net equity in earnings of affiliates 183 92 33 91 59 Income from continuing operations 920 1,809 1,929 (889 ) (120 ) Income from operations of discontinued businesses 75 96 97 (21 ) (1 ) Gain (loss) from disposal of discontinued businesses 64 (150 ) 6 214 (156 ) Net income 1,059 1,755 2,032 (696 ) (277 ) Noncontrolling interests: Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,006 ) (1,099 ) (759 ) 93 (340 ) (Income) loss from discontinuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (44 ) 2 (39 ) (46 ) 41 Net income attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 $ (649 ) $ (576 ) Per Share Data: Basic income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.75 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.69 ) Diluted income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.67 ) (1) Corporate and Other includes revenue from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, Wind Generation and other renewables initiatives.

These increases were partially offset by: lower volume sold at Uruguaiana of $53 million as a result of renegotiation of its power sales agreements; lower volume due to unfavorable hydrology in Colombia and Argentina of $41 million; lower contract prices at Gener of $32 million; and lower contract prices on PPAs indexed to international coal prices in the Dominican Republic of $22 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $106 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $34 million, or 3%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher spot prices in Argentina of $69 million; higher volume and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic of $55 million; higher contract prices of $33 million in Colombia; the positive impact of $28 million resulting from the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana, as mentioned above; and higher volume of $23 million in Panama. These increases were partially offset by: higher fuel and purchased energy prices at Gener of $48 million; the net effect of lower PPA prices and higher fuel costs in the Dominican Republic of $38 million; 130 Table of Contents the impact of a reversal of bad debt expense during the first quarter of 2009 of $36 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of one of its power sales agreements; and higher fixed costs of $30 million at Gener primarily due to higher employee costs, increased maintenance expenses and costs incurred due to construction delays at Campiche. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 17% while gross margin increased 10%, primarily due to higher spot purchases and fuel prices at Gener and the reversal of bad debt expense as a result of the renegotiation of one of the power sales agreements at Uruguaiana in the first quarter of 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $181 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $636 million, or 14%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower spot and contract prices of $295 million at Gener; lower volume of $227 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold; and lower energy prices and volume of $174 million in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: and increase of $100 million due to fewer outages at Gener and in Argentina in 2009; and higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $94 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $53 million, or 4%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;; fewer outages of $60 million at Gener and in Argentina; lower diesel consumption, partially offset by higher energy purchases and higher gas consumption, at Gener of $47 million; lower volume of energy purchased at Uruguaiana of $44 million as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements; and the favorable impact of $28 million of a decrease in bad debt expense at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of lower energy prices of $75 million in the Dominican Republic; lower volume and energy prices of $66 million in Argentina; higher purchased energy prices of $48 million at Uruguaiana; and lower spot sales of $48 million at Panama. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 18% while gross margin decreased 3%, primarily due to reduced energy purchases, fewer outages and lower bad debt expense. 131 Table of Contents Latin America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in Latin America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Latin America Utilities Revenue $ 7,222 $ 6,092 $ 5,907 19 % 3 % Gross Margin $ 1,072 $ 918 $ 886 17 % 4 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $697 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2010 increased $433 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $316 million, primarily in Brazil, due to increased market demand; and higher tariffs of $114 million primarily related to the July 2009 tariff reset in Brazil partially offset by the unfavorable impact on rates at Eletropaulo in Brazil of a cumulative adjustment to regulatory liabilities and higher energy prices across our Latin America utility businesses associated with energy purchases passed through to customers of $97 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $107 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $47 million, or 5%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $163 million, primarily in Brazil, due to the increased market demand; and lower contingencies of $142 million in Eletropaulo primarily related to labor contingencies which included a one time reversal, reflecting an agreement with Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o CESP, the pension plan administrator, of $51 million associated with claims for past benefit obligations which will now be accounted for as a component of the pension plan. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $238 million primarily due to the recovery in 2009 of a municipality receivable previously written off in Brazil and higher salaries and other employee related costs, provisions for commercial losses, regulatory penalties and maintenance costs; and $28 million related to the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $442 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2009 increased $627 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $560 million reflecting the recovery of energy purchases of $453 million that were passed through to customers at our utilities in Brazil and El Salvador; and higher volume in Brazil of $62 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $62 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2009 increased $94 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $107 million in El Salvador and Brazil; a $64 million recovery of a municipality receivable previously written off; 132 Table of Contents a non recurring PIS/COFINS fine in 2008 of $33 million; and higher volume of $32 million across the region. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of higher fixed costs of $120 million mainly related to pension expense, labor contingencies and maintenance costs in Brazil. North America Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Generation Revenue $ 1,972 $ 1,940 $ 2,234 2 % 13 % Gross Margin $ 435 $ 477 $ 660 9 % 28 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $19 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $13 million, or 1%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased rates, volume and an availability bonus at TEG/TEP in Mexico of $41 million; higher volume, primarily due to fewer outages and higher rates, of $22 million at Merida in Mexico; higher volume of $19 million at Warrior Run in Maryland due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. These increases were partially offset by: a net decrease of $50 million in New York due to lower rates partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a net decrease of $18 million at Deepwater in Texas primarily due to lower volume; and a net decrease of $14 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3 million, generation gross margin for 2010 decreased $45 million, or 9%, from 2009 primarily due to: a net decrease of $94 million in New York due to lower rates and higher coal prices partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a decrease of $16 million at Deepwater due to lower volume and rates; a net decrease of $11 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage; a decrease of $9 million in Hawaii due to an unfavorable impact of mark to market derivatives; and a decrease of $7 million in Puerto Rico due to higher fixed costs. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase of $39 million in New York primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of lower contract and maintenance costs, and other employee related costs; 133 Table of Contents a net increase of $26 million at TEG/TEP due to a current year availability bonus and fewer outages partially offset by higher fuel prices; higher volume of $14 million at Warrior Run due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 2% while gross margin decreased 9%, primarily due to the change in rates in New York having a greater impact on gross margin than revenue. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $44 million, primarily in Mexico, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $250 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $107 million in New York due to a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a decrease of $80 million due to a reduction in natural gas prices at Merida; increased outages of $22 million, $21 million and $17 million at Warrior Run, TEG/TEP and New York, respectively; lower rates of $20 million at Deepwater; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives in New York of $11 million; and the unfavorable impact in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $9 million, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $174 million, or 26%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $72 million in New York driven by a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a $29 million unfavorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments on coal supply contracts in Hawaii as a result of a gain of $22 million in 2008 compared to a loss of $7 million in 2009; an increase in outages of $22 million and $6 million at Warrior Run and in New York, respectively; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives of $11 million and higher emission allowance purchases of $13 million in New York; and the unfavorable impact of $9 million in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 13% while gross margin decreased 28%, primarily due to the increase in coal prices in New York and the unfavorable impact of derivatives in 2009 in Hawaii that had no corresponding impact on revenue. 134 Table of Contents North America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Utilities Revenue $ 1,145 $ 1,068 $ 1,079 7 % 1 % Gross Margin $ 249 $ 239 $ 261 4 % 8 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Utilities revenue for 2010 increased $77 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail demand of $64 million as a result of warmer weather and higher fuel adjustment charges; and increased wholesale revenue of $11 million primarily due to higher prices. Utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $10 million, or 4%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail margin of $20 million due to increased demand; lower pension expense of $12 million; and lower emission allowance expense of $5 million. These increases were partially offset by: increased maintenance expenses of $16 million due to the timing of major generating unit overhauls; and increased fixed costs of $14 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 7% while gross margin increased 4%, primarily due to increased fuel and maintenance costs. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Utilities revenue for 2009 decreased $11 million, or 1%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower retail volume of $31 million due primarily to milder weather and the economic recession; and decreased wholesale revenue of $7 million driven by lower market prices. These decreases were partially offset by: $32 million of voluntary credits IPL provided to retail customers in 2008. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters North America of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these credits. Utilities gross margin for 2009 decreased $22 million, or 8%, from 2008 primarily due to: decreased wholesale margin of $16 million due to unfavorable prices; and increased pension expense of $25 million largely due to the decline in market value of IPLs pension assets during 2008. 135 Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by: increased retail margin of $15 million, primarily due to the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, partially offset by lower retail sales volumes in 2009; and decreased property tax expense of $5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 1% while gross margin decreased 8%, primarily due to the $25 million increase in pension expense and the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, both of which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. Europe Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Europe for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Europe Generation Revenue $ 1,362 $ 820 $ 1,143 66 % 28 % Gross Margin $ 268 $ 212 $ 273 26 % 22 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $41 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $583 million, or 71%, from 2009 primarily due to: $409 million from the adoption of new accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) which resulted in the consolidation of Cartagena in Spain, a generation business previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting; $117 million from the operations of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom, which was acquired in August 2010; $16 million from a full year of combined cycle operations at our Amman East plant in Jordan, which was single cycle until August 2009; higher tariffs of $16 million at Altai in Kazakhstan; higher volume of $15 million at Kilroot in the United Kingdom largely driven by coal pass through and increased demand, partially offset by lower capacity revenue due to the termination of the long term PPA and related supplementary agreements. These increases were partially offset by: lower volume and sales of emissions allowances in Hungary of $16 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $1 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $57 million, or 27%, from 2009 primarily due to: $62 million from the consolidation of Cartagena as discussed above; higher tariffs and lower fixed costs at Altai of $29 million; and $13 million from the operations of Ballylumford since its acquisition. 136 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: lower gross margin of $28 million primarily from the termination of the long term PPA at Kilroot; and lower gross margin of $20 million in Hungary primarily attributable to higher fuel costs that could not be passed through and lower sales of emission allowances. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 66% while gross margin increased 26%, primarily due to the consolidation of Cartagena and acquisition of Ballylumford that have a larger positive impact on revenue than gross margin, and the positive impact of higher energy revenue at Kilroot, which as a pass through had no corresponding impact on gross margin. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $146 million, driven mainly by Kilroot, Hungary and Kazakhstan, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $177 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower revenue of $101 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower volume of $81 million in Hungary due to the combined impact of the cancellation of one of our PPAs and reduced demand; and lower volume of $67 million at Kilroot, a coal fired plant, mainly driven by lower dispatch due to favorable gas prices compared to coal. These decreases were partially offset by: the benefit of new business of $50 million at Amman East, which commenced single cycle operations in July 2008; and higher rates of $15 million in Kazakhstan. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $35 million, driven mainly by Kilroot and Kazakhstan, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $26 million, or 10%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower gross margin of $41 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower demand of $12 million in Hungary; and an overall increase of $22 million in fixed costs across the region. These decreases were partially offset by: higher capacity revenue at Kilroot; higher energy prices in Kazakhstan; and the benefit of new business at Amman East. Asia Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Asia for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Asia Generation Revenue $ 618 $ 375 $ 345 65 % 9 % Gross Margin $ 240 $ 93 $ (10 ) 158 % 1030 % 137 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $28 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $215 million, or 57%, from 2009 primarily due to: favorable generation rates and volume of $210 million at Masinloc in the Philippines as a result of increased market demand and improved plant availability subsequent to the completion of its overhaul at the beginning of 2010; and higher demand from both new and existing contract and spot customers as a result of lower supply shortages in the Philippines power market due to a strong energy growth rate. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $13 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $134 million, or 144%, from 2009 primarily due to a combination of higher availability attributable to improved plant operations, higher market demand and favorable spot prices at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 65% while gross margin increased 158%, primarily due to the positive influence on gross margin due to favorable spot rates and operational efficiencies resulting from the Masinloc plant overhauls in late 2009 and early 2010, which led to higher availability and allowed for more efficient operations that have materially improved the operating results for 2010 as compared to 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $23 million, primarily in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, generation revenue for 2009 increased $53 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: the benefit of $46 million of our new business Masinloc, which was acquired in April 2008; increased revenue of $70 million in 2009 at Masinloc due to improved rates and volume as a result of improved availability and new customer contracts; and $18 million from a one time favorable energy sales settlement at Masinloc. These increases were partially offset by: the decrease in revenue of $71 million at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka primarily due to a decline in fuel costs which are largely passed through to the customer and higher outages in 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by higher capacity revenue. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $6 million, primarily in the Philippines, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $109 million, or 1,090%, from 2008 primarily due to: the impact of our new business at Masinloc of $23 million; a $91 million increase at Masinloc due to higher contract sales, where margins are more favorable than spot sales, lower fuel prices, improved availability and the favorable energy sales settlement described above; and higher capacity revenue at Kelanitissa of $10 million. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $20 million at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue increased 9% while gross margin increased 1,030%, primarily due to higher contract margins at Masinloc as a result of improved operations, availability and lower fuel prices, as well as the larger relative impact on gross margin from the one time favorable energy sales settlement described above. 138 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Corporate and other includes the net operating results from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, AES Wind Generation and renewables projects which are immaterial for the purposes of separate segment disclosure. The following table excludes inter segment activity and summarizes revenue and gross margin for Corporate and Other entities for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Revenue Europe Utilities $ 356 $ 286 $ 403 24 % 29 % Africa Utilities 422 370 379 14 % 2 % Africa Generation 61 65 65 6 % 0 % Wind Generation 202 133 128 52 % 4 % Corp/Other 25 16 37 56 % 57 % Total Corporate and Other $ 1,066 $ 870 $ 1,012 23 % 14 % Gross Margin Europe Utilities $ 21 $ 16 $ 34 31 % 53 % Africa Utilities 65 71 30 8 % 137 % Africa Generation 54 41 28 32 % 46 % Wind Generation 44 11 19 300 % 42 % Corp/Other 2 (22 ) (49 ) 109 % 55 % Total Corporate and Other $ 186 $ 117 $ 62 59 % 89 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $30 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other revenue increased $226 million for 2010, or 26% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: higher volume at our utility businesses in Ukraine driven by an overall increase in market demand; higher volume and utility tariffs at Sonel in Cameroon driven by an increase in market demand; and incremental revenue from new wind generation projects that commenced operations during the year and an overall volume increase across our wind businesses. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $8 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $77 million for 2010, or 66% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: an increase in gross margin from our new wind generation projects and higher volume, as discussed above; and an increase in volume at Dibamba, our generation business, in Cameroon. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs at Sonel. 139 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $162 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other revenue increased $20 million for 2009, or 2%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: higher tariffs in Ukraine of $27 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $12 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $67 million for 2009, or 108%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: a decrease in fixed costs across the Africa region. The increase was partially offset by: higher fuel consumption attributable to lower hydrology at Sonel. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense includes those expenses related to corporate and region staff functions and or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems, and development costs. General and administrative expenses increased $53 million, or 16%, to $392 million in 2010 from 2009. The increase is primarily related to business development costs associated with increased development efforts, primarily in Europe, Turkey and India. General and administrative expenses decreased $29 million, or 8%, to $339 million in 2009 from 2008. The decrease is primarily related to 2008 professional fees associated with remediation efforts and a reduction in business development costs. The favorable variance is partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the worldwide implementation of SAP. Interest expense Interest expense increased $41 million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to interest expense at Cartagena which is now a consolidated entity, higher interest rates at Tiet&ecirc;, increased debt principal at Eletropaulo and interest being expensed related to St. Nikola, our wind project in Bulgaria, due to commencement of operations in 2010. These increases were partially offset by reduced debt principal at the Parent Company. Interest expense decreased $285 million, or 16%, to $1.5 billion in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates globally due to economic conditions and inflationary adjustments to the market price index in Brazil. In addition, interest expense decreased as a result of favorable foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil and lower interest expenses associated with decreased debt balances at Eletropaulo. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense at Masinloc in the Philippines which was acquired in April 2008, and interest expense at Infovias in Brazil where a fee on a non exercised credit line was written off. Interest income Interest income increased $63 million, or 18%, to $411 million in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to a higher average balance in short term investments at Eletropaulo and the favorable impact of 140 Table of Contents foreign currency translation in Brazil as well as the settlement of a dispute related to inflation adjustments for energy sales at Tiet&ecirc;. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest income from a loan to a wind development project in Brazil which was repaid in June 2010. Interest income decreased $171 million, or 33%, to $348 million in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances in Brazil, unfavorable foreign currency translation in Brazil, the impact of decreased interest rates and inflationary adjustments on accounts receivable in 2008 at Gener in Chile and a decreased cash balance at the Parent Company. Other income Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Gain on extinguishment of tax and other liabilities $ 65 $ 168 $ 199 Tax credit settlement 129 Performance incentive fee 80 Insurance proceeds 40 Gain on sale of assets 12 14 34 Other 31 74 102 Total other income $ 108 $ 465 $ 375 Other income of $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to the extinguishment of a swap liability owed by two of our Brazilian subsidiaries, resulting in the recognition of a $62 million gain. The net impact to the Company after taxes and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Other income also included a gain on sale of assets at Eletropaulo. Other income of $465 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $165 million from the reduction in interest and penalties associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the REFIS program and a $129 million gain related to a favorable court decision enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. The net impact to the Company after income taxes and noncontrolling interests for these items was $44 million. In addition, the Company recognized income in 2009 of $80 million from a performance incentive bonus for management services provided to Ekibastuz and Maikuben in 2008. The management agreement was related to the sale of these businesses in Kazakhstan in May 2008; see further discussion of this transaction in Note 22 Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Other income of $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included gains on the extinguishment of a gross receipts tax liability and a legal contingency at Eletropaulo of $117 million and $75 million, respectively, $32 million of cash proceeds related to a favorable legal settlement at Southland in California, $29 million of insurance recoveries for damaged turbines at Uruguaiana, $23 million of gains associated with a sale of land at Eletropaulo and sales of turbines at Itabo, and compensation of $18 million for the impairment associated with the settlement agreement to shut down Hefei. 141 Table of Contents Other expense Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Loss on sale and disposal of assets $ 84 $ 42 $ 34 Gener gas settlement 72 Loss on extinguishment of debt 37 70 AES Wind transaction costs 22 Other 24 69 57 Total other expense $ 239 $ 111 $ 161 Other expense of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $72 million for a settlement agreement of gas transportation contracts at Gener. There were also previously capitalized transaction costs of $22 million that were incurred in connection with the preparation for the sale of a noncontrolling interest in our Wind Generation business which were written off upon the expiration of the letter of intent in June 2010. In addition, there were losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo, Panama, and Gener, an $18 million loss on debt extinguishment at Andres and Itabo and a $15 million loss at the Parent Company from the retirement of senior notes. Other expense of $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $13 million loss recognized when three of our businesses in the Dominican Republic received $110 million par value bonds issued by the Dominican Republic government to settle existing accounts receivable for the same amount from the government owned distribution companies. The loss represented an adjustment to reflect the fair value of the bonds on the date received. Other expense also included losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo and Andres and contingencies at our businesses in Kazakhstan and Alicura in Argentina. Other expense of $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $69 million of losses on the retirement of debt at the Parent Company in connection with the refinancing in June 2008 and IPALCO associated with a $375 million refinancing in April 2008 and losses on disposal of assets primarily at Eletropaulo. Goodwill Impairment In 2010, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2010, Deepwater, our pet coke fired merchant generation facility in Texas, determined that there was an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. This determination was primarily based on managements decision not to operate the plant for more than 30 days in the third quarter of 2010, current operating and cash flow losses, and forecasted operating and cash flow losses for the remainder of 2010 through 2014 as a result of declining trends in energy pricing curves and increasing pet coke prices. As a result, Deepwater recognized a goodwill impairment of $18 million. Deepwater is reported in the North America Generation segment. In 2009, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $122 million. This was a result of impairment at certain of our businesses in the United Kingdom and Ukraine as a result of the Companys annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of October 1. The most significant goodwill impairment was at Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom. Factors contributing to the recognition of impairment included: reduced profit expectations based on latest estimates of future commodity prices and reduced expectations on the recovery of cash flows on the existing plant following the Companys decision to forgo capital expenditures to meet emission allowance requirements taking effect in 2024. The fair value of the Companys reporting units are inherently sensitive to the assumptions underlying the estimates of fair value. Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Fair Value, Goodwill and Intangibles in Item 8 of this Form 10 K provides a 142 Table of Contents more detailed discussion of those assumptions. As discussed in Key Trends and Uncertainties, in the future, the fair values of the Companys reporting units might decline as a result of adverse changes in their operating environments or the businesses reaching the end of their finite lives, which could require the Company to record additional goodwill impairment charges. The Company did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2008. Asset Impairment Expense As discussed in Note 19 Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, asset impairment expense for the year 2010 was $1,221 million and consisted primarily of the following: Eastern Energy AEE operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated a recoverability test of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Southland In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and the exact form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process 143 Table of Contents through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations and the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. The Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment. The asset group was determined to be at the individual plant level and based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined that the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the Huntington Beach asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying value of the Huntington Beach plant of $288 million exceeded the fair value of $88 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $200 million. The undiscounted cash flows of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach generation facilities exceeded their respective carrying values and resulted in no impairment. Huntington Beach is reported in the North America Generation reportable segment. Tisza II During the third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into annual negotiations with the offtaker of its Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. As a result of these preliminary negotiations, as well as the further deterioration of the economic environment in Hungary, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. Thus, the Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and determined that based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount of the Tisza II asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The carrying value of the Tisza II asset group of $160 million exceeded the fair value of $75 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $85 million. Tisza II is reported in the Europe Generation reportable segment. Deepwater In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW pet coke fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, 144 Table of Contents all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Asset impairment expense for the year 2009 was $25 million. In 2009, the Company recognized a pre tax long lived asset impairment charge of $11 million related to the Companys Piabanha hydro project in Brazil. The Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows and abandoned the project. Asset impairment expense for the year 2008 was $175 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, the Company reviewed and prioritized projects in the development pipeline. From this review, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows for certain projects. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $75 million ($34 million, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes) related to two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non power development project at one of our facilities in North America. During 2008, the Company recognized additional impairment charges of $36 million related to long lived assets at Uruguaiana. The impairment was triggered by a combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy in 2007 that continued in 2008. Following an initial impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, further charges were incurred in 2008 due to fixed asset purchase agreements in place. During the first half of 2008, the Company withdrew from projects in South Africa and Israel which resulted in impairment charges of $36 million. The Company also recognized an impairment of $18 million related to the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China. Gain on sale of investments There was no gain on sale of investments in 2010. Gain on sale of investments of $131 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $98 million recognized in May 2009 related to the termination of the management agreement between the Company and Kazakhmys PLC for Ekibastuz and Maikuben, a gain of $14 million from the sale of the remaining assets associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China and $13 million from the reversal of a contingent liability related to the Kazakhstan sale in 2008. Gain on sale of investments of $909 million in 2008 consisted primarily of the sale in May 2008 of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Ekibastuz and Maikuben for a net gain of $905 million. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock There was no loss on sale of subsidiary stock in 2010 or 2009. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock of $31 million in 2008 was the result of sales of AES Gener shares made by our wholly owned subsidiary Cachagua. In November 2008, Cachagua sold 9.6% of its ownership in Gener to a third party reducing its ownership in Gener to 70.6%. 145 Table of Contents Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Companys net monetary position from foreign currency transaction activities: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) AES Corporation $ (50 ) $ 13 $ 38 Chile 8 65 (96 ) Philippines 8 15 (57 ) Brazil (6 ) (9 ) (44 ) Argentina 12 (10 ) (28 ) Kazakhstan 1 (24 ) 14 Colombia (4 ) (11 ) 5 Other (2 ) (6 ) (16 ) Total(1) $ (33 ) $ 33 $ (184 ) (1) Includes (losses) gains of $(10) million, $(39) million and $10 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These losses consisted primarily of losses at The AES Corporation partially offset by gains in Argentina. Losses of $50 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the devaluation of notes receivable resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound, and losses on foreign exchange swaps and options, partially offset by gains on cash balances and debt denominated in British Pounds. Gains of $12 million in Argentina were primarily due to a gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso by 5%, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These gains consisted primarily of gains in Chile, the Philippines and at The AES Corporation partially offset by losses in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. Gains of $65 million in Chile were primarily due to the appreciation of the Chilean Peso of 20% resulting in gains at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Peso, mainly cash and accounts receivables. This gain was partially offset by $14 million in losses on foreign currency derivatives. Gains of $15 million in the Philippines were primarily due to the appreciation of the Philippine Peso of 3%, resulting in gains at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on the remeasurement of U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $13 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the settlement of the senior unsecured credit facility and the revaluation of notes receivable denominated in the Euro, partially offset by losses on debt denominated in British Pounds. Losses of $24 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar and $12 million of foreign currency transaction losses on debt and other liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Kazakh Tenge. 146 Table of Contents Losses of $11 million in Colombia were primarily due to the appreciation of the Colombian Peso of 9%, resulting in losses at Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its Colombian Peso denominated debt and losses on foreign currency derivatives. Losses of $10 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2009, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt, partially offset by derivative gains. Losses of $9 million in Brazil were primarily due to energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar, resulting in foreign currency transaction losses of $18 million, partially offset by gains of $9 million due to the appreciation in 2009 of the Brazilian Real of 25%, resulting in gains at Sul and Uruguaiana associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These losses consisted primarily of losses in Chile, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina partially offset by gains at The AES Corporation and in Kazakhstan. Losses of $96 million in Chile were primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso of 28% in 2008, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable and value added tax (VAT) receivables. Losses of $57 million in the Philippines were primarily due to remeasurement losses at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on U.S. Dollar denominated debt resulting from depreciation of the Philippine Peso of 14% in 2008. Losses of $44 million in Brazil were primarily due to the realization of deferred exchange variance on past energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar. Losses of $28 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2008, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $38 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to debt denominated in British Pounds and gains on foreign exchange derivatives, partially offset by losses on notes receivable denominated in the Euro. Gains of $14 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction gains of $16 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar, offset by $5 million of foreign currency transaction losses on external and intercompany debt denominated in other than the Kazakh Tenge functional currency. Income taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $292 million, or 49%, to $307 million in 2010. The Companys effective tax rates were 29% for 2010 and 26% for 2009. The net increase in the 2010 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 relating to the CEMIG sale transaction, tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowances at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, and $165 million of non taxable income recorded in 2009 at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program. These items were offset by income tax benefits related to a reversal of withholding tax liabilities at certain Chilean subsidiaries and 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries. Included in the net tax expense related to the CEMIG sale transaction is tax expense on the equity earnings associated with the reversal of the net long term liability and tax benefit related to release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. 147 Table of Contents Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $172 million, or 22%, to $599 million in 2009. The Companys effective tax rates were 26% for 2009 and 29% for 2008. The net decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowance at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recorded at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $91 million, or 99%, to $183 million in 2010 from $92 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a gain recognized upon the sale of our interest in CEMIG during the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by 2009 equity in earnings of Cartagena which was accounted for as a consolidated entity in 2010 and thus reported directly within revenues and expenses. Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $59 million, or 179%, to $92 million in 2009 from $33 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a cash settlement received by Cartagena, in Spain, in June 2009 for liquidated damages received related to a construction delay from December 2005 to November 2006; increased earnings at Guacolda in Chile mainly due to lower cost of coal; increased earnings of Chigen affiliates from higher tariffs partially offset by lower volume and a valuation write off in 2008 at an affiliate in Turkey. These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings at OPGC, in India, mainly due to lower tariff and a dividend distribution tax in March 2009 and increased expenses for an equipment overhaul at Elsta in the Netherlands. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $93 million, or 8%, to $1.0 billion in 2010 from $1.1 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreased earnings at Eletropaulo as a result of the absence of legal settlement income present in 2009, a loss on legal settlement at Gener and reduced revenues due to decreased coal prices along with higher electricity purchases at Itabo. These decreases were partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian Real. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $340 million, or 45%, to $1.1 billion in 2009 from $0.8 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to increases in gross margin and other income, lower interest expense and a decrease in impairments in 2009 at our Brazilian businesses, and increases in gross margin and foreign currency transaction gains at our businesses in Chile. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $44 million at certain of our wind generation businesses as a result of a charge related to the potential future taxes that could be deemed due in the calculation of the hypothetical liquidation value of certain of our wind tax equity partnerships. Discontinued operations As further discussed in Note 21 Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Businesses to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, Discontinued Operations includes the results of five businesses: Ras Laffan, a generation business in Qatar (sold in October 2010); Barka, a generation business in Oman, (sold in August 2010); Lal Pir and Pak Gen, generation businesses in Pakistan, (sold in June 2010); and Jiaozuo, a generation business in China, (sold in December 2008). Prior periods have been restated to reflect these businesses within Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. In 2010, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $39 million and reflected the operations of our 55% stake in Ras Laffan, a combined cycle gas facility and water desalination plant in Qatar, our 35% stake in Barka, a combined cycle gas 148 Table of Contents facility and water desalination plant in Oman and our 55% stake in Lal Pir and Pak Gen, two oil fired facilities in Pakistan. The sale of Lal Pir and Pak Gen closed in June 2010, resulting in additional impairment expense and a loss on the sale in 2010 of $14 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The Barka plant was sold in August 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $63 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The sale of Ras Laffan closed in October 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $6 million, net of tax. In 2009, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $54 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir and Pak Gen. Loss on disposal of discontinued businesses, net of tax and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $105 million and represented the difference between the net book value of the Companys interests in its Pakistan businesses and their estimated fair value. In 2008, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $60 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir, Pak Gen and Jiaozuo, a coal fired generation facility in China sold in December 2008. The Company received $73 million for its 70% interest in the business. The net gain on the disposition was $7 million. Critical Accounting Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Companys most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Reserves We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the tax jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material. 149 Table of Contents On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act). The Act includes several provisions which provide for tax relief for businesses by extending certain tax benefits and credits, including the Subpart F exception for active financing income and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look through provisions of Subpart F. This legislation resulted in a benefit for the Companys 2010 provision for income taxes; however, there can be no assurances that the benefits of this legislation will extend beyond 2011, when it is currently scheduled to expire. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Goodwill and Other Intangibles and Long lived Assets, respectively, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level on October 1. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying amount. A long lived asset (asset group) will be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e., the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are less than its carrying amount. In the event that the carrying amount of the long lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment evaluation is performed, in which the fair value of the asset is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. Examples of indicators that would result in an impairment test for goodwill and a recoverability test for long lived assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate, legislation changes or a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition. Throughout the impairment evaluation process, management makes considerable judgments; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part of an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost/benefit analysis and the Companys internal valuation knowledge of the long lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the DCF model), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factors expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. 150 Table of Contents A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Managements Discussion and Analysis, Consolidated Results of Operations Goodwill Impairment and Asset Impairment Expense and Note 19 Impairment Expense and Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Fair Value Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent), derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long term liabilities. The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Companys investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Companys derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where 151 Table of Contents derivatives qualify and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Companys interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Companys derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterpartys) and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Platts). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instruments fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on indicative pricing quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities The Company adopted the fair value measurement accounting guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009. The most significant of these estimates surround the fair value measurement of long lived tangible and intangible assets when tested for impairment upon a triggering event or during the annual impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill. These estimates include making assumptions regarding useful life, the impact of economic obsolescence and expected future cash flows. Additional factors are discussed above in the Impairments section. 152 Table of Contents Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard creates a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Risks Associated with our Operations We do a significant amount of business outside the United States, including in developing countries, which presents significant risks. A significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the United States and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. Part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in developing countries because the growth rates and the opportunity to implement operating improvements and achieve higher operating margins may be greater than those typically achievable in more developed countries. International operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region; adverse changes in currency exchange rates; government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds; unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies; high inflation and monetary fluctuations; restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate; threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments; difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with GAAP expertise; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts; unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties; inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems; adverse changes in government tax policy; 82 Table of Contents difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions. Any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, partly in response to challenging business and political conditions in Kazakhstan, in 2008, we sold certain businesses in that country. As another example, in the second quarter of 2007, we sold our stake in EDC to Petr&oacute;leos de Venezuela, S.A., the state owned energy company in Venezuela after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened to expropriate the electricity business in Venezuela. In connection with the sale, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $680 million. In addition, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenues and gross margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. The operation of power generation and distribution facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results. We and or our subsidiaries may not have adequate insurance coverage for liabilities. We are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including: changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, explosions, terrorist acts or other similar occurrences; and changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to: gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance. Our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations, or interruptions in transportation including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. This could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurring a liability for liquidated damages and or other penalties. As a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation and distribution industries, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to 83 Table of Contents transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or certain external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks. The hazards described above can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A claim for which we are not fully insured or insured at all could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our businesses insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with its operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results or operations, financial condition and prospects. Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our inability to attract and retain skilled people could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. In particular, we routinely are required to assess the financial and tax impacts of complicated business transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. These assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise in GAAP to timely and accurately comply with United States reporting obligations. An inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse affect on our financial and tax reporting. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for load requirements and may result in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. The uncertainty regarding the amount of power that our power generation and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our operating costs. A significant under or over estimation of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much power to cover their obligations, in which case we would be required to buy or sell power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. Those prices may not be favorable and thus could increase our operating costs. 84 Table of Contents We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. Even when we successfully enter into long term contracts, our generation businesses are often dependent on one or a limited number of customers and a limited number of fuel suppliers. Many of our generation plants conduct business under long term contracts. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plants output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts range from 1 to 25 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable. For example, during the past several years, various governmental authorities in Europe have terminated or declined to fulfill their obligations under long term contracts with our subsidiaries. In 2008, as part of the accession to the European Union, the Hungarian government terminated all long term PPAs, including AES Tiszas PPA, as of December 31, 2008. Partly as a result of the termination AES Tiszas results of operations declined and we were required to record an $85 million asset impairment charge for AES Tisza in the third quarter of 2010. Kilroot in Northern Ireland received notice from the Utility Regulator directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the Generating Unit Agreements for the two coal fired units effective November 1, 2010 and, as a result, the performance (and contributions to income and cash flow) from Kilroot will decline in 2011 when compared to prior years. Furthermore, these businesses (and any other businesses whose long term contracts may be challenged) may have to sell electricity into the spot markets. Because of the volatile nature of inputs and power prices, the inability to secure long term contracts could generate increased volatility in our earnings and cash flows and could generate substantial losses (or result in a write down of assets), which could have a material impact on our business and results of operations. We have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customers obligations. However, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment grade credit rating, and our Generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful. These risks have increased as a result of the deteriorating and volatile global economy. For further discussion of these global economic conditions and their potential impact on the Company, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions in this Form 10 K. Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us. The power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain 85 Table of Contents markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas fired power plants have also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on us. Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions. Certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Of the twenty nine defined benefit plans, three are at United States subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. The Company periodically evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. The Companys exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans are more heavily weighted to investments in fixed income securities that have not been as severely impacted by the global recession. Future downturns in the debt and or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. Our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. This may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the Parent Company and our subsidiaries liquidity. For additional information regarding the funding position of the Companys pension plans, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates Pension and Postretirement Obligations and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K. Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties. Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing greenfield power plants, some but not all of which have signed long term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to failures of siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. Timing of equipment purchases can also pose financial risks to the Company. As part of our development process, we attempt to make purchases of equipment and or materials as needed. However, from time to time, there may be excess demand for certain types of equipment with substantial delays between the time we place orders and receive delivery. In those instances, to avoid construction delays and costs associated with the inability to own and place such equipment and or materials into service when needed in the construction process, we may place orders well in advance of deployment. In some cases, we may order such equipment and or materials without yet having a specific project where the equipment and or materials will be deployed, in anticipation that equipment and materials will be needed at the time of delivery. However, there is a risk that at the time of delivery, we are required to accept delivery and pay for such equipment and or materials, even though no project has materialized where these items will be used. This can result in our having to incur material equipment and or material costs, with no deployment plan at delivery. Financing risk has also increased as a result of the deterioration of the global economy and the crisis in the financial markets and, as a result, we may forgo certain development opportunities. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are 86 Table of Contents recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, management believes that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this timeframe. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. Historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses may be government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that: we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership; such businesses will perform as expected; integration or other one time costs will not be greater than expected; we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities; such business will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest our capital to acquire them. 87 Table of Contents In some of our joint venture projects and businesses, we have granted protective rights to minority holders or we own less than a majority of the equity in the project or business and do not manage or otherwise control the project or business, which entails certain risks. We have invested in some joint ventures where we own less than a majority of the voting equity in the venture. Very often, one of our subsidiaries seeks to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of projects or businesses in which we have less than a majority of the ownership interests by operating the project or business pursuant to a management contract, negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we do not always have this type of control over the project or business in every instance; and we may be dependent on our co venturers to operate such projects or businesses. Our co venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally. The approval of co venturers also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. In some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders. For example, Companhia Brasiliana de Energia (Brasiliana) is a holding company in which we have a controlling equity interest and through which we own three of our four Brazilian businesses: Eletropaulo, Tiet&ecirc; and Uruguaiana. We entered into a shareholders agreement with an affiliate of the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) which owns more than 49% of the voting equity of Brasiliana. Among other things, the shareholders agreement requires the consent of both parties before taking certain corporate actions, grants both parties rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of interests in Brasiliana and grants certain drag along rights to BNDES. In May 2007, BNDES notified us that it intends to sell all of its interest in Brasiliana pursuant to a public auction (the Brasiliana Sale). BNDES also informed us that if we fail to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of its interest in Brasiliana, then BNDES intends to exercise its drag along rights under the shareholders agreement and cause us to sell all of our interests in Brasiliana in the Brasiliana Sale as well. BNDES has since suspended the auction; however, BNDES may determine to recommence a sale process in the future. In that event, after the auction, if a third party offer has been received in the Brasiliana Sale, we will have 30 days to exercise our right of first refusal to purchase all of BNDESs interest in Brasiliana on the same terms as the third party offer. If we do not exercise this right and BNDES proceeds to exercise its drag along rights, then we may be forced to sell all of our interest in Brasiliana. Due to the uncertainty in the sale price at this point in time, we are uncertain whether we will exercise our right of first refusal should BNDES receive a valid third party offer in the Brasiliana Sale and, if we do, whether we would do it alone or with joint venture partners. Even if we desire to exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot assure that we will have the cash on hand or that debt or equity financing will be available at acceptable terms in order to purchase BNDESs interest in Brasiliana. If we do not exercise our right of first refusal, we cannot be assured that we will not have to record a loss if the sale price is below the book value of our investment in Brasiliana. Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and regulatory challenges. AES Wind Generation, AES Solar, our greenhouse gas emissions reductions projects (GHG Emissions Reduction Projects), and our investments in projects such as energy storage are subject to substantial risks. Projects of this nature have been developed through advancement in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and which are unrelated to our core business. Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future. For example, several European countries have recently faced a debt crisis, which has or may result in government austerity measures. If these incentives are repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, this could materially impact our renewable businesses, results of operations and financial condition, and impact the ability of the affected 88 Table of Contents businesses to continue or grow their operations. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries, which could also have a material impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, production levels for our wind, solar, and GHG Emissions Reduction Projects may be dependent upon adequate wind, sunlight, or biogas production which can vary significantly from period to period, resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. For example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year. With regard to GHG Emissions Reduction Projects, there is particular uncertainty about whether agreements providing incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, such as the Kyoto Protocol, will continue and whether countries around the world will enact or maintain legislation that provides incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, without which such projects may not be economical or financing for such projects may become unavailable. As a result, renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. In addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in Generation and Utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that many of these projects exist in new or emerging markets, where long term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. These projects can be capital intensive and generally require that we obtain third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects. These risks may be exacerbated by the current global economic crisis, including our managements increased focus on liquidity, which may also result in slower growth in the number of projects we can pursue. The economic downturn could also impact the value of our assets in these countries and our ability to develop these projects. If the value of these assets decline, this could result in a material impairment or a series of impairments which are material in the aggregate, which would adversely affect our financial statements. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or long lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. The fair value of a reporting unit has been determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill outside of the required annual assessment process if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. There could also be impairments if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. See further discussion in Risk Factor, Our Acquisitions May Not Perform as Expected. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. As of December 31, 2010, we had $1.3 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3% of total assets. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to 89 Table of Contents impair goodwill, as further described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Long lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives. Long lived assets are evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of long lived assets, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates, commodity prices and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. Generally, the fair value of a long lived asset or asset group is determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each asset group. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or adverse action or assessment by a regulator. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in additional long lived asset impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to impair long lived assets, as further described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather. Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In the past, our businesses in Latin America have been negatively impacted by lower than normal rainfall. Similarly, our wind businesses are dependent on adequate wind conditions while the solar projects at AES Solar are dependent on sufficient sunlight. In each case, inadequate wind or sunlight could have a material adverse impact on these businesses. Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes. Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our Utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to: changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations; 90 Table of Contents changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utilitys operating income or the rates it charges customers is too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates; changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non controllable costs; adverse changes in tax law; changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium; changes in the timing of tariff increases; other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business. Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business. In many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing or the regulations can be difficult to interpret. As a result, there is risk that we may not properly interpret certain regulations and may not understand the impact of certain regulations on our business. For example, in October 2006, ANEEL, which regulates our utility operations at Sul and Eletropaulo in Brazil, issued Normative Resolution 234 requiring that utilities begin amortizing a liability called Special Obligations beginning with their second tariff reset cycle in 2007 or a later year as an offset to depreciation expense. As of May 23, 2007, the date of the filing of our 2006 Form 10 K, no industry positions or any other consensus had been reached regarding how ANEEL guidance should be applied at that date and accordingly, no adjustments to the financial statements were made relating to Special Obligations in Brazil. Subsequent to May 23, 2007, industry discussions occurred and other Brazilian companies filed Forms 20 F with the SEC reflecting the impact of Resolution 234 in their December 31, 2006 financial statements differently from how the Company accounted for Resolution 234. In the absence of any significant regulatory developments between May 23, 2007 and the date of these other filings, the Company determined that Resolution 234 required us to record an adjustment to our Special Obligations liability as of December 31, 2006. In part, the decision to record the adjustment led to the restatement of our financial statements in the third quarter of 2007. If we face additional challenges interpreting regulations or changes in regulations, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act). While the bulk of regulations contained in the Dodd Frank Act regulate financial institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive compensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to public companies generally. The types of provisions described above are currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Furthermore, while the Dodd Frank Act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, the Dodd Frank Act provides for commercial end user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions, though this is not certain since the Act directs the SEC, CFTC and listed companies to enact rules that will clarify the Dodd Frank Act, and such rulemaking could impact the availability of the commercial end user exemption. Even if the exemption is available, the Dodd Frank Act could still have a material adverse impact on the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non exempt companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these risks. Even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, which could adversely affect the operating results of certain projects; cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated to hedge certain risks, such as project financing agreements; prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; cause the Company to abandon certain of its hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; and or consume substantial liquidity by forcing the Company to post cash and or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 91 Table of Contents On June 12, 2009 AES Kelanitissa received a letter and an invoice from the Director General, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUC) seeking payment of an Annual Regulatory Fee and pursuant to PUC assurances on an application for renewal of the AES Kelanitissa generation license. The application is pursuant to an April 2009 revision of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act (Electricity Act), which came into force in April 2009, notwithstanding that in March 29, 2001, AES Kelanitissa had been granted, and pre paid fees for, a 21 year generation license with effect from September 25, 2000 under the Electricity Act, 1950. AES Kelanitissa submitted an application to be licensed under the revised legislation and, on August 26, 2009, PUC published its intention to issue a generation license under the revised legislation to AES Kelanitissa and other Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in Sri Lanka. This was consistent with assurances received from relevant authorities that the revised legislation was to be amended to grandfather IPPs with existing generation licenses. In a letter dated June 21, 2010 from the PUC, AES Kelanitissa was informed that under the new regulations, as amended in 2009, AES Kelanitissa (Pvt) Ltd no longer fulfilled the eligibility criteria to apply for a generation license. The eligibility criteria to which the letter refers is a provision requiring an element of state ownership. Representatives of AES Kelanitissa have been informed that an amendment to the Electricity Act to grandfather existing IPPs remains in the legislative pipeline, although it is not possible to predict with certainty when or whether such an amendment will be passed. In addition, AES Kelanitissa believes that under Sri Lankan law, it may continue operations under the 21 year license issued in 2001. No step has been taken to date to prohibit AES Kelanitissa from generating power and conducting its operations. However, in the event that it is determined that AES Kelanitissa may not operate under its current license or the revised legislation is not amended (and PUC maintains that AES Kelanitissa is ineligible for a generation license or extension of the Generating License), AES Kelanitissa may not be able to continue operations on grounds that it has no license under the revised legislation. In that event, AES Kelanitissa and or the Company could face a number of adverse consequences, including potential litigation with counterparties mitigating a write down in the value of the assets of the business, continued default status under its debt documents and or other consequences which could have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Our Generation business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the FERC, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations. EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the obligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of the Midwest Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) Interconnection, L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is authorized under the new law to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case by case basis. While the new law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to PURPA, our QFs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long term contracts expire. EPAct 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the United States generation market. 92 Table of Contents In accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets. While the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost of service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate. Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our activities are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air and water emissions. See the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters of this Form 10 K. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies. The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal fired generating plants alleging wide spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with approximately 17 companies over such allegations. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. The principal focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO2 and NOX. In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOX. One of our businesses, IPL, is currently the subject of such an EPA enforcement action, and another business, Eastern Energy, has received an information request from the EPA in connection with a possible enforcement action. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10 K for more detail with respect to these EPA enforcement actions and information requests. There can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations. 93 Table of Contents Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As discussed in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations, at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect or policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2010, the Companys subsidiaries operated businesses which had total approximate CO2 emissions of 77.2 million metric tonnes approximately 40 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 18 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based upon a number of projections and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect such as the forecast dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO2 emissions and our subsidiaries achieving completion of such construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with emissions described below. Because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates. The subsidiaries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there can be no assurance that the subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the Company. Foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial performance. The actual impact on the Companys financial performance and the financial performance of the Companys subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the cost of emissions reduction equipment the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material impact on our results of operations. In January 2005, based on European Community Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading, the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) commenced operation as the largest multi country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the 40 developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO2. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In the United States, there currently is no legislation establishing federal mandatory GHG emission reduction programs (including CO2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. However, federal GHG legislation has been proposed in the United States Congress that would, if enacted, constrain GHG emissions, including CO2, and or impose costs on 94 Table of Contents us that could be material to our business or results of operations. The EPA has also initiated regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new sources of GHG emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing sources planning physical changes that would increase their GHG emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. Such regulations could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse effect on our business and or results of operations. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regulations. At the state level, RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast, became effective in January 2009, and the WCI is also developing market based programs to address GHG emissions in seven western states. In addition, several states, including California, have adopted comprehensive legislation that, when effective, will require mandatory GHG reductions from several industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about the United States state environmental regulations we face. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below), the Company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with United States federal, regional or state CO2 emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that these proposals are in earlier stages of development and any final regulations or legislation, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. The RGGI program became effective in January 2009. The first regional auction of RGGI allowances needed to be acquired by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI was held in September 2008, with subsequent auctions occurring approximately every quarter. Our subsidiaries in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland are subject to RGGI. Of the approximately 40 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2010 (ownership adjusted), approximately 11.3 million metric tonnes were emitted in United States states participating in RGGI. Over the past three years, such emissions have averaged approximately 10.9 million metric tonnes. While CO2 emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of CO2 compliance based on a 3 year average of CO2 emissions for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes a price of $1.86 per allowance under RGGI. The source of this allowance price estimate was the clearing price in the recent RGGI allowance auction held in December 2010. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $15 million for 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance. In addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. For example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. In addition, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. In addition, environmental groups and other private plaintiffs have brought and may decide to bring additional private lawsuits against the Company because of its subsidiaries GHG emissions. The Company is facing and may face in the future private lawsuits relating to GHG emissions that may have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. In one recent case in the United States, which does not involve the Company, a federal appellate court reversed the dismissal by a federal district court of nuisance and other claims against emitters of GHG based on property damage allegedly caused by their contributions to global warming. While the scope of relief sought in that case is 95 Table of Contents unclear, the plaintiffs in this case evidently seek injunctive relief to prevent or reduce further GHG emissions. The defendants appealed the appellate court decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court is expected to render a decision in 2011. If the defendants do not prevail, other parties may be encouraged to bring similar suits against electric power generators, including the Company or any of its United States subsidiaries. Also, unless the United States Congress acts to preempt such suits as part of comprehensive federal legislation, additional lawsuits may be brought against the Company or its subsidiaries. At this stage of the litigation, it is impossible to predict whether such lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the Companys business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Companys subsidiaries. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel fired electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation. In addition to potential physical risks noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of the Company and its subsidiaries due to public perception of GHG emissions by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHG emissions made by subsidiaries of the Company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the Company. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the Companys subsidiaries and on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our subsidiaries have operations in the United States and various non United States jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many non United States jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as non United States, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities. We and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. We and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. 96 Table of Contents The SEC is conducting an informal inquiry relating to our restatements. We have been cooperating with an informal inquiry by the SEC Staff concerning our past restatements and related matters, and have been providing information and documents to the SEC Staff on a voluntary basis. Although we have not received correspondence regarding this inquiry for some time, we have not been advised that the matter is closed. Because we are unable to predict the outcome of this inquiry, the SEC Staff may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported the financial impact of the adjustments to previously filed financial statements and there may be a risk that the inquiry by the SEC could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate previously filed financial statements, amend prior filings or take other actions not currently contemplated. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We maintain offices in many places around the world, generally pursuant to the provisions of long and short term leases, none of which we believe are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are described in Item 1 of this Form 10 K, are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the projects related finance facility. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased. However, in a few instances, no accompanying project financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business, some of which are described below. The Company has accrued for litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has evaluated claims in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies that it deems both probable and reasonably estimable and accordingly, has recorded aggregate reserves for all claims for approximately $450 million and $482 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. These are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within accrued and other liabilities and other long term liabilities. A significant portion of these reserves relate to employment, non income tax and customer disputes in international jurisdictions, principally Brazil. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries, principally in Brazil, are defendants in a number of labor and employment lawsuits. The complaints generally seek unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or other relief. The subsidiaries have denied any liability and intend to vigorously defend themselves in all of these proceedings. There can be no assurance that this reserve will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise. The Company believes, based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. However, even where no reserve has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company, and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material. In 1989, Centrais El&eacute;tricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobr&aacute;s) filed suit in the Fifth District Court in the State of Rio de Janeiro against Eletropaulo Eletricidade de S&atilde;o Paulo S.A. (EEDSP) relating to the methodology for calculating monetary adjustments under the parties financing agreement. In April 1999, the Fifth District Court 97 Table of Contents found for Eletrobr&aacute;s and in September 2001, Eletrobr&aacute;s initiated an execution suit in the Fifth District Court to collect approximately R$1.10 billion ($659 million) from Eletropaulo (as estimated by Eletropaulo) and a lesser amount from an unrelated company, Companhia de Transmiss&atilde;o de Energia El&eacute;trica Paulista (CTEEP) (Eletropaulo and CTEEP were spun off from EEDSP pursuant to its privatization in 1998). In November 2002, the Fifth District Court rejected Eletropaulos defenses in the execution suit. Eletropaulo appealed and in September 2003, the Appellate Court of the State of Rio de Janeiro (AC) ruled that Eletropaulo was not a proper party to the litigation because any alleged liability had been transferred to CTEEP pursuant to the privatization. In June 2006, the Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) reversed the Appellate Courts decision and remanded the case to the Fifth District Court for further proceedings, holding that Eletropaulos liability, if any, should be determined by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulos subsequent appeals to the Special Court (the highest court within the SCJ) and the Supreme Court of Brazil were dismissed. Eletrobr&aacute;s later requested that the amount of Eletropaulos alleged debt be determined by an accounting expert appointed by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulo consented to the appointment of such an expert, subject to a reservation of rights. In February 2010, the Fifth District Court appointed an accounting expert to determine the amount of the alleged debt and the responsibility for its payment in light of the privatization, in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletrobr&aacute;s. Pursuant to its reservation of rights, Eletropaulo filed an interlocutory appeal with the AC asserting that the expert was required to determine the issues in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletropaulo, and that Eletropaulo should be entitled to take discovery and present arguments on the issues to be determined by the expert. In April 2010, the AC issued a decision agreeing with Eletropaulos arguments and directing the Fifth District Court to proceed accordingly. Eletrobr&aacute;s may restart the accounting proceedings at the Fifth District Court at any time, which would proceed according to the ACs April 2010 decision. In the Fifth District Court proceedings, the experts conclusions will be subject to the Fifth District Courts review and approval. If Eletropaulo is determined to be responsible for the debt, after the amount of the alleged debt is determined, Eletrobr&aacute;s will be entitled to resume the execution suit in the Fifth District Court at any time. If Eletrobr&aacute;s does so, Eletropaulo will be required to provide security in the amount of its alleged liability. In that case, if Eletrobr&aacute;s requests the seizure of such security and the Fifth District Court grants such request, Eletropaulos results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and in turn the Companys results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, in February 2008, CTEEP filed a lawsuit in the Fifth District Court against Eletrobr&aacute;s and Eletropaulo seeking a declaration that CTEEP is not liable for any debt under the financing agreement. The parties are disputing the proper venue for the CTEEP lawsuit. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In August 2000, the FERC announced an investigation into the organized California wholesale power markets to determine whether rates were just and reasonable. Further investigations involved alleged market manipulation. FERC requested documents from each of the AES Southland, LLC plants and AES Placerita, Inc. AES Southland and AES Placerita have cooperated fully with the FERC investigations. AES Southland was not subject to refund liability because it did not sell into the organized spot markets due to the nature of its tolling agreement. After hearings at FERC, AES Placerita was found subject to refund liability of $588,000 plus interest for spot sales to the California Power Exchange from October 2, 2000 to June 20, 2001. As FERC investigations and hearings progressed, numerous appeals on related issues were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Over the years, the Ninth Circuit issued several opinions that had the potential to expand the scope of the FERC proceedings and increase refund exposure for AES Placerita and other sellers of electricity. Following remand of one of the Ninth Circuit appeals in March 2009, FERC started a new hearing process involving AES Placerita and other sellers. In May 2009, AES Placerita entered into a settlement, approved by FERC in July 2009, concerning the claims before FERC against AES Placerita relating to the California energy crisis of 2000 2001, including the California refund proceeding. Pursuant to the settlement, AES Placerita paid $6 million and assigned a receivable of $168,119 due to it from the California Power Exchange in return for a release of all claims against it at FERC by the settling parties and other consideration. More than 98% of the buyers in the market elected to join the settlement. A small amount of AES Placeritas settlement payment was placed in escrow for buyers that did not join the settlement (non settling parties). It is unclear whether the escrowed funds will be enough to satisfy any additional sums that might be determined to be owed to 98 Table of Contents non settling parties at the conclusion of the FERC proceedings concerning the California energy crisis. However, any such additional sums are expected to be immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2009, one non settling party, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), filed an appeal of the FERCs approval of the settlement which is pending in the Ninth Circuit. SMUDs appeal has been stayed pending further order of the court. The settlement agreement is still effective and will continue to remain effective unless it is vacated by the Ninth Circuit. SMUD has reached a settlement in principal with buyers of electricity that, if approved by FERC, will leave only immaterial claims of non settling parties against AES Placerita. In August 2001, the Grid Corporation of Orissa, India, now Gridco Ltd. (Gridco), filed a petition against the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (CESCO), an affiliate of the Company, with the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC), alleging that CESCO had defaulted on its obligations as an OERC licensed distribution company, that CESCO management abandoned the management of CESCO, and asking for interim measures of protection, including the appointment of an administrator to manage CESCO. Gridco, a state owned entity, is the sole wholesale energy provider to CESCO. Pursuant to the OERCs August 2001 order, the management of CESCO was replaced with a government administrator who was appointed by the OERC. The OERC later held that the Company and other CESCO shareholders were not necessary or proper parties to the OERC proceeding. In August 2004, the OERC issued a notice to CESCO, the Company and others giving the recipients of the notice until November 2004 to show cause why CESCOs distribution license should not be revoked. In response, CESCO submitted a business plan to the OERC. In February 2005, the OERC issued an order rejecting the proposed business plan. The order also stated that the CESCO distribution license would be revoked if an acceptable business plan for CESCO was not submitted to and approved by the OERC prior to March 31, 2005. In its April 2, 2005 order, the OERC revoked the CESCO distribution license. CESCO has filed an appeal against the April 2, 2005 OERC order and that appeal remains pending in the Indian courts. In addition, Gridco asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Companys indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCOs financial obligations to Gridco. In December 2001, Gridco served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limited (AES ODPL), and Jyoti Structures (Jyoti) pursuant to the terms of the CESCO Shareholders Agreement between Gridco, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and CESCO (the CESCO arbitration). In the arbitration, Gridco appeared to be seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by Gridco. The Company counterclaimed against Gridco for damages. In June 2007, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting Gridcos claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to Gridco. The respondents counterclaims were also rejected. In September 2007, Gridco filed a challenge of the arbitration award with the local Indian court. In June 2008, Gridco filed a separate application with the local Indian court for an order enjoining the Company from selling or otherwise transferring its shares in Orissa Power Generation Corporation Ltd.s (OPGC), an equity method investment, and requiring the Company to provide security in the amount of the contested damages in the CESCO arbitration until Gridcos challenge to the arbitration award is resolved. In June 2010, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal awarded the Company some of its costs relating to the arbitration. In August 2010, Gridco filed a challenge of the cost award with the local Indian court. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In early 2002, Gridco made an application to the OERC requesting that the OERC initiate proceedings regarding the terms of OPGCs existing PPA with Gridco. In response, OPGC filed a petition in the Indian courts to block any such OERC proceedings. In early 2005, the Orissa High Court upheld the OERCs jurisdiction to initiate such proceedings as requested by Gridco. OPGC appealed that High Courts decision to the Supreme Court and sought stays of both the High Courts decision and the underlying OERC proceedings regarding the PPAs terms. In April 2005, the Supreme Court granted OPGCs requests and ordered stays of the High Courts decision and the OERC proceedings with respect to the PPAs terms. The matter is awaiting further hearing. 99 Table of Contents Unless the Supreme Court finds in favor of OPGCs appeal or otherwise prevents the OERCs proceedings regarding the PPAs terms, the OERC will likely lower the tariff payable to OPGC under the PPA, which would have an adverse impact on OPGCs financials. OPGC believes that it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In March 2003, the office of the Federal Public Prosecutor for the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (MPF) notified AES Eletropaulo that it had commenced an inquiry related to the BNDES financings provided to AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and the rationing loan provided to Eletropaulo, changes in the control of Eletropaulo, sales of assets by Eletropaulo and the quality of service provided by Eletropaulo to its customers, and requested various documents from Eletropaulo relating to these matters. In July 2004, the MPF filed a public civil lawsuit in the Federal Court of S&atilde;o Paulo (FSCP) alleging that BNDES violated Law 8429/92 (the Administrative Misconduct Act) and BNDESs internal rules by: (1) approving the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (2) extending the payment terms on the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (3) authorizing the sale of Eletropaulos preferred shares at a stock market auction; (4) accepting Eletropaulos preferred shares to secure the loan provided to Eletropaulo; and (5) allowing the restructurings of Light Servi&ccedil;os de Eletricidade S.A. and Eletropaulo. The MPF also named AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s as defendants in the lawsuit because they allegedly benefited from BNDESs alleged violations. In May 2006, the FCSP ruled that the MPF could pursue its claims based on the first, second, and fourth alleged violations noted above. The MPF subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal with the Federal Court of Appeals (FCA) seeking to require the FCSP to consider all five alleged violations. Also, in July 2006, AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s filed an interlocutory appeal with the FCA, which was subsequently consolidated with the MPFs interlocutory appeal, seeking a transfer of venue and to enjoin the FCSP from considering any of the alleged violations. In June 2009, the FCA granted the injunction sought by AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and transferred the case to the Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro. In May 2010, the MPF filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice challenging the transfer. The MPFs lawsuit before the FCSP has been stayed pending a final decision on the interlocutory appeals. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana (the successor of AES Transg&aacute;s) believe they have meritorious defenses to the allegations asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. AES Florestal, Ltd. (Florestal), had been operating a pole factory and had other assets, including a wooded area known as Horto Renner, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (collectively, Property). Florestal had been under the control of AES Sul (Sul) since October 1997, when Sul was created pursuant to a privatization by the Government of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. After it came under the control of Sul, Florestal performed an environmental audit of the entire operational cycle at the pole factory. The audit discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at the pole factory. The audit concluded that the prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia El&eacute;trica (CEEE), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. Sul and Florestal subsequently took the initiative of communicating with Brazilian authorities, as well as CEEE, about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. The Public Attorneys Office has initiated a civil inquiry (Civil Inquiry n. 24/05) to investigate potential civil liability and has requested that the police station of Triunfo institute a police investigation (IP number 1041/05) to investigate potential criminal liability regarding the contamination at the pole factory. The parties filed defenses in response to the civil inquiry. The Public Attorneys Office then requested an injunction which the judge rejected on September 26, 2008. The Public Attorneys office has a right to appeal the decision. The environmental agency (FEPAM) has also started a procedure (Procedure n. 088200567/059) to analyze the measures that shall be taken to contain and remediate the contamination. Also, in March 2000, Sul filed suit against CEEE in the 2nd Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre seeking to register in Suls name the Property that it acquired through the privatization but that remained registered in CEEEs name. During those proceedings, AES subsequently waived its claim to re register the Property and asserted a claim to recover the amounts paid for the Property. That claim is pending. In November 2005, the 7th Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre ruled that the Property must be returned to CEEE. CEEE has had sole possession of Horto Renner since September 2006 and of the rest of the Property since April 2006. In February 2008, Sul 100 Table of Contents and CEEE signed a Technical Cooperation Protocol pursuant to which they requested a new deadline from FEPAM in order to present a proposal. In March 2008, the State Prosecution office filed a Public Class Action against AES Florestal, AES Sul and CEEE, requiring an injunction for the removal of the alleged sources of contamination and the payment of an indemnity in the amount of R$6 million ($4 million). The injunction was rejected and the case is in the evidentiary stage awaiting the judges determination concerning the production of expert evidence. The above referenced proposal was delivered on April 8, 2008. FEPAM responded by indicating that the parties should undertake the first step of the proposal which would be to retain a contractor. In its response, Sul indicated that such step should be undertaken by CEEE as the relevant environmental events resulted from CEEEs operations. It is estimated that remediation could cost approximately R$14.7 million ($9 million). Discussions between Sul and CEEE are ongoing. In January 2004, the Company received notice of a Formulation of Charges filed against the Company by the Superintendence of Electricity of the Dominican Republic. In the Formulation of Charges, the Superintendence asserts that the existence of three generation companies (Empresa Generadora de Electricidad Itabo, S.A. (Itabo), Dominican Power Partners, and AES Andres BV) and one distribution company (Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S.A. (Este)) in the Dominican Republic, violates certain cross ownership restrictions contained in the General Electricity Law of the Dominican Republic. In February 2004, the Company filed in the First Instance Court of the National District of the Dominican Republic an action seeking injunctive relief based on several constitutional due process violations contained in the Formulation of Charges (Constitutional Injunction). In February 2004, the Court granted the Constitutional Injunction and ordered the immediate cessation of any effects of the Formulation of Charges, and the enactment by the Superintendence of Electricity of a special procedure to prosecute alleged antitrust complaints under the General Electricity Law. In March 2004, the Superintendence of Electricity appealed the Courts decision. In July 2004, the Company divested any interest in Este. The Superintendence of Electricitys appeal is pending. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July 2004, the Corporaci&oacute;n Dominicana de Empresas El&eacute;ctricas Estatales (CDEEE) filed lawsuits against Itabo, an affiliate of the Company, in the First and Fifth Chambers of the Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance for the National District. CDEEE alleges in both lawsuits that Itabo spent more than was necessary to rehabilitate two generation units of an Itabo power plant and, in the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, that those funds were paid to affiliates and subsidiaries of AES Gener and Coastal Itabo, Ltd. (Coastal), a former shareholder of Itabo, without the required approval of Itabos board of administration. In the First Chamber lawsuit, CDEEE seeks an accounting of Itabos transactions relating to the rehabilitation. In November 2004, the First Chamber dismissed the case for lack of legal basis. On appeal, in October 2005 the Court of Appeals of Santo Domingo ruled in Itabos favor, reasoning that it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute because the parties contracts mandated arbitration. The Supreme Court of Justice is considering CDEEEs appeal of the Court of Appeals decision. In the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, which also names Itabos former president as a defendant, CDEEE seeks $15 million in damages and the seizure of Itabos assets. In October 2005, the Fifth Chamber held that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute given the arbitration provisions in the parties contracts. The First Chamber of the Court of Appeal ratified that decision in September 2006. In a related proceeding, in May 2005, Itabo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to compel CDEEE to arbitrate its claims. The petition was denied in July 2005. Itabos appeal of that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has been stayed since September 2006. Further, in September 2006, in an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration, an arbitral tribunal determined that it lacked jurisdiction to decide arbitration claims concerning these disputes. Itabo believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In April 2006, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi (District Court) on behalf of certain individual plaintiffs and all residents and or property owners in the State of Mississippi who allegedly suffered harm as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, whose alleged greenhouse gas emissions contributed to alleged global 101 Table of Contents warming which, in turn, allegedly increased the destructive capacity of Hurricane Katrina. The plaintiffs assert unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy/aiding and abetting, public and private nuisance, trespass, negligence, and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment claims against the defendants. The plaintiffs seek damages relating to loss of property, loss of business, clean up costs, personal injuries and death, but do not quantify their alleged damages. In August 2007, the District Court dismissed the case. The plaintiffs subsequently appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which, in October 2009, affirmed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs unjust enrichment, fraudulent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy claims. However, the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence claims, and remanded those claims to the District Court for further proceedings. In February 2010, the Fifth Circuit granted the petitions for en banc rehearing filed by the Company and other defendants, and thereby vacated its October 2009 decision. In May 2010, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had lost its quorum for en banc review. In August 2010, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the U.S. Supreme Court, requesting the Supreme Court to direct the Fifth Circuit to reinstate the appeal and return it to the panel that issued the October 2009 decision. In January 2011, the Supreme Court denied the petition, ending the case. In July 2007, the Competition Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the Competition Committee) ordered Nurenergoservice, an AES subsidiary, to pay approximately KZT 18 billion ($120 million) for alleged antimonopoly violations in 2005 through the first quarter of 2007. The Competition Committees order was affirmed by the economic court in April 2008 (April 2008 Decision). The economic court also issued an injunction to secure Nurenergoservices alleged liability, freezing Nurenergoservices bank accounts and prohibiting Nurenergoservice from transferring or disposing of its property. Nurenergoservices subsequent appeals to the court of appeals were rejected. In February 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency (the Competition Committees successor) seized approximately KZT 783 million ($5 million) from a frozen Nurenergoservice bank account in partial satisfaction of Nurenergoservices alleged damages liability. However, on appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court, in October 2009, the Supreme Court annulled the decisions of the lower courts because of procedural irregularities and remanded the case to the economic court for reconsideration. On remand, in January 2010, the economic court reaffirmed its April 2008 Decision. Nurenergoservices appeals in the court of appeals (first panel) and the court of appeals (second panel) were unsuccessful. Nurenergoservice intends to file a further appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court. In separate but related proceedings, in August 2007, the Competition Committee ordered Nurenergoservice to pay approximately KZT 1.8 billion ($12 million) in administrative fines for its alleged antimonopoly violations. Nurenergoservices appeal to the administrative court was rejected in February 2009. Given the adverse court decisions against Nurenergoservice, the Antimonopoly Agency may attempt to seize Nurenergoservices remaining assets, which are immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Antimonopoly Agency has not indicated whether it intends to assert claims against Nurenergoservice for alleged antimonopoly violations post first quarter 2007. Nurenergoservice believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it; however, there can be no assurances that it will prevail in these proceedings. In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of the power sales of Ust Kamenogorsk HPP (UK HPP) and Shulbinsk HPP, hydroelectric plants under AES concession (collectively, the Hydros), in January through February 2009. The investigation of Shulbinsk HPP is ongoing, but the investigation of UK HPP has been completed. The Antimonopoly Agency determined that UK HPP abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power in January through February 2009. The Agency sought an order from the administrative court requiring UK HPP to pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 120 million ($1 million) and to disgorge profits for the period at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately KZT 440 million ($3 million). No fines or damages have been paid to date, however, as the proceedings in the administrative court have been suspended due to the initiation of related criminal proceedings against officials of UK HPP. The Hydros believe they have meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. 102 Table of Contents In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of Ust Kamenogorsk TETS LLPs (UKT) power sales in 2008 through February 2009. The Antimonopoly Agency subsequently concluded that UKT abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power and should pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 136 million ($1 million). The Antimonopoly Agency later sought an order from the administrative court requiring UKT to pay the fine. The administrative court proceedings have been suspended due to a related criminal investigation of UKT employees. If the investigation is terminated and the Antimonopoly Agency prevails in the administrative proceedings, UKT may be ordered to pay the administrative fine and disgorge the profits from the sales at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately 514 million KZT ($3 million). UKT believes it has meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In December 2007, an arbitral tribunal terminated ESSAs gas supply contracts with members of the Sierra Chata Consortium in light of the restrictions that had been placed on the export of gas by the Argentine Republic. ESSA thereafter terminated its gas transportation contract with Transportadora de Gas del Norte S.A. (TGN), and initiated arbitration seeking relief from the obligation to pay the firm tariff under ESSAs gas transportation contracts with Gasoducto GasAndes (Argentina) S.A. (GasAndes Argentina) and Gasoducto GasAndes S.A. (GasAndes Chile) or in the alternative, termination of such contracts. TGN (which later filed a lawsuit against ESSA in Argentina), GasAndes Argentina, and GasAndes Chile disputed that the restrictions on the export of gas justified the adjustment or termination of the respective gas transportation contracts and sought due tariff payments. On December 29, 2010, ESSA reached settlement agreements with GasAndes Argentina, GasAndes Chile, and TGN terminating the respective gas transportation contracts and resolving all pending legal disputes and potential future claims. ESSA recognized approximately $72 million as other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2010 related to the settlement agreements. Upon termination of the TGN gas transportation contract, ESSA is no longer required to pay certain charges imposed by the Argentine Republic relating to gas supply infrastructure. In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina, Alaska, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, claiming that the defendants alleged GHG emissions have contributed to alleged global warming which, in turn, allegedly has led to the erosion of the plaintiffs alleged land. The plaintiffs assert nuisance and concert of action claims against the Company and the other defendants, and a conspiracy claim against a subset of the other defendants. The plaintiffs seek to recover relocation costs, indicated in the complaint to be from $95 million to $400 million, and other unspecified damages from the defendants. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the District Court granted in October 2009. The plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The parties have briefed the appeal and are awaiting a date for oral argument. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July, 1993 the Public Attorneys office filed a claim against Eletropaulo, the Sao Paulo State Government, SABESP (a state owned company), CETESB (a state owned company) and DAEE (the municipal Water and Electric Energy Department) alleging that they were liable for pollution of the Billings Reservoir as a result of pumping water from the Pinheiros River into the Billings Reservoir. The events in question occurred while Eletropaulo was a state owned company. An initial lower court decision in 2007 found the parties liable for the payment of approximately R$670 million ($401 million) for remediation. Eletropaulo subsequently appealed the decision to the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo which reversed the lower court decision. In 2009, the Public Attorneys Office has filed appeals to both Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) and the Supreme Court (SC) and such appeals were answered by Eletropaulo in the fourth quarter of 2009. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 1996, a public civil action was asserted against Eletropaulo and Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Desportiva Cultural Eletropaulo (the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o) relating to alleged environmental damage caused by construction of the 103 Table of Contents Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o near Guarapiranga Reservoir. The initial decision that was upheld by the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo in 2006 found that Eletropaulo should repair the alleged environmental damage by demolishing certain construction and reforesting the area, and either sponsor an environmental project which would cost approximately R$1 million ($599 thousand) as of December 31, 2010, or pay an indemnification amount of approximately R$10.2 million ($6 million). Eletropaulo has appealed this decision to the Supreme Court and is awaiting a decision. In February 2009, a CAA Section 114 information request from the EPA regarding Cayuga and Somerset was received. The request seeks various operating and testing data and other information regarding certain types of projects at the Cayuga and Somerset facilities, generally for the time period from January 1, 2000 through the date of the information request. This type of information request has been used in the past to assist the EPA in determining whether a plant is in compliance with applicable standards under the CAA. Cayuga and Somerset responded to the EPAs information request in June 2009, and they are awaiting a response from the EPA regarding their submittal. At this time, it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this request may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position. On February 2, 2009, the Cayuga facility received a Notice of Violation from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) that the facility had exceeded the permitted volume limit of coal ash that can be disposed of in the on site landfill. Cayuga has met with NYSDEC and submitted a Landfill Liner Demonstration Report to them. Such report found that the landfill has adequate engineering integrity to support the additional coal ash and there is no inherent environmental threat. NYSDEC has indicated they accept the finding of the report. A permit modification was approved by the NYSDEC on May 14, 2010 and such permit modification allows for closure of this approximately 10 acre portion of the landfill. The construction in accordance with the approved permit modification was completed in November 2010 and the certification report for this construction project is currently being drafted to submit to the NYSDEC in the second quarter of 2011. While at this time it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this matter may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position, based upon the discussions to date, the Company does not believe the impact will be material. In March 2009, AES Uruguaiana Empreendimentos S.A. (AESU) initiated arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against YPF S.A. (YPF) seeking damages and other relief relating to YPFs breach of the parties gas supply agreement (GSA). Thereafter, in April 2009, YPF initiated arbitration in the ICC against AESU and two unrelated parties, Companhia de Gas do Esado do Rio Grande do Sul and Transportador de Gas del Mercosur S.A. (TGM), claiming that AESU wrongfully terminated the GSA and caused the termination of a transportation agreement (TA) between YPF and TGM (YPF Arbitration). YPF seeks an unspecified amount of damages from AESU, a declaration that YPFs performance was excused under the GSA due to certain alleged force majeure events, or, in the alternative, a declaration that the GSA and the TA should be terminated without a finding of liability against YPF because of the allegedly onerous obligations imposed on YPF by those agreements. In addition, in the YPF Arbitration, TGM asserts that if it is determined that AESU is responsible for the termination of the GSA, AESU is liable for TGMs alleged losses, including losses under the TA. The procedural schedules for the arbitrations have been established but the hearing dates have not been scheduled to date. AESU believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit 104 Table of Contents was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. In June 2009, the Inter American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States (IACHR) requested that the Republic of Panama suspend the construction of AES Changuinola S.A.s hydroelectric project (Project) until the bodies of the Inter American human rights system can issue a final decision on a petition (286/08) claiming that the construction violates the human rights of alleged indigenous communities. In July 2009, Panama responded by informing the IACHR that it would not suspend construction of the Project and requesting that the IACHR revoke its request. In June 2010, the Inter American Court of Human Rights vacated the IACHRs request. With respect to the merits of the underlying petition, the IACHR heard arguments by the communities and Panama in November 2009, but has not issued a decision to date. The Company cannot predict Panamas response to any determination on the merits of the petition by the bodies of the Inter American human rights system. In July 2009, AES Energ&iacute;a Cartagena S.R.L. (AES Cartagena) received notices from the Spanish national energy regulator, Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de Energ&iacute;a (CNE), stating that the proceeds of the sale of electricity from AES Cartagenas plant should be reduced by roughly the value of the CO2 allowances that were granted to AES Cartagena for free for the years 2007, 2008, and the first half of 2009. In particular, the notices stated that CNE intended to invoice AES Cartagena to recover that value, which CNE calculated as approximately 20 million ($27 million) for 2007 2008 and an amount to be determined for the first half of 2009. In September 2009, AES Cartagena received invoices for 523,548 (approximately $694,000) for the allowances granted for free for 2007 and 19,907,248 (approximately $26 million) for 2008. In July 2010, AES Cartagena received an invoice for approximately 5.4 million ($7 million) for the allowances granted for free for the first half of 2009. AES Cartagena does not expect to be charged for CO2 allowances issued free of charge for subsequent periods. AES Cartagena has paid the amounts invoiced and has filed challenges to the CNEs demands in the Spanish judicial system. There can be no assurances that the challenges will be successful. AES Cartagena has demanded indemnification from its fuel supply and electricity toller, GDF Suez, in relation to the CNE invoices under the long term energy agreement (the Energy Agreement) with GDF Suez. However, GDF Suez has disputed that it is responsible for the CNE invoices under the Energy Agreement. Therefore, in September 2009, AES Cartagena initiated arbitration against GDF Suez, seeking to recover the payments made to CNE. In the arbitration, AES Cartagena also seeks a determination that GDF Suez is responsible for procuring and bearing the cost of CO2 allowances that are required to offset the CO2 emissions of AES Cartagenas power plant, which is also in dispute between the parties. To date, AES Cartagena has paid approximately 20 million ($27 million) for the CO2 allowances that have been required to offset 2008 and 2009 CO2 emissions. AES Cartagena expects that allowances will need to be purchased to offset emissions for subsequent years. The evidentiary hearing in the arbitration took place from May 31 June 4, 2010, and closing arguments were heard on September 1, 2010. In February 2011, the arbitral tribunal requested further briefing from the parties on certain issues in the arbitration. If AES Cartagena does not prevail in the arbitration and is required to bear the cost of carbon compliance, its results of operations could be materially adversely affected and, in turn, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company and its results of operations. AES Cartagena believes it has meritorious claims and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 2009, the Public Defenders Office of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (PDO) filed a class action against AES Sul in the 16th District Court of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (District Court), claiming that AES Sul has been illegally passing PIS and COFINS taxes (taxes based on AES Suls income) to consumers. According to ANEELs Order No. 93/05, the federal laws of Brazil, and the Brazilian Constitution, energy companies such as AES Sul are entitled to highlight PIS and COFINS taxes in power bills to final consumers, as the cost of those taxes is included in the energy tariffs that are applicable to final consumers. Before AES Sul had 105 Table of Contents been served with the action, the District Court dismissed the lawsuit in October 2009 on the ground that AES Sul had been properly highlighting PIS and COFINS taxes in consumer bills in accordance with Brazilian law. In April 2010, the PDO appealed to the Appellate Court of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (AC). In November 2010, the AC affirmed the dismissal. The PDO is expected to appeal. If the dismissal is ever reversed and AES Sul does not prevail in the lawsuit and is ordered to cease recovering PIS and COFINS taxes pursuant to its energy tariff, its potential prospective losses could be approximately R$9.6 million ($6 million) per month, as estimated by AES Sul. In addition, if AES Sul is ordered to reimburse consumers, its potential retrospective liability could be approximately R$1.2 billion ($718 million), as estimated by AES Sul. AES Sul believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings if it is served with the action; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in its efforts. Furthermore, if AES Sul does not prevail in the litigation it will seek to adjust its energy tariff to compensate it for its losses, but there can be no assurances that it would be successful in obtaining an adjusted energy tariff. In October 2009, IPL received a Notice of Violation (NOV) and Finding of Violation from EPA pursuant to CAA Section 113(a). The NOV alleges violations of the CAA at IPLs three coal fired electric generating facilities dating back to 1986. The alleged violations primarily pertain to EPAs Prevention of Significant Deterioration and nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) requirements under the CAA. Since receiving the letter, IPL management has met with EPA staff and is currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of similar cases have required companies to pay civil penalties and to install additional pollution control technology on coal fired electric generating units. A similar outcome in this case could have a material impact to IPL and could, in turn, have a material impact on the Company. IPL would seek recovery through customer rates of any operating or capital expenditures related to pollution control technology systems to reduce regulated air emissions; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in that regard. In November 2009, April 2010 and December 2010, substantially similar personal injury lawsuits were filed by a total of 26 residents and estates in the Dominican Republic against the Company, AES Atlantis, Inc., AES Puerto Rico, LP, AES Puerto Rico, Inc., and AES Puerto Rico Services, Inc., in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware. In each lawsuit the plaintiffs allege that the coal combustion byproducts of AES Puerto Ricos power plant were illegally placed in the Dominican Republic in October 2003 through March 2004 and subsequently caused the plaintiffs birth defects, other personal injuries, and or deaths. The plaintiffs do not quantify their alleged damages, but generally allege that they are entitled to compensatory and punitive damages. The AES defendants have moved for partial dismissal of both the November 2009 and April 2010 lawsuits on various grounds. (The AES Defendants have until mid February to respond to the December 2010 lawsuit.) In September 2010, the Superior Court heard arguments on the motions. The Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs fraud allegations without prejudice to replead, and the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in November 2010. The AES defendants have filed a renewed motion to dismiss the amended issues. The remaining claims (other than fraud) addressed in the AES defendants original motion to dismiss are still pending. The AES defendants believe they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. On December 21, 2010, AES 3C Maritza East 1 EOOD, which owns an unfinished 670MW lignite fired power plant in Bulgaria, made the first in a series of demands on the performance bond securing the construction Contractors obligations under the parties EPC Contract. The Contractor failed to complete the plant on schedule. The total amount demanded by Maritza under the performance bond is approximately 155 million ($205 million). However, the Contractor obtained a temporary injunction from a French court preventing the issuing bank from honoring the bond demands. As the performance bond is governed by English law, Maritza obtained a judgment from an English court that the bond should be paid, and then presented this judgment to the French court which issued the temporary injunction. However, on February 10, 2011, the French court issued a decision enjoining the issuing bank from honoring the demands on the performance bond pending the determination of the arbitration between Maritza and the Contractor, described below. Maritza is attempting to 106 Table of Contents lift that injunction or otherwise obtain payment on its demands. In addition, in December 2010, the Contractor issued a notice of dispute alleging that the lignite that has been supplied by Maritza for commissioning of the power plant is out of specification, allegedly entitling the Contractor to an extension of time to complete the power plant, an increase to the contract price of approximately 62 million ($82 million), and other relief. The Contractor thereafter advised Maritza that it had stopped commissioning of the power plants two units because of the characteristics of the lignite supplied, and, in January 2011, initiated arbitration on its lignite claim. Maritza disputes that the lignite is out of specification and intends to defend the arbitration and assert counterclaims for delay liquidated damages and other relief relating to the Contractors failure to complete the power plant and other breaches of the EPC contract. Maritza believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. ITEM 4. REMOVED AND RESERVED 107 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On March 12, 2010, the Company and Terrific Investment Corporation (Investor), a wholly owned subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, entered into a stockholder agreement (the Stockholder Agreement) in connection with the agreement discussed in the following paragraph. Under the Stockholder Agreement, as long as Investor holds more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, Investor will have the right to designate one nominee, who must be reasonably acceptable to the Board, for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. Investor has not designated its nominee for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, until such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock, Investor has agreed to vote its shares in accordance with the recommendation of the Company on any matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company relating to the election of directors and compensation matters. Otherwise, Investor may vote its shares at its discretion. Further, under the Stockholder Agreement, Investor will be subject to a standstill restriction which generally prohibits Investor from purchasing additional securities of the Company beyond the level acquired by it under the stock purchase agreement entered into between Investor and the Company on November 6, 2009. In addition, Investor has agreed to a lock up restriction such that Investor would not sell its shares for a period of 12 months following the closing, subject to certain exceptions. The standstill and lock up restrictions also terminate at such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock. Investor will have certain registration rights and preemptive rights under the Stockholder Agreement with respect to its shares of common stock of the Company. On March 15, 2010, the Company completed the sale of 125,468,788 shares of common stock to Investor. The shares were sold for $12.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.58 billion. Investors ownership in the Companys common stock is now approximately 15% of the Companys total outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers In July 2010, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $500 million of AES common stock. The Board authorization permits the Company to repurchase stock through a variety of methods, including open market repurchases and or privately negotiated transactions. The original authorization was set to expire on December 31, 2010, however; in December 2010, the Board authorized an extension of the stock repurchase program. There can be no assurance as to the amount, timing or prices of repurchases, which may vary based on market conditions and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2010, shares of common stock repurchased under this plan totaled 8,382,825 at a total cost of $99 million plus a nominal amount of commissions (average of $11.86 per share including commissions). There was $401 million remaining under the stock repurchase program available for future repurchases at December 31, 2010. 108 Table of Contents The following table presents information regarding purchases made by The AES Corporation of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2010: Repurchase Period Total Numberof SharesPurchased Average PricePaid per Share Total Number of SharesRepurchased as Partof a Publicly AnnouncedRepurchase Plan Dollar Value of MaximumNumber of Shares To BePurchased Under the Plan 10/1/10 10/31/10 6,086,345 $ 12.30 6,086,345 $ 409,713,649 11/1/10 11/30/10 $ $ 409,713,649 12/1/10 12/31/10 755,000 $ 11.89 755,000 $ 400,732,931 Total 6,841,345 $ 12.26 6,841,345 Market Information Our common stock is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol AES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business We are a global power company. We operate two primary lines of business. The first is our Generation business, where we own and or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities, other intermediaries and certain end users. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our Generation and Utilities businesses comprised approximately 45% and 55% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We are also continuing to expand our wind and solar generation businesses. These initiatives are not material contributors to our operating results at this time, but we believe that certain of these initiatives may become material in the future. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10 K. Our Organization and Segments. Our management reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively EMEA), each managed by a regional president. The financial reporting segment structure uses our management reporting structure as its foundation and reflects how we manage the business internally. Based on our application of the segment reporting accounting guidance, which provides certain quantitative thresholds and aggregation criteria, we have concluded that the Company has the following six reportable segments: Latin America Generation; Latin America Utilities; North America Generation; North America Utilities; Europe Generation; Asia Generation. We report the Companys Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation, Wind Generation and Climate Solutions operating segments within Corporate and Other because they do not meet the criteria to allow for aggregation with another operating segment or the quantitative thresholds that would require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. None of these operating segments are currently material to our financial statement presentation of reportable segments, individually or in the aggregate. Corporate and Other also includes corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments and other intercompany charges such as self insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company modified its internal reporting structure to move the management of the Companys generation business in Jordan, Amman East, from Asia to Europe. Accordingly, Amman East is now reported within the Europe Generation segment. All prior periods have been retrospectively restated to reflect this change and conform to current period presentation. Key Drivers of Our Results of Operations. Our Generation and Utilities businesses are distinguished by the nature of their customers, operational differences, cost structure, regulatory environment and risk exposure. As a result, each line of business has slightly different drivers which affect operating results. Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other things, plant reliability and efficiency, power prices, volume, 113 Table of Contents management of fixed and variable operating costs, management of working capital including collection of receivables, and the extent to which our plants have hedged their exposure to currency and commodities such as fuel. For our Generation businesses which sell power under short term contracts or in the spot market, the most crucial factors are the current market price of electricity and the marginal costs of production. Growth in our Generation business is largely tied to securing new PPAs, expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building or acquiring new power plants. Performance drivers for our Utilities businesses include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; management of working capital, including collection of receivables; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive regulatory requirements; and in developing countries, reduction of commercial and technical losses. The operating results of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth and weather conditions in areas in which they operate. In addition to these drivers, as further explained below, the Company also has exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. One of the key factors which affect our Generation business is our ability to enter into contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of fuel used to produce that electricity. Long term contracts are intended to reduce exposure to volatility associated with fuel prices in the market and the price of electricity by fixing the revenue and costs for these businesses. The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. In turn, most of these businesses enter into long term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. While these long term contractual agreements reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel, the predictability of operating results and cash flows vary by business based on the extent to which a facilitys generation capacity and fuel requirements are contracted and the negotiated terms of these agreements. Entering into these contracts exposes us to counterparty credit risk. For further discussion of these risks, see Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. When fuel costs increase, many of our businesses are able to pass these costs on to their customers. Generation businesses with long term contracts in place do this by including fuel pass through or fuel indexing arrangements in their contracts. Utilities businesses can pass costs on to their customers through increases in current or future tariff rates. Therefore, in a rising fuel cost environment, the increased fuel costs for these businesses often result in an increase in revenue to the extent these costs can be passed through (though not necessarily on a one for one basis). Conversely, in a declining fuel cost environment, the decreased fuel costs can result in a decrease in revenue. Increases or decreases in revenue at these businesses that have the ability to pass through costs to the customer have a corresponding impact on cost of sales, to the extent the costs can be passed through, resulting in a limited impact on gross margin, if any. Although these circumstances may not have a large impact on gross margin, they can significantly affect gross margin as a percentage of revenue. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of revenue is a less relevant measure when evaluating our operating performance. To the extent our businesses are unable to pass through fuel cost increases to their customers, gross margin may be adversely affected. Global diversification also helps us mitigate risk. Our presence in mature markets helps mitigate the exposure associated with our businesses in emerging markets. Additionally, our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, water (hydroelectric power), wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. However, to the extent the mix of fuel sources enabling our generation capabilities in any one market is not diversified, the spread in costs of different fuels or the availability of natural resources such as water for hydroelectric power production or wind may also influence the operating performance and the ability of our subsidiaries to compete within that market. For example, in a market where gas prices fall to a low level compared to coal prices, power prices may be set by low gas prices which can affect the profitability of our coal plants in that market. In certain cases, we may attempt to hedge fuel prices to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, we only hedge a 114 Table of Contents portion of our currency and commodity risks, and our businesses are still subject to these risks, as further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. Commodity and power price volatility could continue to impact our financial metrics to the extent this volatility is not hedged. For a discussion of our sensitivities to commodity, currency and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Form 10 K. Due to our global presence, the Company has significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure is primarily associated with the impact of the translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results from their local currency to U.S. Dollars that is required for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, there is foreign currency transaction exposure when an entity enters into transactions, including debt agreements, in currencies other than their functional currency. These risks are further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. During 2010, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a significant impact on our operating results. If the current foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues, our gross margin and other financial metrics could continue to be affected. Another key driver of our results is our ability to bring new businesses into commercial operation successfully. We currently have approximately 1,300 MW of projects under construction in eight countries. Our prospects for improved operating results and cash flows are dependent upon successful completion of these projects on time and within budget. However, as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties, construction is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with site identification, financing, permitting and our ability to meet construction deadlines. Delays or the inability to complete projects and commence commercial operations can result in increased costs, impairment of assets and other challenges involving partners and counterparties to our construction agreements, PPAs and other agreements. Our gross margin is also impacted by the fact that in each country in which we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity, and environmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business. Regulations differ on a country by country basis (and even at the state and local municipality levels) and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country, and affect many aspects of our operations and development projects. Our ability to negotiate tariffs, enter into long term contracts, pass through costs related to capital expenditures and otherwise navigate these regulations can have an impact on our revenue, costs and gross margin. Environmental and land use regulations, including existing and proposed regulation of GHG emissions, could substantially increase our capital expenditures or other compliance costs, which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. For a further discussion of the Regulatory Environment, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments Environmental, included in Item 8. Financial Statements, Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated with Government Regulation and Laws of this Form 10 K. Key Drivers of Results in 2010 In 2010, the Companys gross margin and cash flow from operations increased $531 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, while net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million compared to the prior year. During 2010, our North American generation businesses continued to face challenges associated with relatively lower gas prices and a decline in power prices relative to coal and other fuel. In particular, lower gas and power prices have affected the generation volume and financial results of our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas which are merchant businesses and not subject to PPAs. We expect 115 Table of Contents this trend to continue. In 2010, these challenges were partially mitigated by hedging arrangements. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Impairments below. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Despite these challenges, many of our financial measures have improved when compared to 2009. Gross margin increased due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation caused by a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies in 2010 and better operating performance at certain businesses. For instance, certain of the Companys Latin American businesses experienced continued increases in market demand due to the local economic recovery in Latin America. The Company also benefited from higher demand and favorable market conditions at Masinloc, our generation business in the Philippines. Masinlocs higher availability enabled the Company to benefit from increased contract and spot market sales and favorable market prices in the Philippines. In addition, cash provided by operating activities increased due to the improved operating results at Latin America generation businesses and Masinloc; contributions from the consolidation of Cartagena and the Ballylumford acquisition in 2010; and changes in working capital in Latin America. Despite the increase in gross margin in 2010, net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased primarily from the impact of long lived asset impairments recognized related to four businesses: Eastern Energy in New York, Southland in California, Tisza II in Hungary and Deepwater in Texas. These were partially offset by gains from the sale of our discontinued businesses in Oman and Qatar and a decrease in goodwill impairment charges. In 2011, we expect to face continued challenges in our business, including the trends in North America described above. In addition, the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and commodity prices on our operations may continue into 2011. In 2011, the components of the tariff reset in Brazil and its potential impact on our Brazilian utilities are uncertain at this time and we expect continued challenges in our merchant businesses such as those in the U.S., Hungary and Northern Ireland. However, management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses and growth from new businesses acquired, that commenced operations in 2010 or are expected to commence operations in 2011, may lessen or offset the impact of these challenges described above, as they did in 2010. However, if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described above or elsewhere in this section impact us more than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our gross margin and net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In addition, we do not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. Such cash flows may be influenced by the operating challenges presented above and will also not include the cash flows from operations which were sold in 2010 or the increases experienced from the cash flows provided by the initial consolidation of Cartagena, the acquisition of Ballylumford and several working capital transactions at our Latin American utilities in 2010 as discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity. The following briefly describes the key changes in our reported revenue, gross margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, Adjusted Earnings per Share (a non GAAP measure) and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Results of Operations and Segment Analysis discussion within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. 116 Table of Contents Performance Highlights Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 Gross Margin $ 3,964 $ 3,433 $ 3,568 Net Income Attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share from Continuing Operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (a non GAAP measure)(1) $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 3,510 $ 2,202 $ 2,160 (1) See reconciliation and definition below under Non GAAP Measure. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue increased $2.7 billion, or 19%, to $16.6 billion in 2010 compared with $14.0 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $805 million; increased volume and rates at our Brazilian utilities attributable to increased demand due to the recovery of the local economy and the favorable impact of the June 2009 tariff reset; the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010; the favorable impact of rates at our generation businesses in Argentina; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; higher demand at Gener in Chile; the impact of the Companys new business in Northern Ireland, acquired in August 2010; and higher demand and rates at Indianapolis Power and Light. Gross margin increased $531 million, or 15%, to $4.0 billion in 2010 compared with $3.4 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $219 million; an increase in demand at our generation and utilities businesses in Latin America; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; and the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs in Latin America, largely driven by bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil in 2009 that did not recur; and lower rates at our generation businesses in New York. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million to $9 million in 2010, compared to $658 million in 2009. Key drivers of the decrease included: Impairment losses in New York related to our Eastern Energy facilities, in California related to our Southland (Huntington Beach) generation facility, in Hungary related to our Tisza II generation facility and in Texas related to our Deepwater facility; 117 Table of Contents A decrease in gain on sale of investments due to the sale of our businesses in Northern Kazakhstan which occurred in 2009; and A decrease in other income due to the reduction in interest and penalties in 2009 associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the Programa de Recuperacao Fiscal (REFIS) program and a favorable court decision in 2009 enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by: The gain on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of Barka which occurred in August 2010; An increase in net equity in earnings of affiliates partially offset by income tax expense related to the sale of the Companys indirect investment in Companhia Energ&eacute;tica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Lower impairment expenses related to a goodwill impairment of our business in Kilroot that occurred in 2009; Lower income tax expense due to 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries; and An increase in gross margin as described above. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion, or 59%, to $3.5 billion in 2010 compared with $2.2 billion in 2009. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $837 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased tax payments in 2009 associated with a tax amnesty program of $326 million, higher working capital requirements during 2009 related to payments on the settlement of swap agreements of $65 million and in 2010, a $50 million decrease in employer contributions to pension plans and lower payments for contingencies; an increase of $215 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to the higher gross margin in 2010 combined with improved working capital mainly as a result of higher collections of value added taxes and accounts receivable; an increase of $99 million at Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher gross margin; and an increase of $58 million as a result of our consolidation of Cartagena in 2010 and the acquisition of Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $136 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations of businesses sold in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of businesses sold was $33 million and will not recur in 2011. In 2010 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities at our Latin American Utilities businesses included several items such as the tax amnesty program and settlement of swap agreements, as described above, that are not expected to recur. In addition, 2010 net cash provided by operating activities benefited from the one time cash savings related to the utilization of tax credits received as a result of the REFIS program. As such, the Company does not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. 118 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue decreased $1.2 billion, or 8%, to $14.0 billion in 2009 compared with $15.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $997 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; decreases in volume at Uruguaiana due to the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold, as well as in New York and Hungary and lower dispatch in Northern Ireland due to unfavorable gas prices compared to coal; the impact of lower spot and contract energy prices at our generation business in Chile; and lower energy prices and volume at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase in tariff rates at our utilities businesses in Latin America primarily reflecting the recovery of energy purchases that were passed through to our customers. Gross margin decreased $135 million, or 4%, to $3.4 billion in 2009 compared with $3.6 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $218 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; lower energy prices and higher purchased energy costs at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic and Argentina; increased pension costs in Brazil and the U.S.; and lower volume in New York due to lower spot market rates. These decreases were partially offset by: improved operating performance at our generation businesses in Chile and the Philippines; higher tariffs in Brazil and El Salvador; and bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $576 million to $658 million in 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: a gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Northern Kazakhstan partially offset by a performance incentive bonus recognized in 2009 for management services provided to these subsidiaries and a settlement upon termination of the management agreement in 2009; the reduction in gross margin in 2009 as described above; and higher impairment expenses in 2009 as a result of an impairment of goodwill at Kilroot in Northern Ireland, and an impairment recognized on our assets in Pakistan which is reflected in discontinued operations, offset by a decline in long lived asset impairment compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by: a reduction in foreign currency transaction losses on net monetary position as a result of reduced losses at our businesses in Chile and the Philippines; a reduction in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates and debt balances in Brazil and favorable foreign currency translation; and lower income tax expenses driven in part by lower pre tax income and a decrease in the effective tax rate from 29% in 2008 to 26% in 2009 due, in part, to tax benefits recorded in 2009 upon the release of 119 Table of Contents valuation allowances at U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recognized in Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. In 2008, the $905 million gain recognized on the sale of our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses had a significant impact on net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In 2009, the Company recognized a performance incentive bonus of $80 million in the first quarter for management services provided to these sold businesses, reflected as other income. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized an additional gain on the sale of the businesses of $98.5 million upon the termination of the management agreement. While the Company engages in the sale of assets and businesses from time to time, the gain or loss recognized in any such sale will depend on a number of factors related to the asset or business that may be sold. Therefore, the Company does not believe that the decline in net income between 2008 and 2009 represents a trend. All of the amounts related to our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses were reported in continuing operations and will not recur in 2010 or future years. Net cash from operating activities increased $42 million, or 2%, to $2.2 billion in 2009 compared with $2.2 billion in 2008. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $238 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to improved working capital management; an increase of $148 million at our Asia Generation businesses due to improved working capital management and improved gross margin; and an increase of $115 million at our Europe Generation businesses primarily due to the collection of the $80 million Kazakhstan management performance incentive bonus in the first quarter 2009. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $391 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased working capital requirements, including the payment of the settlement of a swap agreement, increased tax payments associated with a tax amnesty program and increased payments related to the settlement of contingencies and energy purchases, partially offset by increased operating results; and a decrease of $77 million at our North America Generation businesses, primarily due to reduced operating results. Non GAAP Measure We define adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) mark to market amounts related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) significant gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) significant losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. AES believes that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Companys internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to mark to market gains or losses related to derivative transactions, currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.11 per share. For purposes of measuring loss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be antidilutive. However, for purposes of computing Adjusted 120 Table of Contents EPS (a non GAAP measure), the Company has included the impact of dilutive common stock equivalents as the inclusion of the defined adjustments result in income for Adjusted EPS. The table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in GAAP diluted earnings per share to the weighted average shares used in calculating the non GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Reconciliation of Denominator used for Adjusted Earnings Per Share Loss Shares $ per Share GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Loss from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders $ (86 ) 769 $ (0.11 ) EFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES Stock options 2 Restricted stock units 3 NON GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE $ (86 ) 774 $ (0.11 ) Year Ended December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share 2010 2009 2008 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Derivative mark to market (gains) losses(1) (0.01 ) 0.02 0.05 Currency transaction (gains) losses(2) (0.04 ) (0.04 ) 0.17 Disposition/acquisition (gains) losses (3) (0.19 )(4) (1.27 )(5) Impairment losses 1.07 (6) 0.21 (7) 0.13 (8) Debt retirement (gains) losses 0.03 (9) 0.25 (10) Adjusted earnings per share $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 (1) Derivative mark to market (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (2) Unrealized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (3) The Company has not adjusted for the gain or the related tax effect from the sale of its indirect investment in CEMIG, disclosed in Note 7 Investments in and Advances to Affiliates, in its determination of Adjusted EPS because the gain was recognized by an equity method investee. The Company does not adjust for transactions of its equity method investees in its determination of adjusted EPS. (4) Amount includes: Kazakhstan gain of $98 million, or $0.15 per share, related to the termination of a management agreement as well as a gain of $13 million, or $0.02 per share, related to the reversal of a withholding tax contingency. In addition, there was a gain on sale associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China of $14 million, or $0.02 per share. There were no taxes associated with any of these transactions. (5) Amount includes: Net gain on Kazakhstan sale of $905 million, or $1.31 per share, and net loss on sale of subsidiary interests in Gener of $31 million, or $0.04 per share. There was no income tax impact associated with these transactions. (6) Amount primarily includes asset impairments at Eastern Energy of $827 million, Southland (Huntington Beach) of $200 million, Tisza of $85 million, and Deepwater of $79 million ($537 million, or $0.69 per share, $130 million, or $0.17 per share, $69 million, or $0.09 per share, and $51 million, or $0.07 per share, net of income tax, respectively) and goodwill impairment at Deepwater of $18 million (or $0.02 per share, with no income tax impact). (7) Amount includes: Goodwill impairments at Kilroot of $118 million, or $0.18 per share, and in the Ukraine of $4 million, or $0.01 per share; write off of development project costs in Latin America and Asia of $19 million ($11 million net of noncontrolling interests, or $0.01 per share) and an impairment of $10 million, or $0.01 per share, of the Companys investment in a company developing blue gas (coal to gas) technology. There was no income tax impact associated with any of these transactions. 121 Table of Contents (8) Amount includes: Impairment charges primarily associated with development projects in North America of $75 million ($34 million net of noncontrolling interests and income tax, or $0.06 per share); Uruguaiana asset write down of $36 million ($17 million net of noncontrolling interest, or $0.02 per share); South Africa peaker development cost write off of $31 million ($28 million net of income tax, or $0.04 per share) and a nontaxable impairment of the Companys investment in blue gas (coal to gas) technology of $10 million, or $0.01 per share. Impairment losses are net of an income tax benefit of $0.02 per share in 2008. (9) Amount includes loss on retirement of debt at the Parent Company of $15 million, at Andres of $10 million, and at Itabo of $8 million ($10 million, or $0.01 per share, net of income tax at the Parent Company, $0.01 per share at Andres, and $4 million, or $0.01 per share, net of noncontrolling interest at Itabo). (10) Amount includes: $55 million ($34 million net of income tax, or $0.05 per share) loss on the retirement of Parent Company debt; $131 million, or $0.19 per share, which represented the tax impact on the repatriation of a portion of the Kazakhstan sale proceeds that were used to fund the early retirement of Parent Company debt; and $14 million ($9 million net of income tax, or $0.01 per share) of debt refinancing at IPALCO. Debt retirement (gains) losses are net of an income tax benefit of $0.04 per share in 2008. Managements Priorities Management continues to focus on the following priorities: Execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy including funds received in 2010 from asset and equity sales: investing in value accretive projects; delevering to increase financial flexibility, reduce risk and to create future borrowing capacity; and executing its stock repurchase program; from July through December 2010 we have repurchased a total of $99 million, or approximately 8.4 million shares of AES common stock, at an average price per share of $11.86, including commissions. Improvement of operations in the existing portfolio; Achieve cost savings through the alignment of overhead costs with business requirements, systems automation and optimal allocation of business development spending; Strategic portfolio management of existing projects including restructuring and potential sales of certain North American generation subsidiaries; Completion of an approximately 1,300 MW active construction program on time and within budget; Achieving commercial operation at Maritza in Bulgaria. At the end of 2010, the Company experienced certain commissioning delays, as further described in Key Trends and Uncertainties Development below; and 122 Table of Contents Integration of new projects. During 2010, the following projects were acquired or commenced commercial operations: Project Location Fuel GrossMW AES Equity Interest(Percent, Rounded) Ballylumford United Kingdom Gas 1,246 100 % JHRH(1) China Hydro 379 35 % Nueva Ventanas Chile Coal 272 71 % St. Nikola Bulgaria Wind 156 89 % Guacolda 4(2) Chile Coal 152 35 % Dong Qi(3) China Wind 49 49 % Huanghua II(3) China Wind 49 49 % St. Patrick France Wind 35 100 % North Rhins Scotland Wind 22 100 % Kepezkaya Turkey Hydro 28 51 % Damlapinar(4) Turkey Hydro 16 51 % (1) Jianghe Rural Electrification Development Co.

Acquisition of 35% ownership was completed in June 2010 and the transfer of the remaining 14% ownership, which is subject to approval by the Chinese government, is expected to be completed in May 2011. (2) Guacolda is an equity method investment indirectly held by AES through Gener. The AES equity interest reflects the 29% noncontrolling interests in Gener. (3) Joint venture with Guohua Energy Investment Co. Ltd. (4) Joint Venture with I.C. Energy. Key Trends and Uncertainties Our operations continue to face many risks as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Some of these challenges are also described above in Key Drivers of Results in 2010. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. Development. During the past year, the Company has successfully acquired and completed construction of a number of projects, totaling approximately 2,404 MW, including the acquisition of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom and completion of construction of a number of projects in Europe, Chile and China. However, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties of this Form 10 K, our development projects are subject to uncertainties. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not yet begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, we believe that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this time frame. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results or financial position. Global Economic Conditions. During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Although the economic conditions in several of these countries have improved in recent months, our businesses could be impacted in the event these recent trends do not continue. 123 Table of Contents Our business or results of operations could be impacted if our subsidiaries are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all, are unable to raise funds through the sale of assets or are otherwise unable to finance or refinance their activities. The Company could also be adversely affected if capital market disruptions result in increased borrowing costs (including with respect to interest payments on the Companys or our subsidiaries variable rate debt) or if commodity prices affect the profitability of our plants or their ability to continue operations. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if general economic or political conditions in the markets where our subsidiaries operate deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the availability and or an increase in the cost of capital, or if the value of our assets remain depressed or decline further. Any of the foregoing events or a combination thereof could have a material impact on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, financial covenants, and or its credit rating. Our subsidiaries are subject to credit risk, which includes risk related to the ability of counterparties (such as parties to our PPAs, fuel supply agreements, hedging agreements and other contractual arrangements) to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price or to satisfy their financial or other contractual obligations. The Company has not suffered any material effects related to its counterparties during 2010. However, if macroeconomic conditions impact our counterparties, they may be unable to meet their commitments which could result in the loss of favorable contractual positions, which could have a material impact on our business. In addition, during the past year, certain European countries have faced a sovereign debt crisis and it is possible that other nations could be affected. This crisis has resulted in an increased risk of default by governments and the implementation of austerity measures in countries. If the crisis continues, worsens, or spreads, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company. Our businesses may be impacted if they are unable to access the capital markets, face increased taxes or labor costs, or if governments fail to fulfill their obligations to us or adopt austerity measures which adversely impact our projects. In addition, as noted in the Risk Factor entitled, Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges, our renewables businesses are dependent on favorable regulatory incentives, including subsidies, which are provided by sovereign governments. If these subsidies or other incentives are reduced or repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, in whole or in part, this could impact the ability of the affected businesses to continue to grow their operations. For example, the Spanish government recently issued a decree which limits the feed in tariff and number of photovoltaic hours eligible for the tariff, which could adversely impact AES Solar in Spain. For further information on the decree see Item 1. Regulatory Spain of this Form 10 K. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries. For further information on the importance of long term contracts and our counterparty credit risk, see the Risk Factor from this Form 10 K titled, We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. As a result of any of the foregoing events, we may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. The Companys investment in AES Solar, whose primary operations are in Europe, at December 31, 2010 was $312 million. For a discussion of the risks associated with commodity prices, see We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. It is also possible that commodity or power price volatility could continue to impact our financial results. As noted in Key Drivers of Results in 2010, and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk of this Form 10 K, the Companys North American businesses continue to face pressure as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place, but purchase 124 Table of Contents fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. If these conditions continue or worsen, these businesses may need to restructure their obligations or seek additional funding (including from the Parent) or face the possibility that they may be unable to meet their obligations and continue operations. Presently, Eastern Energy, Deepwater and Thames are seeking to restructure their financial obligations and or place certain of their plants in protective layup status to mitigate operating risks caused by high fuel costs and other competitive pressures. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. The Company presently manages its commodity risk with hedging activities to mitigate earnings volatility. However, at present in North America, dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present an opportunity to engage in additional hedging activity for 2011. As a result, there are hedging arrangements in place for only a relatively small portion of 2011. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. Specifically, the operating results of the Companys Eastern Energy generation business in New York could be adversely impacted by continued higher coal prices relative to electricity prices if hedging continues to be uneconomic. If global economic conditions worsen, it could also affect the rates we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our rates based on prevailing market conditions as PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual rate or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. Impairments. Long lived assets. The global economic conditions and other adverse factors discussed above heighten the risk of a significant asset impairment. Examples of conditions that could be indicative of impairment which would require us to evaluate the recovery of a long lived asset or asset group include: current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset group; a significant adverse change in legal factors, including changes in environmental or other regulations or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used or in its physical condition. As further described in Item 1. Regulatory Matters United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR) had the right to require the termination of the long term PPAs under which Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom, supplies electricity to NIE Energy as early as 2010. One of the conditions to the early termination was 180 days notice, which was provided to Kilroot on April 30, 2010. At March 31, 2010, management evaluated Kilroots long lived assets for potential impairment assuming the early termination of the PPA and concluded that no impairment existed at that time. On October 28, 2010, Kilroot received final notice from NIAUR directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the PPA effective November 1, 2010. Kilroot may not be able to replace the contract on competitive terms and, upon cancellation of the PPA effective November 1, 2010, became a merchant plant. It will operate under the gross mandatory pool of the SEM in Northern Ireland. There have been no additional impairment indicators since March 31, 2010. AES Eastern Energy (AEE) operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. 125 Table of Contents The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated an impairment evaluation of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW petroleum coke (pet coke) fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and a recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 126 Table of Contents 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time, since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and what form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations. This was considered as an impairment indicator for the long lived asset groups. The recoverability test of the long lived asset groups indicated that the carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group exceeded its fair value by $200 million which was recognized as an impairment expense. The carrying amounts of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach long lived asset groups were determined to be recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis at September 30, 2010 and no impairment was necessary. During the third quarter of 2010, we also recognized impairment on the long lived assets at our Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. Tisza II operates under an annual contract with an off taker. In the third quarter of 2010, when Tisza II began the negotiation of its 2011 contract, future undiscounted cash flows of the plant were no longer expected to recover the long lived assets groups carrying amount due to prevailing market rates, higher generation costs and lower demand expectations. Accordingly, the Company measured the fair value of the long lived asset group and recorded an impairment expense of $85 million, representing the excess of carrying amount over the fair value at September 30, 2010. Goodwill. The Company seeks business acquisitions as one of its growth strategies. We have achieved significant growth in the past as a result of several business acquisitions, which also resulted in the recognition of goodwill. As noted in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, there is always a risk that Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. The benefits of goodwill are typically realized through the future operating results of an acquired business. Management believes that the recoverability of goodwill is positively correlated with the economic environments in which our acquired businesses operate and a severe economic downturn could negatively impact the recoverability of goodwill. Also, the evolving environmental regulations, including GHG regulations, around the globe continue to increase the operating costs of our generation businesses. In extreme situations, the environmental regulations could even make a once profitable business uneconomical. In addition, most of our generation businesses have a finite life and as the acquired businesses reach the end of their finite lives, the carrying amount of goodwill is gradually recovered through their periodic operating results. The accounting guidance, however, prohibits the systematic amortization of goodwill and rather requires an annual impairment evaluation. Thus, as some of our acquired businesses approach the end of their finite lives, they may incur goodwill impairment charges even if there are no discrete adverse changes in the economic environment. As noted in Long lived assets above, adverse market conditions at Deepwater were also considered an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. Accordingly, in the second and third quarters of 2010, interim 127 Table of Contents goodwill impairment evaluations were performed at the Deepwater reporting unit level. The reporting unit passed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation in the second quarter and no impairment was recognized. In the third quarter, however, the reporting unit failed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation. Upon measurement of impairment loss in Step 2, the entire $18 million goodwill balance was considered impaired and recognized as goodwill impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation and did not have any reporting units that were considered at risk. A reporting unit is considered at risk when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. While there were no potential impairment indicators that could result in the recognition of goodwill impairment for any of these reporting units, it is possible we may incur goodwill impairment on these reporting units in future years if any of the following events occur: a significant adverse change in business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a sale of assets at less than carrying amount, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, an acquisition not performing as expected, changing environmental regulations that significantly increase the cost of doing business, or a business reaches the end of its finite life. The likelihood of the occurrence of these events may increase because of the challenging global macroeconomic conditions. Regulatory Environment. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter and mercury. For a description of material regulations faced by the Company, see Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies and Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows set forth in this Form 10 K. Recent Events Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company continued to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program announced on July 7, 2010. The Company has repurchased 1,026,610 shares at a cost of $13 million in 2011, bringing the cumulative total through February 22, 2010 to 9,409,435 shares at a total cost of $112 million (average price of $11.92 per share including commissions). As of February 25, 2011, $388 million of the $500 million authorized remained available under the stock repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 14 Equity. On February 1, 2011, AES Thames, LLC (Thames), our 208 MW coal fired plant in Connecticut, filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy is due, in part, to the increased cost of energy production. The bankruptcy protection is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or the results of operations. 128 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, Results of operations 2010 2009 2008 $ change2010 vs. 2009 $ change2009 vs. 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: Latin America Generation $ 4,281 $ 3,651 $ 4,468 $ 630 $ (817 ) Latin America Utilities 7,222 6,092 5,907 1,130 185 North America Generation 1,972 1,940 2,234 32 (294 ) North America Utilities 1,145 1,068 1,079 77 (11 ) Europe Generation 1,362 820 1,143 542 (323 ) Asia Generation 618 375 345 243 30 Corporate and Other(1) 1,066 870 1,012 196 (142 ) Eliminations(2) (1,019 ) (862 ) (991 ) (157 ) 129 Total Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 $ 2,693 $ (1,243 ) Gross Margin: Latin America Generation $ 1,497 $ 1,357 $ 1,398 $ 140 $ (41 ) Latin America Utilities 1,072 918 886 154 32 North America Generation 435 477 660 (42 ) (183 ) North America Utilities 249 239 261 10 (22 ) Europe Generation 268 212 273 56 (61 ) Asia Generation 240 93 (10 ) 147 103 Corporate and Other(3) 186 117 62 69 55 Eliminations(4) 17 20 38 (3 ) (18 ) General and administrative expenses (392 ) (339 ) (368 ) (53 ) 29 Interest expense (1,526 ) (1,485 ) (1,770 ) (41 ) 285 Interest income 411 348 519 63 (171 ) Other expense (239 ) (111 ) (161 ) (128 ) 50 Other income 108 465 375 (357 ) 90 Gain on sale of investments 131 909 (131 ) (778 ) Loss on sale of subsidiary stock (31 ) 31 Goodwill impairment (21 ) (122 ) 101 (122 ) Asset impairment expense (1,221 ) (25 ) (175 ) (1,196 ) 150 Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position (33 ) 33 (184 ) (66 ) 217 Other non operating expense (7 ) (12 ) (15 ) 5 3 Income tax expense (307 ) (599 ) (771 ) 292 172 Net equity in earnings of affiliates 183 92 33 91 59 Income from continuing operations 920 1,809 1,929 (889 ) (120 ) Income from operations of discontinued businesses 75 96 97 (21 ) (1 ) Gain (loss) from disposal of discontinued businesses 64 (150 ) 6 214 (156 ) Net income 1,059 1,755 2,032 (696 ) (277 ) Noncontrolling interests: Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,006 ) (1,099 ) (759 ) 93 (340 ) (Income) loss from discontinuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (44 ) 2 (39 ) (46 ) 41 Net income attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 $ (649 ) $ (576 ) Per Share Data: Basic income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.75 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.69 ) Diluted income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.67 ) (1) Corporate and Other includes revenue from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, Wind Generation and other renewables initiatives.

These increases were partially offset by: lower volume sold at Uruguaiana of $53 million as a result of renegotiation of its power sales agreements; lower volume due to unfavorable hydrology in Colombia and Argentina of $41 million; lower contract prices at Gener of $32 million; and lower contract prices on PPAs indexed to international coal prices in the Dominican Republic of $22 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $106 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $34 million, or 3%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher spot prices in Argentina of $69 million; higher volume and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic of $55 million; higher contract prices of $33 million in Colombia; the positive impact of $28 million resulting from the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana, as mentioned above; and higher volume of $23 million in Panama. These increases were partially offset by: higher fuel and purchased energy prices at Gener of $48 million; the net effect of lower PPA prices and higher fuel costs in the Dominican Republic of $38 million; 130 Table of Contents the impact of a reversal of bad debt expense during the first quarter of 2009 of $36 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of one of its power sales agreements; and higher fixed costs of $30 million at Gener primarily due to higher employee costs, increased maintenance expenses and costs incurred due to construction delays at Campiche. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 17% while gross margin increased 10%, primarily due to higher spot purchases and fuel prices at Gener and the reversal of bad debt expense as a result of the renegotiation of one of the power sales agreements at Uruguaiana in the first quarter of 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $181 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $636 million, or 14%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower spot and contract prices of $295 million at Gener; lower volume of $227 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold; and lower energy prices and volume of $174 million in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: and increase of $100 million due to fewer outages at Gener and in Argentina in 2009; and higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $94 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $53 million, or 4%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;; fewer outages of $60 million at Gener and in Argentina; lower diesel consumption, partially offset by higher energy purchases and higher gas consumption, at Gener of $47 million; lower volume of energy purchased at Uruguaiana of $44 million as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements; and the favorable impact of $28 million of a decrease in bad debt expense at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of lower energy prices of $75 million in the Dominican Republic; lower volume and energy prices of $66 million in Argentina; higher purchased energy prices of $48 million at Uruguaiana; and lower spot sales of $48 million at Panama. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 18% while gross margin decreased 3%, primarily due to reduced energy purchases, fewer outages and lower bad debt expense. 131 Table of Contents Latin America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in Latin America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Latin America Utilities Revenue $ 7,222 $ 6,092 $ 5,907 19 % 3 % Gross Margin $ 1,072 $ 918 $ 886 17 % 4 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $697 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2010 increased $433 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $316 million, primarily in Brazil, due to increased market demand; and higher tariffs of $114 million primarily related to the July 2009 tariff reset in Brazil partially offset by the unfavorable impact on rates at Eletropaulo in Brazil of a cumulative adjustment to regulatory liabilities and higher energy prices across our Latin America utility businesses associated with energy purchases passed through to customers of $97 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $107 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $47 million, or 5%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $163 million, primarily in Brazil, due to the increased market demand; and lower contingencies of $142 million in Eletropaulo primarily related to labor contingencies which included a one time reversal, reflecting an agreement with Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o CESP, the pension plan administrator, of $51 million associated with claims for past benefit obligations which will now be accounted for as a component of the pension plan. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $238 million primarily due to the recovery in 2009 of a municipality receivable previously written off in Brazil and higher salaries and other employee related costs, provisions for commercial losses, regulatory penalties and maintenance costs; and $28 million related to the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $442 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2009 increased $627 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $560 million reflecting the recovery of energy purchases of $453 million that were passed through to customers at our utilities in Brazil and El Salvador; and higher volume in Brazil of $62 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $62 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2009 increased $94 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $107 million in El Salvador and Brazil; a $64 million recovery of a municipality receivable previously written off; 132 Table of Contents a non recurring PIS/COFINS fine in 2008 of $33 million; and higher volume of $32 million across the region. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of higher fixed costs of $120 million mainly related to pension expense, labor contingencies and maintenance costs in Brazil. North America Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Generation Revenue $ 1,972 $ 1,940 $ 2,234 2 % 13 % Gross Margin $ 435 $ 477 $ 660 9 % 28 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $19 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $13 million, or 1%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased rates, volume and an availability bonus at TEG/TEP in Mexico of $41 million; higher volume, primarily due to fewer outages and higher rates, of $22 million at Merida in Mexico; higher volume of $19 million at Warrior Run in Maryland due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. These increases were partially offset by: a net decrease of $50 million in New York due to lower rates partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a net decrease of $18 million at Deepwater in Texas primarily due to lower volume; and a net decrease of $14 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3 million, generation gross margin for 2010 decreased $45 million, or 9%, from 2009 primarily due to: a net decrease of $94 million in New York due to lower rates and higher coal prices partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a decrease of $16 million at Deepwater due to lower volume and rates; a net decrease of $11 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage; a decrease of $9 million in Hawaii due to an unfavorable impact of mark to market derivatives; and a decrease of $7 million in Puerto Rico due to higher fixed costs. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase of $39 million in New York primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of lower contract and maintenance costs, and other employee related costs; 133 Table of Contents a net increase of $26 million at TEG/TEP due to a current year availability bonus and fewer outages partially offset by higher fuel prices; higher volume of $14 million at Warrior Run due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 2% while gross margin decreased 9%, primarily due to the change in rates in New York having a greater impact on gross margin than revenue. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $44 million, primarily in Mexico, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $250 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $107 million in New York due to a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a decrease of $80 million due to a reduction in natural gas prices at Merida; increased outages of $22 million, $21 million and $17 million at Warrior Run, TEG/TEP and New York, respectively; lower rates of $20 million at Deepwater; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives in New York of $11 million; and the unfavorable impact in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $9 million, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $174 million, or 26%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $72 million in New York driven by a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a $29 million unfavorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments on coal supply contracts in Hawaii as a result of a gain of $22 million in 2008 compared to a loss of $7 million in 2009; an increase in outages of $22 million and $6 million at Warrior Run and in New York, respectively; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives of $11 million and higher emission allowance purchases of $13 million in New York; and the unfavorable impact of $9 million in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 13% while gross margin decreased 28%, primarily due to the increase in coal prices in New York and the unfavorable impact of derivatives in 2009 in Hawaii that had no corresponding impact on revenue. 134 Table of Contents North America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Utilities Revenue $ 1,145 $ 1,068 $ 1,079 7 % 1 % Gross Margin $ 249 $ 239 $ 261 4 % 8 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Utilities revenue for 2010 increased $77 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail demand of $64 million as a result of warmer weather and higher fuel adjustment charges; and increased wholesale revenue of $11 million primarily due to higher prices. Utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $10 million, or 4%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail margin of $20 million due to increased demand; lower pension expense of $12 million; and lower emission allowance expense of $5 million. These increases were partially offset by: increased maintenance expenses of $16 million due to the timing of major generating unit overhauls; and increased fixed costs of $14 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 7% while gross margin increased 4%, primarily due to increased fuel and maintenance costs. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Utilities revenue for 2009 decreased $11 million, or 1%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower retail volume of $31 million due primarily to milder weather and the economic recession; and decreased wholesale revenue of $7 million driven by lower market prices. These decreases were partially offset by: $32 million of voluntary credits IPL provided to retail customers in 2008. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters North America of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these credits. Utilities gross margin for 2009 decreased $22 million, or 8%, from 2008 primarily due to: decreased wholesale margin of $16 million due to unfavorable prices; and increased pension expense of $25 million largely due to the decline in market value of IPLs pension assets during 2008. 135 Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by: increased retail margin of $15 million, primarily due to the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, partially offset by lower retail sales volumes in 2009; and decreased property tax expense of $5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 1% while gross margin decreased 8%, primarily due to the $25 million increase in pension expense and the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, both of which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. Europe Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Europe for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Europe Generation Revenue $ 1,362 $ 820 $ 1,143 66 % 28 % Gross Margin $ 268 $ 212 $ 273 26 % 22 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $41 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $583 million, or 71%, from 2009 primarily due to: $409 million from the adoption of new accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) which resulted in the consolidation of Cartagena in Spain, a generation business previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting; $117 million from the operations of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom, which was acquired in August 2010; $16 million from a full year of combined cycle operations at our Amman East plant in Jordan, which was single cycle until August 2009; higher tariffs of $16 million at Altai in Kazakhstan; higher volume of $15 million at Kilroot in the United Kingdom largely driven by coal pass through and increased demand, partially offset by lower capacity revenue due to the termination of the long term PPA and related supplementary agreements. These increases were partially offset by: lower volume and sales of emissions allowances in Hungary of $16 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $1 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $57 million, or 27%, from 2009 primarily due to: $62 million from the consolidation of Cartagena as discussed above; higher tariffs and lower fixed costs at Altai of $29 million; and $13 million from the operations of Ballylumford since its acquisition. 136 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: lower gross margin of $28 million primarily from the termination of the long term PPA at Kilroot; and lower gross margin of $20 million in Hungary primarily attributable to higher fuel costs that could not be passed through and lower sales of emission allowances. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 66% while gross margin increased 26%, primarily due to the consolidation of Cartagena and acquisition of Ballylumford that have a larger positive impact on revenue than gross margin, and the positive impact of higher energy revenue at Kilroot, which as a pass through had no corresponding impact on gross margin. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $146 million, driven mainly by Kilroot, Hungary and Kazakhstan, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $177 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower revenue of $101 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower volume of $81 million in Hungary due to the combined impact of the cancellation of one of our PPAs and reduced demand; and lower volume of $67 million at Kilroot, a coal fired plant, mainly driven by lower dispatch due to favorable gas prices compared to coal. These decreases were partially offset by: the benefit of new business of $50 million at Amman East, which commenced single cycle operations in July 2008; and higher rates of $15 million in Kazakhstan. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $35 million, driven mainly by Kilroot and Kazakhstan, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $26 million, or 10%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower gross margin of $41 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower demand of $12 million in Hungary; and an overall increase of $22 million in fixed costs across the region. These decreases were partially offset by: higher capacity revenue at Kilroot; higher energy prices in Kazakhstan; and the benefit of new business at Amman East. Asia Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Asia for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Asia Generation Revenue $ 618 $ 375 $ 345 65 % 9 % Gross Margin $ 240 $ 93 $ (10 ) 158 % 1030 % 137 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $28 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $215 million, or 57%, from 2009 primarily due to: favorable generation rates and volume of $210 million at Masinloc in the Philippines as a result of increased market demand and improved plant availability subsequent to the completion of its overhaul at the beginning of 2010; and higher demand from both new and existing contract and spot customers as a result of lower supply shortages in the Philippines power market due to a strong energy growth rate. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $13 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $134 million, or 144%, from 2009 primarily due to a combination of higher availability attributable to improved plant operations, higher market demand and favorable spot prices at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 65% while gross margin increased 158%, primarily due to the positive influence on gross margin due to favorable spot rates and operational efficiencies resulting from the Masinloc plant overhauls in late 2009 and early 2010, which led to higher availability and allowed for more efficient operations that have materially improved the operating results for 2010 as compared to 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $23 million, primarily in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, generation revenue for 2009 increased $53 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: the benefit of $46 million of our new business Masinloc, which was acquired in April 2008; increased revenue of $70 million in 2009 at Masinloc due to improved rates and volume as a result of improved availability and new customer contracts; and $18 million from a one time favorable energy sales settlement at Masinloc. These increases were partially offset by: the decrease in revenue of $71 million at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka primarily due to a decline in fuel costs which are largely passed through to the customer and higher outages in 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by higher capacity revenue. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $6 million, primarily in the Philippines, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $109 million, or 1,090%, from 2008 primarily due to: the impact of our new business at Masinloc of $23 million; a $91 million increase at Masinloc due to higher contract sales, where margins are more favorable than spot sales, lower fuel prices, improved availability and the favorable energy sales settlement described above; and higher capacity revenue at Kelanitissa of $10 million. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $20 million at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue increased 9% while gross margin increased 1,030%, primarily due to higher contract margins at Masinloc as a result of improved operations, availability and lower fuel prices, as well as the larger relative impact on gross margin from the one time favorable energy sales settlement described above. 138 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Corporate and other includes the net operating results from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, AES Wind Generation and renewables projects which are immaterial for the purposes of separate segment disclosure. The following table excludes inter segment activity and summarizes revenue and gross margin for Corporate and Other entities for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Revenue Europe Utilities $ 356 $ 286 $ 403 24 % 29 % Africa Utilities 422 370 379 14 % 2 % Africa Generation 61 65 65 6 % 0 % Wind Generation 202 133 128 52 % 4 % Corp/Other 25 16 37 56 % 57 % Total Corporate and Other $ 1,066 $ 870 $ 1,012 23 % 14 % Gross Margin Europe Utilities $ 21 $ 16 $ 34 31 % 53 % Africa Utilities 65 71 30 8 % 137 % Africa Generation 54 41 28 32 % 46 % Wind Generation 44 11 19 300 % 42 % Corp/Other 2 (22 ) (49 ) 109 % 55 % Total Corporate and Other $ 186 $ 117 $ 62 59 % 89 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $30 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other revenue increased $226 million for 2010, or 26% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: higher volume at our utility businesses in Ukraine driven by an overall increase in market demand; higher volume and utility tariffs at Sonel in Cameroon driven by an increase in market demand; and incremental revenue from new wind generation projects that commenced operations during the year and an overall volume increase across our wind businesses. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $8 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $77 million for 2010, or 66% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: an increase in gross margin from our new wind generation projects and higher volume, as discussed above; and an increase in volume at Dibamba, our generation business, in Cameroon. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs at Sonel. 139 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $162 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other revenue increased $20 million for 2009, or 2%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: higher tariffs in Ukraine of $27 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $12 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $67 million for 2009, or 108%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: a decrease in fixed costs across the Africa region. The increase was partially offset by: higher fuel consumption attributable to lower hydrology at Sonel. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense includes those expenses related to corporate and region staff functions and or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems, and development costs. General and administrative expenses increased $53 million, or 16%, to $392 million in 2010 from 2009. The increase is primarily related to business development costs associated with increased development efforts, primarily in Europe, Turkey and India. General and administrative expenses decreased $29 million, or 8%, to $339 million in 2009 from 2008. The decrease is primarily related to 2008 professional fees associated with remediation efforts and a reduction in business development costs. The favorable variance is partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the worldwide implementation of SAP. Interest expense Interest expense increased $41 million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to interest expense at Cartagena which is now a consolidated entity, higher interest rates at Tiet&ecirc;, increased debt principal at Eletropaulo and interest being expensed related to St. Nikola, our wind project in Bulgaria, due to commencement of operations in 2010. These increases were partially offset by reduced debt principal at the Parent Company. Interest expense decreased $285 million, or 16%, to $1.5 billion in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates globally due to economic conditions and inflationary adjustments to the market price index in Brazil. In addition, interest expense decreased as a result of favorable foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil and lower interest expenses associated with decreased debt balances at Eletropaulo. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense at Masinloc in the Philippines which was acquired in April 2008, and interest expense at Infovias in Brazil where a fee on a non exercised credit line was written off. Interest income Interest income increased $63 million, or 18%, to $411 million in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to a higher average balance in short term investments at Eletropaulo and the favorable impact of 140 Table of Contents foreign currency translation in Brazil as well as the settlement of a dispute related to inflation adjustments for energy sales at Tiet&ecirc;. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest income from a loan to a wind development project in Brazil which was repaid in June 2010. Interest income decreased $171 million, or 33%, to $348 million in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances in Brazil, unfavorable foreign currency translation in Brazil, the impact of decreased interest rates and inflationary adjustments on accounts receivable in 2008 at Gener in Chile and a decreased cash balance at the Parent Company. Other income Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Gain on extinguishment of tax and other liabilities $ 65 $ 168 $ 199 Tax credit settlement 129 Performance incentive fee 80 Insurance proceeds 40 Gain on sale of assets 12 14 34 Other 31 74 102 Total other income $ 108 $ 465 $ 375 Other income of $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to the extinguishment of a swap liability owed by two of our Brazilian subsidiaries, resulting in the recognition of a $62 million gain. The net impact to the Company after taxes and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Other income also included a gain on sale of assets at Eletropaulo. Other income of $465 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $165 million from the reduction in interest and penalties associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the REFIS program and a $129 million gain related to a favorable court decision enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. The net impact to the Company after income taxes and noncontrolling interests for these items was $44 million. In addition, the Company recognized income in 2009 of $80 million from a performance incentive bonus for management services provided to Ekibastuz and Maikuben in 2008. The management agreement was related to the sale of these businesses in Kazakhstan in May 2008; see further discussion of this transaction in Note 22 Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Other income of $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included gains on the extinguishment of a gross receipts tax liability and a legal contingency at Eletropaulo of $117 million and $75 million, respectively, $32 million of cash proceeds related to a favorable legal settlement at Southland in California, $29 million of insurance recoveries for damaged turbines at Uruguaiana, $23 million of gains associated with a sale of land at Eletropaulo and sales of turbines at Itabo, and compensation of $18 million for the impairment associated with the settlement agreement to shut down Hefei. 141 Table of Contents Other expense Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Loss on sale and disposal of assets $ 84 $ 42 $ 34 Gener gas settlement 72 Loss on extinguishment of debt 37 70 AES Wind transaction costs 22 Other 24 69 57 Total other expense $ 239 $ 111 $ 161 Other expense of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $72 million for a settlement agreement of gas transportation contracts at Gener. There were also previously capitalized transaction costs of $22 million that were incurred in connection with the preparation for the sale of a noncontrolling interest in our Wind Generation business which were written off upon the expiration of the letter of intent in June 2010. In addition, there were losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo, Panama, and Gener, an $18 million loss on debt extinguishment at Andres and Itabo and a $15 million loss at the Parent Company from the retirement of senior notes. Other expense of $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $13 million loss recognized when three of our businesses in the Dominican Republic received $110 million par value bonds issued by the Dominican Republic government to settle existing accounts receivable for the same amount from the government owned distribution companies. The loss represented an adjustment to reflect the fair value of the bonds on the date received. Other expense also included losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo and Andres and contingencies at our businesses in Kazakhstan and Alicura in Argentina. Other expense of $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $69 million of losses on the retirement of debt at the Parent Company in connection with the refinancing in June 2008 and IPALCO associated with a $375 million refinancing in April 2008 and losses on disposal of assets primarily at Eletropaulo. Goodwill Impairment In 2010, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2010, Deepwater, our pet coke fired merchant generation facility in Texas, determined that there was an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. This determination was primarily based on managements decision not to operate the plant for more than 30 days in the third quarter of 2010, current operating and cash flow losses, and forecasted operating and cash flow losses for the remainder of 2010 through 2014 as a result of declining trends in energy pricing curves and increasing pet coke prices. As a result, Deepwater recognized a goodwill impairment of $18 million. Deepwater is reported in the North America Generation segment. In 2009, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $122 million. This was a result of impairment at certain of our businesses in the United Kingdom and Ukraine as a result of the Companys annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of October 1. The most significant goodwill impairment was at Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom. Factors contributing to the recognition of impairment included: reduced profit expectations based on latest estimates of future commodity prices and reduced expectations on the recovery of cash flows on the existing plant following the Companys decision to forgo capital expenditures to meet emission allowance requirements taking effect in 2024. The fair value of the Companys reporting units are inherently sensitive to the assumptions underlying the estimates of fair value. Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Fair Value, Goodwill and Intangibles in Item 8 of this Form 10 K provides a 142 Table of Contents more detailed discussion of those assumptions. As discussed in Key Trends and Uncertainties, in the future, the fair values of the Companys reporting units might decline as a result of adverse changes in their operating environments or the businesses reaching the end of their finite lives, which could require the Company to record additional goodwill impairment charges. The Company did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2008. Asset Impairment Expense As discussed in Note 19 Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, asset impairment expense for the year 2010 was $1,221 million and consisted primarily of the following: Eastern Energy AEE operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated a recoverability test of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Southland In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and the exact form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process 143 Table of Contents through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations and the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. The Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment. The asset group was determined to be at the individual plant level and based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined that the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the Huntington Beach asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying value of the Huntington Beach plant of $288 million exceeded the fair value of $88 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $200 million. The undiscounted cash flows of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach generation facilities exceeded their respective carrying values and resulted in no impairment. Huntington Beach is reported in the North America Generation reportable segment. Tisza II During the third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into annual negotiations with the offtaker of its Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. As a result of these preliminary negotiations, as well as the further deterioration of the economic environment in Hungary, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. Thus, the Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and determined that based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount of the Tisza II asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The carrying value of the Tisza II asset group of $160 million exceeded the fair value of $75 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $85 million. Tisza II is reported in the Europe Generation reportable segment. Deepwater In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW pet coke fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, 144 Table of Contents all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Asset impairment expense for the year 2009 was $25 million. In 2009, the Company recognized a pre tax long lived asset impairment charge of $11 million related to the Companys Piabanha hydro project in Brazil. The Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows and abandoned the project. Asset impairment expense for the year 2008 was $175 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, the Company reviewed and prioritized projects in the development pipeline. From this review, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows for certain projects. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $75 million ($34 million, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes) related to two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non power development project at one of our facilities in North America. During 2008, the Company recognized additional impairment charges of $36 million related to long lived assets at Uruguaiana. The impairment was triggered by a combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy in 2007 that continued in 2008. Following an initial impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, further charges were incurred in 2008 due to fixed asset purchase agreements in place. During the first half of 2008, the Company withdrew from projects in South Africa and Israel which resulted in impairment charges of $36 million. The Company also recognized an impairment of $18 million related to the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China. Gain on sale of investments There was no gain on sale of investments in 2010. Gain on sale of investments of $131 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $98 million recognized in May 2009 related to the termination of the management agreement between the Company and Kazakhmys PLC for Ekibastuz and Maikuben, a gain of $14 million from the sale of the remaining assets associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China and $13 million from the reversal of a contingent liability related to the Kazakhstan sale in 2008. Gain on sale of investments of $909 million in 2008 consisted primarily of the sale in May 2008 of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Ekibastuz and Maikuben for a net gain of $905 million. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock There was no loss on sale of subsidiary stock in 2010 or 2009. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock of $31 million in 2008 was the result of sales of AES Gener shares made by our wholly owned subsidiary Cachagua. In November 2008, Cachagua sold 9.6% of its ownership in Gener to a third party reducing its ownership in Gener to 70.6%. 145 Table of Contents Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Companys net monetary position from foreign currency transaction activities: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) AES Corporation $ (50 ) $ 13 $ 38 Chile 8 65 (96 ) Philippines 8 15 (57 ) Brazil (6 ) (9 ) (44 ) Argentina 12 (10 ) (28 ) Kazakhstan 1 (24 ) 14 Colombia (4 ) (11 ) 5 Other (2 ) (6 ) (16 ) Total(1) $ (33 ) $ 33 $ (184 ) (1) Includes (losses) gains of $(10) million, $(39) million and $10 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These losses consisted primarily of losses at The AES Corporation partially offset by gains in Argentina. Losses of $50 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the devaluation of notes receivable resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound, and losses on foreign exchange swaps and options, partially offset by gains on cash balances and debt denominated in British Pounds. Gains of $12 million in Argentina were primarily due to a gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso by 5%, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These gains consisted primarily of gains in Chile, the Philippines and at The AES Corporation partially offset by losses in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. Gains of $65 million in Chile were primarily due to the appreciation of the Chilean Peso of 20% resulting in gains at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Peso, mainly cash and accounts receivables. This gain was partially offset by $14 million in losses on foreign currency derivatives. Gains of $15 million in the Philippines were primarily due to the appreciation of the Philippine Peso of 3%, resulting in gains at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on the remeasurement of U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $13 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the settlement of the senior unsecured credit facility and the revaluation of notes receivable denominated in the Euro, partially offset by losses on debt denominated in British Pounds. Losses of $24 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar and $12 million of foreign currency transaction losses on debt and other liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Kazakh Tenge. 146 Table of Contents Losses of $11 million in Colombia were primarily due to the appreciation of the Colombian Peso of 9%, resulting in losses at Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its Colombian Peso denominated debt and losses on foreign currency derivatives. Losses of $10 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2009, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt, partially offset by derivative gains. Losses of $9 million in Brazil were primarily due to energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar, resulting in foreign currency transaction losses of $18 million, partially offset by gains of $9 million due to the appreciation in 2009 of the Brazilian Real of 25%, resulting in gains at Sul and Uruguaiana associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These losses consisted primarily of losses in Chile, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina partially offset by gains at The AES Corporation and in Kazakhstan. Losses of $96 million in Chile were primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso of 28% in 2008, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable and value added tax (VAT) receivables. Losses of $57 million in the Philippines were primarily due to remeasurement losses at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on U.S. Dollar denominated debt resulting from depreciation of the Philippine Peso of 14% in 2008. Losses of $44 million in Brazil were primarily due to the realization of deferred exchange variance on past energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar. Losses of $28 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2008, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $38 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to debt denominated in British Pounds and gains on foreign exchange derivatives, partially offset by losses on notes receivable denominated in the Euro. Gains of $14 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction gains of $16 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar, offset by $5 million of foreign currency transaction losses on external and intercompany debt denominated in other than the Kazakh Tenge functional currency. Income taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $292 million, or 49%, to $307 million in 2010. The Companys effective tax rates were 29% for 2010 and 26% for 2009. The net increase in the 2010 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 relating to the CEMIG sale transaction, tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowances at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, and $165 million of non taxable income recorded in 2009 at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program. These items were offset by income tax benefits related to a reversal of withholding tax liabilities at certain Chilean subsidiaries and 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries. Included in the net tax expense related to the CEMIG sale transaction is tax expense on the equity earnings associated with the reversal of the net long term liability and tax benefit related to release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. 147 Table of Contents Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $172 million, or 22%, to $599 million in 2009. The Companys effective tax rates were 26% for 2009 and 29% for 2008. The net decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowance at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recorded at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $91 million, or 99%, to $183 million in 2010 from $92 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a gain recognized upon the sale of our interest in CEMIG during the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by 2009 equity in earnings of Cartagena which was accounted for as a consolidated entity in 2010 and thus reported directly within revenues and expenses. Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $59 million, or 179%, to $92 million in 2009 from $33 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a cash settlement received by Cartagena, in Spain, in June 2009 for liquidated damages received related to a construction delay from December 2005 to November 2006; increased earnings at Guacolda in Chile mainly due to lower cost of coal; increased earnings of Chigen affiliates from higher tariffs partially offset by lower volume and a valuation write off in 2008 at an affiliate in Turkey. These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings at OPGC, in India, mainly due to lower tariff and a dividend distribution tax in March 2009 and increased expenses for an equipment overhaul at Elsta in the Netherlands. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $93 million, or 8%, to $1.0 billion in 2010 from $1.1 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreased earnings at Eletropaulo as a result of the absence of legal settlement income present in 2009, a loss on legal settlement at Gener and reduced revenues due to decreased coal prices along with higher electricity purchases at Itabo. These decreases were partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian Real. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $340 million, or 45%, to $1.1 billion in 2009 from $0.8 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to increases in gross margin and other income, lower interest expense and a decrease in impairments in 2009 at our Brazilian businesses, and increases in gross margin and foreign currency transaction gains at our businesses in Chile. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $44 million at certain of our wind generation businesses as a result of a charge related to the potential future taxes that could be deemed due in the calculation of the hypothetical liquidation value of certain of our wind tax equity partnerships. Discontinued operations As further discussed in Note 21 Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Businesses to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, Discontinued Operations includes the results of five businesses: Ras Laffan, a generation business in Qatar (sold in October 2010); Barka, a generation business in Oman, (sold in August 2010); Lal Pir and Pak Gen, generation businesses in Pakistan, (sold in June 2010); and Jiaozuo, a generation business in China, (sold in December 2008). Prior periods have been restated to reflect these businesses within Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. In 2010, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $39 million and reflected the operations of our 55% stake in Ras Laffan, a combined cycle gas facility and water desalination plant in Qatar, our 35% stake in Barka, a combined cycle gas 148 Table of Contents facility and water desalination plant in Oman and our 55% stake in Lal Pir and Pak Gen, two oil fired facilities in Pakistan. The sale of Lal Pir and Pak Gen closed in June 2010, resulting in additional impairment expense and a loss on the sale in 2010 of $14 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The Barka plant was sold in August 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $63 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The sale of Ras Laffan closed in October 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $6 million, net of tax. In 2009, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $54 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir and Pak Gen. Loss on disposal of discontinued businesses, net of tax and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $105 million and represented the difference between the net book value of the Companys interests in its Pakistan businesses and their estimated fair value. In 2008, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $60 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir, Pak Gen and Jiaozuo, a coal fired generation facility in China sold in December 2008. The Company received $73 million for its 70% interest in the business. The net gain on the disposition was $7 million. Critical Accounting Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Companys most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Reserves We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the tax jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material. 149 Table of Contents On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act). The Act includes several provisions which provide for tax relief for businesses by extending certain tax benefits and credits, including the Subpart F exception for active financing income and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look through provisions of Subpart F. This legislation resulted in a benefit for the Companys 2010 provision for income taxes; however, there can be no assurances that the benefits of this legislation will extend beyond 2011, when it is currently scheduled to expire. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Goodwill and Other Intangibles and Long lived Assets, respectively, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level on October 1. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying amount. A long lived asset (asset group) will be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e., the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are less than its carrying amount. In the event that the carrying amount of the long lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment evaluation is performed, in which the fair value of the asset is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. Examples of indicators that would result in an impairment test for goodwill and a recoverability test for long lived assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate, legislation changes or a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition. Throughout the impairment evaluation process, management makes considerable judgments; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part of an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost/benefit analysis and the Companys internal valuation knowledge of the long lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the DCF model), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factors expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. 150 Table of Contents A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Managements Discussion and Analysis, Consolidated Results of Operations Goodwill Impairment and Asset Impairment Expense and Note 19 Impairment Expense and Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Fair Value Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent), derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long term liabilities. The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Companys investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Companys derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where 151 Table of Contents derivatives qualify and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Companys interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Companys derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterpartys) and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Platts). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instruments fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on indicative pricing quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities The Company adopted the fair value measurement accounting guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009. The most significant of these estimates surround the fair value measurement of long lived tangible and intangible assets when tested for impairment upon a triggering event or during the annual impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill. These estimates include making assumptions regarding useful life, the impact of economic obsolescence and expected future cash flows. Additional factors are discussed above in the Impairments section. 152 Table of Contents Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard creates a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Long lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives. Long lived assets are evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are present. In assessing the recoverability of long lived assets, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margin growth rates, commodity prices and discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. Generally, the fair value of a long lived asset or asset group is determined using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each asset group. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets if we experience situations, including but not limited to, disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or adverse action or assessment by a regulator. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in additional long lived asset impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges. If current conditions in the global economy continue or worsen, this could increase the risk that we will have to impair long lived assets, as further described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather. Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In the past, our businesses in Latin America have been negatively impacted by lower than normal rainfall. Similarly, our wind businesses are dependent on adequate wind conditions while the solar projects at AES Solar are dependent on sufficient sunlight. In each case, inadequate wind or sunlight could have a material adverse impact on these businesses. Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes. Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our Utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to: changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations; 90 Table of Contents changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utilitys operating income or the rates it charges customers is too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates; changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non controllable costs; adverse changes in tax law; changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium; changes in the timing of tariff increases; other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business. Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business. In many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing or the regulations can be difficult to interpret. As a result, there is risk that we may not properly interpret certain regulations and may not understand the impact of certain regulations on our business. For example, in October 2006, ANEEL, which regulates our utility operations at Sul and Eletropaulo in Brazil, issued Normative Resolution 234 requiring that utilities begin amortizing a liability called Special Obligations beginning with their second tariff reset cycle in 2007 or a later year as an offset to depreciation expense. As of May 23, 2007, the date of the filing of our 2006 Form 10 K, no industry positions or any other consensus had been reached regarding how ANEEL guidance should be applied at that date and accordingly, no adjustments to the financial statements were made relating to Special Obligations in Brazil. Subsequent to May 23, 2007, industry discussions occurred and other Brazilian companies filed Forms 20 F with the SEC reflecting the impact of Resolution 234 in their December 31, 2006 financial statements differently from how the Company accounted for Resolution 234. In the absence of any significant regulatory developments between May 23, 2007 and the date of these other filings, the Company determined that Resolution 234 required us to record an adjustment to our Special Obligations liability as of December 31, 2006. In part, the decision to record the adjustment led to the restatement of our financial statements in the third quarter of 2007. If we face additional challenges interpreting regulations or changes in regulations, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act). While the bulk of regulations contained in the Dodd Frank Act regulate financial institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive compensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to public companies generally. The types of provisions described above are currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Furthermore, while the Dodd Frank Act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, the Dodd Frank Act provides for commercial end user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions, though this is not certain since the Act directs the SEC, CFTC and listed companies to enact rules that will clarify the Dodd Frank Act, and such rulemaking could impact the availability of the commercial end user exemption. Even if the exemption is available, the Dodd Frank Act could still have a material adverse impact on the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non exempt companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these risks. Even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, which could adversely affect the operating results of certain projects; cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated to hedge certain risks, such as project financing agreements; prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; cause the Company to abandon certain of its hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; and or consume substantial liquidity by forcing the Company to post cash and or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 91 Table of Contents On June 12, 2009 AES Kelanitissa received a letter and an invoice from the Director General, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUC) seeking payment of an Annual Regulatory Fee and pursuant to PUC assurances on an application for renewal of the AES Kelanitissa generation license. The application is pursuant to an April 2009 revision of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act (Electricity Act), which came into force in April 2009, notwithstanding that in March 29, 2001, AES Kelanitissa had been granted, and pre paid fees for, a 21 year generation license with effect from September 25, 2000 under the Electricity Act, 1950. AES Kelanitissa submitted an application to be licensed under the revised legislation and, on August 26, 2009, PUC published its intention to issue a generation license under the revised legislation to AES Kelanitissa and other Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in Sri Lanka. This was consistent with assurances received from relevant authorities that the revised legislation was to be amended to grandfather IPPs with existing generation licenses. In a letter dated June 21, 2010 from the PUC, AES Kelanitissa was informed that under the new regulations, as amended in 2009, AES Kelanitissa (Pvt) Ltd no longer fulfilled the eligibility criteria to apply for a generation license. The eligibility criteria to which the letter refers is a provision requiring an element of state ownership. Representatives of AES Kelanitissa have been informed that an amendment to the Electricity Act to grandfather existing IPPs remains in the legislative pipeline, although it is not possible to predict with certainty when or whether such an amendment will be passed. In addition, AES Kelanitissa believes that under Sri Lankan law, it may continue operations under the 21 year license issued in 2001. No step has been taken to date to prohibit AES Kelanitissa from generating power and conducting its operations. However, in the event that it is determined that AES Kelanitissa may not operate under its current license or the revised legislation is not amended (and PUC maintains that AES Kelanitissa is ineligible for a generation license or extension of the Generating License), AES Kelanitissa may not be able to continue operations on grounds that it has no license under the revised legislation. In that event, AES Kelanitissa and or the Company could face a number of adverse consequences, including potential litigation with counterparties mitigating a write down in the value of the assets of the business, continued default status under its debt documents and or other consequences which could have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Our Generation business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the FERC, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations. EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the obligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of the Midwest Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) Interconnection, L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is authorized under the new law to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case by case basis. While the new law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to PURPA, our QFs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long term contracts expire. EPAct 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the United States generation market. 92 Table of Contents In accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets. While the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost of service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate. Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our activities are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air and water emissions. See the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters of this Form 10 K. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies. The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal fired generating plants alleging wide spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with approximately 17 companies over such allegations. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. The principal focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO2 and NOX. In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOX. One of our businesses, IPL, is currently the subject of such an EPA enforcement action, and another business, Eastern Energy, has received an information request from the EPA in connection with a possible enforcement action. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10 K for more detail with respect to these EPA enforcement actions and information requests. There can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations. 93 Table of Contents Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As discussed in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations, at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect or policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2010, the Companys subsidiaries operated businesses which had total approximate CO2 emissions of 77.2 million metric tonnes approximately 40 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 18 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based upon a number of projections and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect such as the forecast dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO2 emissions and our subsidiaries achieving completion of such construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with emissions described below. Because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates. The subsidiaries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there can be no assurance that the subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the Company. Foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial performance. The actual impact on the Companys financial performance and the financial performance of the Companys subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the cost of emissions reduction equipment the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material impact on our results of operations. In January 2005, based on European Community Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading, the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) commenced operation as the largest multi country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the 40 developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO2. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In the United States, there currently is no legislation establishing federal mandatory GHG emission reduction programs (including CO2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. However, federal GHG legislation has been proposed in the United States Congress that would, if enacted, constrain GHG emissions, including CO2, and or impose costs on 94 Table of Contents us that could be material to our business or results of operations. The EPA has also initiated regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new sources of GHG emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing sources planning physical changes that would increase their GHG emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. Such regulations could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse effect on our business and or results of operations. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regulations. At the state level, RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast, became effective in January 2009, and the WCI is also developing market based programs to address GHG emissions in seven western states. In addition, several states, including California, have adopted comprehensive legislation that, when effective, will require mandatory GHG reductions from several industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about the United States state environmental regulations we face. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below), the Company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with United States federal, regional or state CO2 emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that these proposals are in earlier stages of development and any final regulations or legislation, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. The RGGI program became effective in January 2009. The first regional auction of RGGI allowances needed to be acquired by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI was held in September 2008, with subsequent auctions occurring approximately every quarter. Our subsidiaries in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland are subject to RGGI. Of the approximately 40 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2010 (ownership adjusted), approximately 11.3 million metric tonnes were emitted in United States states participating in RGGI. Over the past three years, such emissions have averaged approximately 10.9 million metric tonnes. While CO2 emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of CO2 compliance based on a 3 year average of CO2 emissions for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes a price of $1.86 per allowance under RGGI. The source of this allowance price estimate was the clearing price in the recent RGGI allowance auction held in December 2010. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $15 million for 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance. In addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. For example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. In addition, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. In addition, environmental groups and other private plaintiffs have brought and may decide to bring additional private lawsuits against the Company because of its subsidiaries GHG emissions. The Company is facing and may face in the future private lawsuits relating to GHG emissions that may have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. In one recent case in the United States, which does not involve the Company, a federal appellate court reversed the dismissal by a federal district court of nuisance and other claims against emitters of GHG based on property damage allegedly caused by their contributions to global warming. While the scope of relief sought in that case is 95 Table of Contents unclear, the plaintiffs in this case evidently seek injunctive relief to prevent or reduce further GHG emissions. The defendants appealed the appellate court decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court is expected to render a decision in 2011. If the defendants do not prevail, other parties may be encouraged to bring similar suits against electric power generators, including the Company or any of its United States subsidiaries. Also, unless the United States Congress acts to preempt such suits as part of comprehensive federal legislation, additional lawsuits may be brought against the Company or its subsidiaries. At this stage of the litigation, it is impossible to predict whether such lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the Companys business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Companys subsidiaries. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel fired electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation. In addition to potential physical risks noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of the Company and its subsidiaries due to public perception of GHG emissions by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHG emissions made by subsidiaries of the Company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the Company. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the Companys subsidiaries and on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our subsidiaries have operations in the United States and various non United States jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many non United States jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as non United States, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities. We and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. We and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. 96 Table of Contents The SEC is conducting an informal inquiry relating to our restatements. We have been cooperating with an informal inquiry by the SEC Staff concerning our past restatements and related matters, and have been providing information and documents to the SEC Staff on a voluntary basis. Although we have not received correspondence regarding this inquiry for some time, we have not been advised that the matter is closed. Because we are unable to predict the outcome of this inquiry, the SEC Staff may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported the financial impact of the adjustments to previously filed financial statements and there may be a risk that the inquiry by the SEC could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate previously filed financial statements, amend prior filings or take other actions not currently contemplated. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We maintain offices in many places around the world, generally pursuant to the provisions of long and short term leases, none of which we believe are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are described in Item 1 of this Form 10 K, are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the projects related finance facility. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased. However, in a few instances, no accompanying project financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business, some of which are described below. The Company has accrued for litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has evaluated claims in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies that it deems both probable and reasonably estimable and accordingly, has recorded aggregate reserves for all claims for approximately $450 million and $482 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. These are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within accrued and other liabilities and other long term liabilities. A significant portion of these reserves relate to employment, non income tax and customer disputes in international jurisdictions, principally Brazil. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries, principally in Brazil, are defendants in a number of labor and employment lawsuits. The complaints generally seek unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or other relief. The subsidiaries have denied any liability and intend to vigorously defend themselves in all of these proceedings. There can be no assurance that this reserve will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise. The Company believes, based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. However, even where no reserve has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company, and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material. In 1989, Centrais El&eacute;tricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobr&aacute;s) filed suit in the Fifth District Court in the State of Rio de Janeiro against Eletropaulo Eletricidade de S&atilde;o Paulo S.A. (EEDSP) relating to the methodology for calculating monetary adjustments under the parties financing agreement. In April 1999, the Fifth District Court 97 Table of Contents found for Eletrobr&aacute;s and in September 2001, Eletrobr&aacute;s initiated an execution suit in the Fifth District Court to collect approximately R$1.10 billion ($659 million) from Eletropaulo (as estimated by Eletropaulo) and a lesser amount from an unrelated company, Companhia de Transmiss&atilde;o de Energia El&eacute;trica Paulista (CTEEP) (Eletropaulo and CTEEP were spun off from EEDSP pursuant to its privatization in 1998). In November 2002, the Fifth District Court rejected Eletropaulos defenses in the execution suit. Eletropaulo appealed and in September 2003, the Appellate Court of the State of Rio de Janeiro (AC) ruled that Eletropaulo was not a proper party to the litigation because any alleged liability had been transferred to CTEEP pursuant to the privatization. In June 2006, the Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) reversed the Appellate Courts decision and remanded the case to the Fifth District Court for further proceedings, holding that Eletropaulos liability, if any, should be determined by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulos subsequent appeals to the Special Court (the highest court within the SCJ) and the Supreme Court of Brazil were dismissed. Eletrobr&aacute;s later requested that the amount of Eletropaulos alleged debt be determined by an accounting expert appointed by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulo consented to the appointment of such an expert, subject to a reservation of rights. In February 2010, the Fifth District Court appointed an accounting expert to determine the amount of the alleged debt and the responsibility for its payment in light of the privatization, in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletrobr&aacute;s. Pursuant to its reservation of rights, Eletropaulo filed an interlocutory appeal with the AC asserting that the expert was required to determine the issues in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletropaulo, and that Eletropaulo should be entitled to take discovery and present arguments on the issues to be determined by the expert. In April 2010, the AC issued a decision agreeing with Eletropaulos arguments and directing the Fifth District Court to proceed accordingly. Eletrobr&aacute;s may restart the accounting proceedings at the Fifth District Court at any time, which would proceed according to the ACs April 2010 decision. In the Fifth District Court proceedings, the experts conclusions will be subject to the Fifth District Courts review and approval. If Eletropaulo is determined to be responsible for the debt, after the amount of the alleged debt is determined, Eletrobr&aacute;s will be entitled to resume the execution suit in the Fifth District Court at any time. If Eletrobr&aacute;s does so, Eletropaulo will be required to provide security in the amount of its alleged liability. In that case, if Eletrobr&aacute;s requests the seizure of such security and the Fifth District Court grants such request, Eletropaulos results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and in turn the Companys results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, in February 2008, CTEEP filed a lawsuit in the Fifth District Court against Eletrobr&aacute;s and Eletropaulo seeking a declaration that CTEEP is not liable for any debt under the financing agreement. The parties are disputing the proper venue for the CTEEP lawsuit. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In August 2000, the FERC announced an investigation into the organized California wholesale power markets to determine whether rates were just and reasonable. Further investigations involved alleged market manipulation. FERC requested documents from each of the AES Southland, LLC plants and AES Placerita, Inc. AES Southland and AES Placerita have cooperated fully with the FERC investigations. AES Southland was not subject to refund liability because it did not sell into the organized spot markets due to the nature of its tolling agreement. After hearings at FERC, AES Placerita was found subject to refund liability of $588,000 plus interest for spot sales to the California Power Exchange from October 2, 2000 to June 20, 2001. As FERC investigations and hearings progressed, numerous appeals on related issues were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Over the years, the Ninth Circuit issued several opinions that had the potential to expand the scope of the FERC proceedings and increase refund exposure for AES Placerita and other sellers of electricity. Following remand of one of the Ninth Circuit appeals in March 2009, FERC started a new hearing process involving AES Placerita and other sellers. In May 2009, AES Placerita entered into a settlement, approved by FERC in July 2009, concerning the claims before FERC against AES Placerita relating to the California energy crisis of 2000 2001, including the California refund proceeding. Pursuant to the settlement, AES Placerita paid $6 million and assigned a receivable of $168,119 due to it from the California Power Exchange in return for a release of all claims against it at FERC by the settling parties and other consideration. More than 98% of the buyers in the market elected to join the settlement. A small amount of AES Placeritas settlement payment was placed in escrow for buyers that did not join the settlement (non settling parties). It is unclear whether the escrowed funds will be enough to satisfy any additional sums that might be determined to be owed to 98 Table of Contents non settling parties at the conclusion of the FERC proceedings concerning the California energy crisis. However, any such additional sums are expected to be immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2009, one non settling party, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), filed an appeal of the FERCs approval of the settlement which is pending in the Ninth Circuit. SMUDs appeal has been stayed pending further order of the court. The settlement agreement is still effective and will continue to remain effective unless it is vacated by the Ninth Circuit. SMUD has reached a settlement in principal with buyers of electricity that, if approved by FERC, will leave only immaterial claims of non settling parties against AES Placerita. In August 2001, the Grid Corporation of Orissa, India, now Gridco Ltd. (Gridco), filed a petition against the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (CESCO), an affiliate of the Company, with the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC), alleging that CESCO had defaulted on its obligations as an OERC licensed distribution company, that CESCO management abandoned the management of CESCO, and asking for interim measures of protection, including the appointment of an administrator to manage CESCO. Gridco, a state owned entity, is the sole wholesale energy provider to CESCO. Pursuant to the OERCs August 2001 order, the management of CESCO was replaced with a government administrator who was appointed by the OERC. The OERC later held that the Company and other CESCO shareholders were not necessary or proper parties to the OERC proceeding. In August 2004, the OERC issued a notice to CESCO, the Company and others giving the recipients of the notice until November 2004 to show cause why CESCOs distribution license should not be revoked. In response, CESCO submitted a business plan to the OERC. In February 2005, the OERC issued an order rejecting the proposed business plan. The order also stated that the CESCO distribution license would be revoked if an acceptable business plan for CESCO was not submitted to and approved by the OERC prior to March 31, 2005. In its April 2, 2005 order, the OERC revoked the CESCO distribution license. CESCO has filed an appeal against the April 2, 2005 OERC order and that appeal remains pending in the Indian courts. In addition, Gridco asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Companys indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCOs financial obligations to Gridco. In December 2001, Gridco served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limited (AES ODPL), and Jyoti Structures (Jyoti) pursuant to the terms of the CESCO Shareholders Agreement between Gridco, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and CESCO (the CESCO arbitration). In the arbitration, Gridco appeared to be seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by Gridco. The Company counterclaimed against Gridco for damages. In June 2007, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting Gridcos claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to Gridco. The respondents counterclaims were also rejected. In September 2007, Gridco filed a challenge of the arbitration award with the local Indian court. In June 2008, Gridco filed a separate application with the local Indian court for an order enjoining the Company from selling or otherwise transferring its shares in Orissa Power Generation Corporation Ltd.s (OPGC), an equity method investment, and requiring the Company to provide security in the amount of the contested damages in the CESCO arbitration until Gridcos challenge to the arbitration award is resolved. In June 2010, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal awarded the Company some of its costs relating to the arbitration. In August 2010, Gridco filed a challenge of the cost award with the local Indian court. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In early 2002, Gridco made an application to the OERC requesting that the OERC initiate proceedings regarding the terms of OPGCs existing PPA with Gridco. In response, OPGC filed a petition in the Indian courts to block any such OERC proceedings. In early 2005, the Orissa High Court upheld the OERCs jurisdiction to initiate such proceedings as requested by Gridco. OPGC appealed that High Courts decision to the Supreme Court and sought stays of both the High Courts decision and the underlying OERC proceedings regarding the PPAs terms. In April 2005, the Supreme Court granted OPGCs requests and ordered stays of the High Courts decision and the OERC proceedings with respect to the PPAs terms. The matter is awaiting further hearing. 99 Table of Contents Unless the Supreme Court finds in favor of OPGCs appeal or otherwise prevents the OERCs proceedings regarding the PPAs terms, the OERC will likely lower the tariff payable to OPGC under the PPA, which would have an adverse impact on OPGCs financials. OPGC believes that it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In March 2003, the office of the Federal Public Prosecutor for the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (MPF) notified AES Eletropaulo that it had commenced an inquiry related to the BNDES financings provided to AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and the rationing loan provided to Eletropaulo, changes in the control of Eletropaulo, sales of assets by Eletropaulo and the quality of service provided by Eletropaulo to its customers, and requested various documents from Eletropaulo relating to these matters. In July 2004, the MPF filed a public civil lawsuit in the Federal Court of S&atilde;o Paulo (FSCP) alleging that BNDES violated Law 8429/92 (the Administrative Misconduct Act) and BNDESs internal rules by: (1) approving the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (2) extending the payment terms on the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (3) authorizing the sale of Eletropaulos preferred shares at a stock market auction; (4) accepting Eletropaulos preferred shares to secure the loan provided to Eletropaulo; and (5) allowing the restructurings of Light Servi&ccedil;os de Eletricidade S.A. and Eletropaulo. The MPF also named AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s as defendants in the lawsuit because they allegedly benefited from BNDESs alleged violations. In May 2006, the FCSP ruled that the MPF could pursue its claims based on the first, second, and fourth alleged violations noted above. The MPF subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal with the Federal Court of Appeals (FCA) seeking to require the FCSP to consider all five alleged violations. Also, in July 2006, AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s filed an interlocutory appeal with the FCA, which was subsequently consolidated with the MPFs interlocutory appeal, seeking a transfer of venue and to enjoin the FCSP from considering any of the alleged violations. In June 2009, the FCA granted the injunction sought by AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and transferred the case to the Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro. In May 2010, the MPF filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice challenging the transfer. The MPFs lawsuit before the FCSP has been stayed pending a final decision on the interlocutory appeals. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana (the successor of AES Transg&aacute;s) believe they have meritorious defenses to the allegations asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. AES Florestal, Ltd. (Florestal), had been operating a pole factory and had other assets, including a wooded area known as Horto Renner, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (collectively, Property). Florestal had been under the control of AES Sul (Sul) since October 1997, when Sul was created pursuant to a privatization by the Government of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. After it came under the control of Sul, Florestal performed an environmental audit of the entire operational cycle at the pole factory. The audit discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at the pole factory. The audit concluded that the prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia El&eacute;trica (CEEE), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. Sul and Florestal subsequently took the initiative of communicating with Brazilian authorities, as well as CEEE, about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. The Public Attorneys Office has initiated a civil inquiry (Civil Inquiry n. 24/05) to investigate potential civil liability and has requested that the police station of Triunfo institute a police investigation (IP number 1041/05) to investigate potential criminal liability regarding the contamination at the pole factory. The parties filed defenses in response to the civil inquiry. The Public Attorneys Office then requested an injunction which the judge rejected on September 26, 2008. The Public Attorneys office has a right to appeal the decision. The environmental agency (FEPAM) has also started a procedure (Procedure n. 088200567/059) to analyze the measures that shall be taken to contain and remediate the contamination. Also, in March 2000, Sul filed suit against CEEE in the 2nd Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre seeking to register in Suls name the Property that it acquired through the privatization but that remained registered in CEEEs name. During those proceedings, AES subsequently waived its claim to re register the Property and asserted a claim to recover the amounts paid for the Property. That claim is pending. In November 2005, the 7th Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre ruled that the Property must be returned to CEEE. CEEE has had sole possession of Horto Renner since September 2006 and of the rest of the Property since April 2006. In February 2008, Sul 100 Table of Contents and CEEE signed a Technical Cooperation Protocol pursuant to which they requested a new deadline from FEPAM in order to present a proposal. In March 2008, the State Prosecution office filed a Public Class Action against AES Florestal, AES Sul and CEEE, requiring an injunction for the removal of the alleged sources of contamination and the payment of an indemnity in the amount of R$6 million ($4 million). The injunction was rejected and the case is in the evidentiary stage awaiting the judges determination concerning the production of expert evidence. The above referenced proposal was delivered on April 8, 2008. FEPAM responded by indicating that the parties should undertake the first step of the proposal which would be to retain a contractor. In its response, Sul indicated that such step should be undertaken by CEEE as the relevant environmental events resulted from CEEEs operations. It is estimated that remediation could cost approximately R$14.7 million ($9 million). Discussions between Sul and CEEE are ongoing. In January 2004, the Company received notice of a Formulation of Charges filed against the Company by the Superintendence of Electricity of the Dominican Republic. In the Formulation of Charges, the Superintendence asserts that the existence of three generation companies (Empresa Generadora de Electricidad Itabo, S.A. (Itabo), Dominican Power Partners, and AES Andres BV) and one distribution company (Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S.A. (Este)) in the Dominican Republic, violates certain cross ownership restrictions contained in the General Electricity Law of the Dominican Republic. In February 2004, the Company filed in the First Instance Court of the National District of the Dominican Republic an action seeking injunctive relief based on several constitutional due process violations contained in the Formulation of Charges (Constitutional Injunction). In February 2004, the Court granted the Constitutional Injunction and ordered the immediate cessation of any effects of the Formulation of Charges, and the enactment by the Superintendence of Electricity of a special procedure to prosecute alleged antitrust complaints under the General Electricity Law. In March 2004, the Superintendence of Electricity appealed the Courts decision. In July 2004, the Company divested any interest in Este. The Superintendence of Electricitys appeal is pending. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July 2004, the Corporaci&oacute;n Dominicana de Empresas El&eacute;ctricas Estatales (CDEEE) filed lawsuits against Itabo, an affiliate of the Company, in the First and Fifth Chambers of the Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance for the National District. CDEEE alleges in both lawsuits that Itabo spent more than was necessary to rehabilitate two generation units of an Itabo power plant and, in the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, that those funds were paid to affiliates and subsidiaries of AES Gener and Coastal Itabo, Ltd. (Coastal), a former shareholder of Itabo, without the required approval of Itabos board of administration. In the First Chamber lawsuit, CDEEE seeks an accounting of Itabos transactions relating to the rehabilitation. In November 2004, the First Chamber dismissed the case for lack of legal basis. On appeal, in October 2005 the Court of Appeals of Santo Domingo ruled in Itabos favor, reasoning that it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute because the parties contracts mandated arbitration. The Supreme Court of Justice is considering CDEEEs appeal of the Court of Appeals decision. In the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, which also names Itabos former president as a defendant, CDEEE seeks $15 million in damages and the seizure of Itabos assets. In October 2005, the Fifth Chamber held that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute given the arbitration provisions in the parties contracts. The First Chamber of the Court of Appeal ratified that decision in September 2006. In a related proceeding, in May 2005, Itabo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to compel CDEEE to arbitrate its claims. The petition was denied in July 2005. Itabos appeal of that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has been stayed since September 2006. Further, in September 2006, in an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration, an arbitral tribunal determined that it lacked jurisdiction to decide arbitration claims concerning these disputes. Itabo believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In April 2006, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi (District Court) on behalf of certain individual plaintiffs and all residents and or property owners in the State of Mississippi who allegedly suffered harm as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, whose alleged greenhouse gas emissions contributed to alleged global 101 Table of Contents warming which, in turn, allegedly increased the destructive capacity of Hurricane Katrina. The plaintiffs assert unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy/aiding and abetting, public and private nuisance, trespass, negligence, and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment claims against the defendants. The plaintiffs seek damages relating to loss of property, loss of business, clean up costs, personal injuries and death, but do not quantify their alleged damages. In August 2007, the District Court dismissed the case. The plaintiffs subsequently appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which, in October 2009, affirmed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs unjust enrichment, fraudulent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy claims. However, the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence claims, and remanded those claims to the District Court for further proceedings. In February 2010, the Fifth Circuit granted the petitions for en banc rehearing filed by the Company and other defendants, and thereby vacated its October 2009 decision. In May 2010, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had lost its quorum for en banc review. In August 2010, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the U.S. Supreme Court, requesting the Supreme Court to direct the Fifth Circuit to reinstate the appeal and return it to the panel that issued the October 2009 decision. In January 2011, the Supreme Court denied the petition, ending the case. In July 2007, the Competition Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the Competition Committee) ordered Nurenergoservice, an AES subsidiary, to pay approximately KZT 18 billion ($120 million) for alleged antimonopoly violations in 2005 through the first quarter of 2007. The Competition Committees order was affirmed by the economic court in April 2008 (April 2008 Decision). The economic court also issued an injunction to secure Nurenergoservices alleged liability, freezing Nurenergoservices bank accounts and prohibiting Nurenergoservice from transferring or disposing of its property. Nurenergoservices subsequent appeals to the court of appeals were rejected. In February 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency (the Competition Committees successor) seized approximately KZT 783 million ($5 million) from a frozen Nurenergoservice bank account in partial satisfaction of Nurenergoservices alleged damages liability. However, on appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court, in October 2009, the Supreme Court annulled the decisions of the lower courts because of procedural irregularities and remanded the case to the economic court for reconsideration. On remand, in January 2010, the economic court reaffirmed its April 2008 Decision. Nurenergoservices appeals in the court of appeals (first panel) and the court of appeals (second panel) were unsuccessful. Nurenergoservice intends to file a further appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court. In separate but related proceedings, in August 2007, the Competition Committee ordered Nurenergoservice to pay approximately KZT 1.8 billion ($12 million) in administrative fines for its alleged antimonopoly violations. Nurenergoservices appeal to the administrative court was rejected in February 2009. Given the adverse court decisions against Nurenergoservice, the Antimonopoly Agency may attempt to seize Nurenergoservices remaining assets, which are immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Antimonopoly Agency has not indicated whether it intends to assert claims against Nurenergoservice for alleged antimonopoly violations post first quarter 2007. Nurenergoservice believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it; however, there can be no assurances that it will prevail in these proceedings. In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of the power sales of Ust Kamenogorsk HPP (UK HPP) and Shulbinsk HPP, hydroelectric plants under AES concession (collectively, the Hydros), in January through February 2009. The investigation of Shulbinsk HPP is ongoing, but the investigation of UK HPP has been completed. The Antimonopoly Agency determined that UK HPP abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power in January through February 2009. The Agency sought an order from the administrative court requiring UK HPP to pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 120 million ($1 million) and to disgorge profits for the period at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately KZT 440 million ($3 million). No fines or damages have been paid to date, however, as the proceedings in the administrative court have been suspended due to the initiation of related criminal proceedings against officials of UK HPP. The Hydros believe they have meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. 102 Table of Contents In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of Ust Kamenogorsk TETS LLPs (UKT) power sales in 2008 through February 2009. The Antimonopoly Agency subsequently concluded that UKT abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power and should pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 136 million ($1 million). The Antimonopoly Agency later sought an order from the administrative court requiring UKT to pay the fine. The administrative court proceedings have been suspended due to a related criminal investigation of UKT employees. If the investigation is terminated and the Antimonopoly Agency prevails in the administrative proceedings, UKT may be ordered to pay the administrative fine and disgorge the profits from the sales at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately 514 million KZT ($3 million). UKT believes it has meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In December 2007, an arbitral tribunal terminated ESSAs gas supply contracts with members of the Sierra Chata Consortium in light of the restrictions that had been placed on the export of gas by the Argentine Republic. ESSA thereafter terminated its gas transportation contract with Transportadora de Gas del Norte S.A. (TGN), and initiated arbitration seeking relief from the obligation to pay the firm tariff under ESSAs gas transportation contracts with Gasoducto GasAndes (Argentina) S.A. (GasAndes Argentina) and Gasoducto GasAndes S.A. (GasAndes Chile) or in the alternative, termination of such contracts. TGN (which later filed a lawsuit against ESSA in Argentina), GasAndes Argentina, and GasAndes Chile disputed that the restrictions on the export of gas justified the adjustment or termination of the respective gas transportation contracts and sought due tariff payments. On December 29, 2010, ESSA reached settlement agreements with GasAndes Argentina, GasAndes Chile, and TGN terminating the respective gas transportation contracts and resolving all pending legal disputes and potential future claims. ESSA recognized approximately $72 million as other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2010 related to the settlement agreements. Upon termination of the TGN gas transportation contract, ESSA is no longer required to pay certain charges imposed by the Argentine Republic relating to gas supply infrastructure. In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina, Alaska, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, claiming that the defendants alleged GHG emissions have contributed to alleged global warming which, in turn, allegedly has led to the erosion of the plaintiffs alleged land. The plaintiffs assert nuisance and concert of action claims against the Company and the other defendants, and a conspiracy claim against a subset of the other defendants. The plaintiffs seek to recover relocation costs, indicated in the complaint to be from $95 million to $400 million, and other unspecified damages from the defendants. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the District Court granted in October 2009. The plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The parties have briefed the appeal and are awaiting a date for oral argument. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July, 1993 the Public Attorneys office filed a claim against Eletropaulo, the Sao Paulo State Government, SABESP (a state owned company), CETESB (a state owned company) and DAEE (the municipal Water and Electric Energy Department) alleging that they were liable for pollution of the Billings Reservoir as a result of pumping water from the Pinheiros River into the Billings Reservoir. The events in question occurred while Eletropaulo was a state owned company. An initial lower court decision in 2007 found the parties liable for the payment of approximately R$670 million ($401 million) for remediation. Eletropaulo subsequently appealed the decision to the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo which reversed the lower court decision. In 2009, the Public Attorneys Office has filed appeals to both Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) and the Supreme Court (SC) and such appeals were answered by Eletropaulo in the fourth quarter of 2009. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 1996, a public civil action was asserted against Eletropaulo and Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Desportiva Cultural Eletropaulo (the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o) relating to alleged environmental damage caused by construction of the 103 Table of Contents Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o near Guarapiranga Reservoir. The initial decision that was upheld by the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo in 2006 found that Eletropaulo should repair the alleged environmental damage by demolishing certain construction and reforesting the area, and either sponsor an environmental project which would cost approximately R$1 million ($599 thousand) as of December 31, 2010, or pay an indemnification amount of approximately R$10.2 million ($6 million). Eletropaulo has appealed this decision to the Supreme Court and is awaiting a decision. In February 2009, a CAA Section 114 information request from the EPA regarding Cayuga and Somerset was received. The request seeks various operating and testing data and other information regarding certain types of projects at the Cayuga and Somerset facilities, generally for the time period from January 1, 2000 through the date of the information request. This type of information request has been used in the past to assist the EPA in determining whether a plant is in compliance with applicable standards under the CAA. Cayuga and Somerset responded to the EPAs information request in June 2009, and they are awaiting a response from the EPA regarding their submittal. At this time, it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this request may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position. On February 2, 2009, the Cayuga facility received a Notice of Violation from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) that the facility had exceeded the permitted volume limit of coal ash that can be disposed of in the on site landfill. Cayuga has met with NYSDEC and submitted a Landfill Liner Demonstration Report to them. Such report found that the landfill has adequate engineering integrity to support the additional coal ash and there is no inherent environmental threat. NYSDEC has indicated they accept the finding of the report. A permit modification was approved by the NYSDEC on May 14, 2010 and such permit modification allows for closure of this approximately 10 acre portion of the landfill. The construction in accordance with the approved permit modification was completed in November 2010 and the certification report for this construction project is currently being drafted to submit to the NYSDEC in the second quarter of 2011. While at this time it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this matter may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position, based upon the discussions to date, the Company does not believe the impact will be material. In March 2009, AES Uruguaiana Empreendimentos S.A. (AESU) initiated arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against YPF S.A. (YPF) seeking damages and other relief relating to YPFs breach of the parties gas supply agreement (GSA). Thereafter, in April 2009, YPF initiated arbitration in the ICC against AESU and two unrelated parties, Companhia de Gas do Esado do Rio Grande do Sul and Transportador de Gas del Mercosur S.A. (TGM), claiming that AESU wrongfully terminated the GSA and caused the termination of a transportation agreement (TA) between YPF and TGM (YPF Arbitration). YPF seeks an unspecified amount of damages from AESU, a declaration that YPFs performance was excused under the GSA due to certain alleged force majeure events, or, in the alternative, a declaration that the GSA and the TA should be terminated without a finding of liability against YPF because of the allegedly onerous obligations imposed on YPF by those agreements. In addition, in the YPF Arbitration, TGM asserts that if it is determined that AESU is responsible for the termination of the GSA, AESU is liable for TGMs alleged losses, including losses under the TA. The procedural schedules for the arbitrations have been established but the hearing dates have not been scheduled to date. AESU believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit 104 Table of Contents was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. In June 2009, the Inter American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States (IACHR) requested that the Republic of Panama suspend the construction of AES Changuinola S.A.s hydroelectric project (Project) until the bodies of the Inter American human rights system can issue a final decision on a petition (286/08) claiming that the construction violates the human rights of alleged indigenous communities. In July 2009, Panama responded by informing the IACHR that it would not suspend construction of the Project and requesting that the IACHR revoke its request. In June 2010, the Inter American Court of Human Rights vacated the IACHRs request. With respect to the merits of the underlying petition, the IACHR heard arguments by the communities and Panama in November 2009, but has not issued a decision to date. The Company cannot predict Panamas response to any determination on the merits of the petition by the bodies of the Inter American human rights system. In July 2009, AES Energ&iacute;a Cartagena S.R.L. (AES Cartagena) received notices from the Spanish national energy regulator, Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de Energ&iacute;a (CNE), stating that the proceeds of the sale of electricity from AES Cartagenas plant should be reduced by roughly the value of the CO2 allowances that were granted to AES Cartagena for free for the years 2007, 2008, and the first half of 2009. In particular, the notices stated that CNE intended to invoice AES Cartagena to recover that value, which CNE calculated as approximately 20 million ($27 million) for 2007 2008 and an amount to be determined for the first half of 2009. In September 2009, AES Cartagena received invoices for 523,548 (approximately $694,000) for the allowances granted for free for 2007 and 19,907,248 (approximately $26 million) for 2008. In July 2010, AES Cartagena received an invoice for approximately 5.4 million ($7 million) for the allowances granted for free for the first half of 2009. AES Cartagena does not expect to be charged for CO2 allowances issued free of charge for subsequent periods. AES Cartagena has paid the amounts invoiced and has filed challenges to the CNEs demands in the Spanish judicial system. There can be no assurances that the challenges will be successful. AES Cartagena has demanded indemnification from its fuel supply and electricity toller, GDF Suez, in relation to the CNE invoices under the long term energy agreement (the Energy Agreement) with GDF Suez. However, GDF Suez has disputed that it is responsible for the CNE invoices under the Energy Agreement. Therefore, in September 2009, AES Cartagena initiated arbitration against GDF Suez, seeking to recover the payments made to CNE. In the arbitration, AES Cartagena also seeks a determination that GDF Suez is responsible for procuring and bearing the cost of CO2 allowances that are required to offset the CO2 emissions of AES Cartagenas power plant, which is also in dispute between the parties. To date, AES Cartagena has paid approximately 20 million ($27 million) for the CO2 allowances that have been required to offset 2008 and 2009 CO2 emissions. AES Cartagena expects that allowances will need to be purchased to offset emissions for subsequent years. The evidentiary hearing in the arbitration took place from May 31 June 4, 2010, and closing arguments were heard on September 1, 2010. In February 2011, the arbitral tribunal requested further briefing from the parties on certain issues in the arbitration. If AES Cartagena does not prevail in the arbitration and is required to bear the cost of carbon compliance, its results of operations could be materially adversely affected and, in turn, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company and its results of operations. AES Cartagena believes it has meritorious claims and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 2009, the Public Defenders Office of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (PDO) filed a class action against AES Sul in the 16th District Court of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (District Court), claiming that AES Sul has been illegally passing PIS and COFINS taxes (taxes based on AES Suls income) to consumers. According to ANEELs Order No. 93/05, the federal laws of Brazil, and the Brazilian Constitution, energy companies such as AES Sul are entitled to highlight PIS and COFINS taxes in power bills to final consumers, as the cost of those taxes is included in the energy tariffs that are applicable to final consumers. Before AES Sul had 105 Table of Contents been served with the action, the District Court dismissed the lawsuit in October 2009 on the ground that AES Sul had been properly highlighting PIS and COFINS taxes in consumer bills in accordance with Brazilian law. In April 2010, the PDO appealed to the Appellate Court of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (AC). In November 2010, the AC affirmed the dismissal. The PDO is expected to appeal. If the dismissal is ever reversed and AES Sul does not prevail in the lawsuit and is ordered to cease recovering PIS and COFINS taxes pursuant to its energy tariff, its potential prospective losses could be approximately R$9.6 million ($6 million) per month, as estimated by AES Sul. In addition, if AES Sul is ordered to reimburse consumers, its potential retrospective liability could be approximately R$1.2 billion ($718 million), as estimated by AES Sul. AES Sul believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings if it is served with the action; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in its efforts. Furthermore, if AES Sul does not prevail in the litigation it will seek to adjust its energy tariff to compensate it for its losses, but there can be no assurances that it would be successful in obtaining an adjusted energy tariff. In October 2009, IPL received a Notice of Violation (NOV) and Finding of Violation from EPA pursuant to CAA Section 113(a). The NOV alleges violations of the CAA at IPLs three coal fired electric generating facilities dating back to 1986. The alleged violations primarily pertain to EPAs Prevention of Significant Deterioration and nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) requirements under the CAA. Since receiving the letter, IPL management has met with EPA staff and is currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of similar cases have required companies to pay civil penalties and to install additional pollution control technology on coal fired electric generating units. A similar outcome in this case could have a material impact to IPL and could, in turn, have a material impact on the Company. IPL would seek recovery through customer rates of any operating or capital expenditures related to pollution control technology systems to reduce regulated air emissions; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in that regard. In November 2009, April 2010 and December 2010, substantially similar personal injury lawsuits were filed by a total of 26 residents and estates in the Dominican Republic against the Company, AES Atlantis, Inc., AES Puerto Rico, LP, AES Puerto Rico, Inc., and AES Puerto Rico Services, Inc., in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware. In each lawsuit the plaintiffs allege that the coal combustion byproducts of AES Puerto Ricos power plant were illegally placed in the Dominican Republic in October 2003 through March 2004 and subsequently caused the plaintiffs birth defects, other personal injuries, and or deaths. The plaintiffs do not quantify their alleged damages, but generally allege that they are entitled to compensatory and punitive damages. The AES defendants have moved for partial dismissal of both the November 2009 and April 2010 lawsuits on various grounds. (The AES Defendants have until mid February to respond to the December 2010 lawsuit.) In September 2010, the Superior Court heard arguments on the motions. The Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs fraud allegations without prejudice to replead, and the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in November 2010. The AES defendants have filed a renewed motion to dismiss the amended issues. The remaining claims (other than fraud) addressed in the AES defendants original motion to dismiss are still pending. The AES defendants believe they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. On December 21, 2010, AES 3C Maritza East 1 EOOD, which owns an unfinished 670MW lignite fired power plant in Bulgaria, made the first in a series of demands on the performance bond securing the construction Contractors obligations under the parties EPC Contract. The Contractor failed to complete the plant on schedule. The total amount demanded by Maritza under the performance bond is approximately 155 million ($205 million). However, the Contractor obtained a temporary injunction from a French court preventing the issuing bank from honoring the bond demands. As the performance bond is governed by English law, Maritza obtained a judgment from an English court that the bond should be paid, and then presented this judgment to the French court which issued the temporary injunction. However, on February 10, 2011, the French court issued a decision enjoining the issuing bank from honoring the demands on the performance bond pending the determination of the arbitration between Maritza and the Contractor, described below. Maritza is attempting to 106 Table of Contents lift that injunction or otherwise obtain payment on its demands. In addition, in December 2010, the Contractor issued a notice of dispute alleging that the lignite that has been supplied by Maritza for commissioning of the power plant is out of specification, allegedly entitling the Contractor to an extension of time to complete the power plant, an increase to the contract price of approximately 62 million ($82 million), and other relief. The Contractor thereafter advised Maritza that it had stopped commissioning of the power plants two units because of the characteristics of the lignite supplied, and, in January 2011, initiated arbitration on its lignite claim. Maritza disputes that the lignite is out of specification and intends to defend the arbitration and assert counterclaims for delay liquidated damages and other relief relating to the Contractors failure to complete the power plant and other breaches of the EPC contract. Maritza believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. ITEM 4. REMOVED AND RESERVED 107 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On March 12, 2010, the Company and Terrific Investment Corporation (Investor), a wholly owned subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, entered into a stockholder agreement (the Stockholder Agreement) in connection with the agreement discussed in the following paragraph. Under the Stockholder Agreement, as long as Investor holds more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, Investor will have the right to designate one nominee, who must be reasonably acceptable to the Board, for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. Investor has not designated its nominee for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, until such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock, Investor has agreed to vote its shares in accordance with the recommendation of the Company on any matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company relating to the election of directors and compensation matters. Otherwise, Investor may vote its shares at its discretion. Further, under the Stockholder Agreement, Investor will be subject to a standstill restriction which generally prohibits Investor from purchasing additional securities of the Company beyond the level acquired by it under the stock purchase agreement entered into between Investor and the Company on November 6, 2009. In addition, Investor has agreed to a lock up restriction such that Investor would not sell its shares for a period of 12 months following the closing, subject to certain exceptions. The standstill and lock up restrictions also terminate at such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock. Investor will have certain registration rights and preemptive rights under the Stockholder Agreement with respect to its shares of common stock of the Company. On March 15, 2010, the Company completed the sale of 125,468,788 shares of common stock to Investor. The shares were sold for $12.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.58 billion. Investors ownership in the Companys common stock is now approximately 15% of the Companys total outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers In July 2010, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $500 million of AES common stock. The Board authorization permits the Company to repurchase stock through a variety of methods, including open market repurchases and or privately negotiated transactions. The original authorization was set to expire on December 31, 2010, however; in December 2010, the Board authorized an extension of the stock repurchase program. There can be no assurance as to the amount, timing or prices of repurchases, which may vary based on market conditions and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2010, shares of common stock repurchased under this plan totaled 8,382,825 at a total cost of $99 million plus a nominal amount of commissions (average of $11.86 per share including commissions). There was $401 million remaining under the stock repurchase program available for future repurchases at December 31, 2010. 108 Table of Contents The following table presents information regarding purchases made by The AES Corporation of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2010: Repurchase Period Total Numberof SharesPurchased Average PricePaid per Share Total Number of SharesRepurchased as Partof a Publicly AnnouncedRepurchase Plan Dollar Value of MaximumNumber of Shares To BePurchased Under the Plan 10/1/10 10/31/10 6,086,345 $ 12.30 6,086,345 $ 409,713,649 11/1/10 11/30/10 $ $ 409,713,649 12/1/10 12/31/10 755,000 $ 11.89 755,000 $ 400,732,931 Total 6,841,345 $ 12.26 6,841,345 Market Information Our common stock is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol AES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business We are a global power company. We operate two primary lines of business. The first is our Generation business, where we own and or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities, other intermediaries and certain end users. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our Generation and Utilities businesses comprised approximately 45% and 55% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We are also continuing to expand our wind and solar generation businesses. These initiatives are not material contributors to our operating results at this time, but we believe that certain of these initiatives may become material in the future. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10 K. Our Organization and Segments. Our management reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively EMEA), each managed by a regional president. The financial reporting segment structure uses our management reporting structure as its foundation and reflects how we manage the business internally. Based on our application of the segment reporting accounting guidance, which provides certain quantitative thresholds and aggregation criteria, we have concluded that the Company has the following six reportable segments: Latin America Generation; Latin America Utilities; North America Generation; North America Utilities; Europe Generation; Asia Generation. We report the Companys Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation, Wind Generation and Climate Solutions operating segments within Corporate and Other because they do not meet the criteria to allow for aggregation with another operating segment or the quantitative thresholds that would require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. None of these operating segments are currently material to our financial statement presentation of reportable segments, individually or in the aggregate. Corporate and Other also includes corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments and other intercompany charges such as self insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company modified its internal reporting structure to move the management of the Companys generation business in Jordan, Amman East, from Asia to Europe. Accordingly, Amman East is now reported within the Europe Generation segment. All prior periods have been retrospectively restated to reflect this change and conform to current period presentation. Key Drivers of Our Results of Operations. Our Generation and Utilities businesses are distinguished by the nature of their customers, operational differences, cost structure, regulatory environment and risk exposure. As a result, each line of business has slightly different drivers which affect operating results. Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other things, plant reliability and efficiency, power prices, volume, 113 Table of Contents management of fixed and variable operating costs, management of working capital including collection of receivables, and the extent to which our plants have hedged their exposure to currency and commodities such as fuel. For our Generation businesses which sell power under short term contracts or in the spot market, the most crucial factors are the current market price of electricity and the marginal costs of production. Growth in our Generation business is largely tied to securing new PPAs, expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building or acquiring new power plants. Performance drivers for our Utilities businesses include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; management of working capital, including collection of receivables; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive regulatory requirements; and in developing countries, reduction of commercial and technical losses. The operating results of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth and weather conditions in areas in which they operate. In addition to these drivers, as further explained below, the Company also has exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. One of the key factors which affect our Generation business is our ability to enter into contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of fuel used to produce that electricity. Long term contracts are intended to reduce exposure to volatility associated with fuel prices in the market and the price of electricity by fixing the revenue and costs for these businesses. The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. In turn, most of these businesses enter into long term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. While these long term contractual agreements reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel, the predictability of operating results and cash flows vary by business based on the extent to which a facilitys generation capacity and fuel requirements are contracted and the negotiated terms of these agreements. Entering into these contracts exposes us to counterparty credit risk. For further discussion of these risks, see Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. When fuel costs increase, many of our businesses are able to pass these costs on to their customers. Generation businesses with long term contracts in place do this by including fuel pass through or fuel indexing arrangements in their contracts. Utilities businesses can pass costs on to their customers through increases in current or future tariff rates. Therefore, in a rising fuel cost environment, the increased fuel costs for these businesses often result in an increase in revenue to the extent these costs can be passed through (though not necessarily on a one for one basis). Conversely, in a declining fuel cost environment, the decreased fuel costs can result in a decrease in revenue. Increases or decreases in revenue at these businesses that have the ability to pass through costs to the customer have a corresponding impact on cost of sales, to the extent the costs can be passed through, resulting in a limited impact on gross margin, if any. Although these circumstances may not have a large impact on gross margin, they can significantly affect gross margin as a percentage of revenue. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of revenue is a less relevant measure when evaluating our operating performance. To the extent our businesses are unable to pass through fuel cost increases to their customers, gross margin may be adversely affected. Global diversification also helps us mitigate risk. Our presence in mature markets helps mitigate the exposure associated with our businesses in emerging markets. Additionally, our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, water (hydroelectric power), wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. However, to the extent the mix of fuel sources enabling our generation capabilities in any one market is not diversified, the spread in costs of different fuels or the availability of natural resources such as water for hydroelectric power production or wind may also influence the operating performance and the ability of our subsidiaries to compete within that market. For example, in a market where gas prices fall to a low level compared to coal prices, power prices may be set by low gas prices which can affect the profitability of our coal plants in that market. In certain cases, we may attempt to hedge fuel prices to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, we only hedge a 114 Table of Contents portion of our currency and commodity risks, and our businesses are still subject to these risks, as further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. Commodity and power price volatility could continue to impact our financial metrics to the extent this volatility is not hedged. For a discussion of our sensitivities to commodity, currency and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Form 10 K. Due to our global presence, the Company has significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure is primarily associated with the impact of the translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results from their local currency to U.S. Dollars that is required for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, there is foreign currency transaction exposure when an entity enters into transactions, including debt agreements, in currencies other than their functional currency. These risks are further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. During 2010, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a significant impact on our operating results. If the current foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues, our gross margin and other financial metrics could continue to be affected. Another key driver of our results is our ability to bring new businesses into commercial operation successfully. We currently have approximately 1,300 MW of projects under construction in eight countries. Our prospects for improved operating results and cash flows are dependent upon successful completion of these projects on time and within budget. However, as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties, construction is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with site identification, financing, permitting and our ability to meet construction deadlines. Delays or the inability to complete projects and commence commercial operations can result in increased costs, impairment of assets and other challenges involving partners and counterparties to our construction agreements, PPAs and other agreements. Our gross margin is also impacted by the fact that in each country in which we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity, and environmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business. Regulations differ on a country by country basis (and even at the state and local municipality levels) and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country, and affect many aspects of our operations and development projects. Our ability to negotiate tariffs, enter into long term contracts, pass through costs related to capital expenditures and otherwise navigate these regulations can have an impact on our revenue, costs and gross margin. Environmental and land use regulations, including existing and proposed regulation of GHG emissions, could substantially increase our capital expenditures or other compliance costs, which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. For a further discussion of the Regulatory Environment, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments Environmental, included in Item 8. Financial Statements, Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated with Government Regulation and Laws of this Form 10 K. Key Drivers of Results in 2010 In 2010, the Companys gross margin and cash flow from operations increased $531 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, while net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million compared to the prior year. During 2010, our North American generation businesses continued to face challenges associated with relatively lower gas prices and a decline in power prices relative to coal and other fuel. In particular, lower gas and power prices have affected the generation volume and financial results of our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas which are merchant businesses and not subject to PPAs. We expect 115 Table of Contents this trend to continue. In 2010, these challenges were partially mitigated by hedging arrangements. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Impairments below. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Despite these challenges, many of our financial measures have improved when compared to 2009. Gross margin increased due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation caused by a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies in 2010 and better operating performance at certain businesses. For instance, certain of the Companys Latin American businesses experienced continued increases in market demand due to the local economic recovery in Latin America. The Company also benefited from higher demand and favorable market conditions at Masinloc, our generation business in the Philippines. Masinlocs higher availability enabled the Company to benefit from increased contract and spot market sales and favorable market prices in the Philippines. In addition, cash provided by operating activities increased due to the improved operating results at Latin America generation businesses and Masinloc; contributions from the consolidation of Cartagena and the Ballylumford acquisition in 2010; and changes in working capital in Latin America. Despite the increase in gross margin in 2010, net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased primarily from the impact of long lived asset impairments recognized related to four businesses: Eastern Energy in New York, Southland in California, Tisza II in Hungary and Deepwater in Texas. These were partially offset by gains from the sale of our discontinued businesses in Oman and Qatar and a decrease in goodwill impairment charges. In 2011, we expect to face continued challenges in our business, including the trends in North America described above. In addition, the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and commodity prices on our operations may continue into 2011. In 2011, the components of the tariff reset in Brazil and its potential impact on our Brazilian utilities are uncertain at this time and we expect continued challenges in our merchant businesses such as those in the U.S., Hungary and Northern Ireland. However, management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses and growth from new businesses acquired, that commenced operations in 2010 or are expected to commence operations in 2011, may lessen or offset the impact of these challenges described above, as they did in 2010. However, if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described above or elsewhere in this section impact us more than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our gross margin and net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In addition, we do not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. Such cash flows may be influenced by the operating challenges presented above and will also not include the cash flows from operations which were sold in 2010 or the increases experienced from the cash flows provided by the initial consolidation of Cartagena, the acquisition of Ballylumford and several working capital transactions at our Latin American utilities in 2010 as discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity. The following briefly describes the key changes in our reported revenue, gross margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, Adjusted Earnings per Share (a non GAAP measure) and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Results of Operations and Segment Analysis discussion within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. 116 Table of Contents Performance Highlights Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 Gross Margin $ 3,964 $ 3,433 $ 3,568 Net Income Attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share from Continuing Operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (a non GAAP measure)(1) $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 3,510 $ 2,202 $ 2,160 (1) See reconciliation and definition below under Non GAAP Measure. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue increased $2.7 billion, or 19%, to $16.6 billion in 2010 compared with $14.0 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $805 million; increased volume and rates at our Brazilian utilities attributable to increased demand due to the recovery of the local economy and the favorable impact of the June 2009 tariff reset; the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010; the favorable impact of rates at our generation businesses in Argentina; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; higher demand at Gener in Chile; the impact of the Companys new business in Northern Ireland, acquired in August 2010; and higher demand and rates at Indianapolis Power and Light. Gross margin increased $531 million, or 15%, to $4.0 billion in 2010 compared with $3.4 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $219 million; an increase in demand at our generation and utilities businesses in Latin America; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; and the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs in Latin America, largely driven by bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil in 2009 that did not recur; and lower rates at our generation businesses in New York. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million to $9 million in 2010, compared to $658 million in 2009. Key drivers of the decrease included: Impairment losses in New York related to our Eastern Energy facilities, in California related to our Southland (Huntington Beach) generation facility, in Hungary related to our Tisza II generation facility and in Texas related to our Deepwater facility; 117 Table of Contents A decrease in gain on sale of investments due to the sale of our businesses in Northern Kazakhstan which occurred in 2009; and A decrease in other income due to the reduction in interest and penalties in 2009 associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the Programa de Recuperacao Fiscal (REFIS) program and a favorable court decision in 2009 enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by: The gain on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of Barka which occurred in August 2010; An increase in net equity in earnings of affiliates partially offset by income tax expense related to the sale of the Companys indirect investment in Companhia Energ&eacute;tica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Lower impairment expenses related to a goodwill impairment of our business in Kilroot that occurred in 2009; Lower income tax expense due to 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries; and An increase in gross margin as described above. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion, or 59%, to $3.5 billion in 2010 compared with $2.2 billion in 2009. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $837 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased tax payments in 2009 associated with a tax amnesty program of $326 million, higher working capital requirements during 2009 related to payments on the settlement of swap agreements of $65 million and in 2010, a $50 million decrease in employer contributions to pension plans and lower payments for contingencies; an increase of $215 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to the higher gross margin in 2010 combined with improved working capital mainly as a result of higher collections of value added taxes and accounts receivable; an increase of $99 million at Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher gross margin; and an increase of $58 million as a result of our consolidation of Cartagena in 2010 and the acquisition of Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $136 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations of businesses sold in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of businesses sold was $33 million and will not recur in 2011. In 2010 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities at our Latin American Utilities businesses included several items such as the tax amnesty program and settlement of swap agreements, as described above, that are not expected to recur. In addition, 2010 net cash provided by operating activities benefited from the one time cash savings related to the utilization of tax credits received as a result of the REFIS program. As such, the Company does not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. 118 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue decreased $1.2 billion, or 8%, to $14.0 billion in 2009 compared with $15.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $997 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; decreases in volume at Uruguaiana due to the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold, as well as in New York and Hungary and lower dispatch in Northern Ireland due to unfavorable gas prices compared to coal; the impact of lower spot and contract energy prices at our generation business in Chile; and lower energy prices and volume at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase in tariff rates at our utilities businesses in Latin America primarily reflecting the recovery of energy purchases that were passed through to our customers. Gross margin decreased $135 million, or 4%, to $3.4 billion in 2009 compared with $3.6 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $218 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; lower energy prices and higher purchased energy costs at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic and Argentina; increased pension costs in Brazil and the U.S.; and lower volume in New York due to lower spot market rates. These decreases were partially offset by: improved operating performance at our generation businesses in Chile and the Philippines; higher tariffs in Brazil and El Salvador; and bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $576 million to $658 million in 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: a gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Northern Kazakhstan partially offset by a performance incentive bonus recognized in 2009 for management services provided to these subsidiaries and a settlement upon termination of the management agreement in 2009; the reduction in gross margin in 2009 as described above; and higher impairment expenses in 2009 as a result of an impairment of goodwill at Kilroot in Northern Ireland, and an impairment recognized on our assets in Pakistan which is reflected in discontinued operations, offset by a decline in long lived asset impairment compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by: a reduction in foreign currency transaction losses on net monetary position as a result of reduced losses at our businesses in Chile and the Philippines; a reduction in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates and debt balances in Brazil and favorable foreign currency translation; and lower income tax expenses driven in part by lower pre tax income and a decrease in the effective tax rate from 29% in 2008 to 26% in 2009 due, in part, to tax benefits recorded in 2009 upon the release of 119 Table of Contents valuation allowances at U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recognized in Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. In 2008, the $905 million gain recognized on the sale of our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses had a significant impact on net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In 2009, the Company recognized a performance incentive bonus of $80 million in the first quarter for management services provided to these sold businesses, reflected as other income. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized an additional gain on the sale of the businesses of $98.5 million upon the termination of the management agreement. While the Company engages in the sale of assets and businesses from time to time, the gain or loss recognized in any such sale will depend on a number of factors related to the asset or business that may be sold. Therefore, the Company does not believe that the decline in net income between 2008 and 2009 represents a trend. All of the amounts related to our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses were reported in continuing operations and will not recur in 2010 or future years. Net cash from operating activities increased $42 million, or 2%, to $2.2 billion in 2009 compared with $2.2 billion in 2008. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $238 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to improved working capital management; an increase of $148 million at our Asia Generation businesses due to improved working capital management and improved gross margin; and an increase of $115 million at our Europe Generation businesses primarily due to the collection of the $80 million Kazakhstan management performance incentive bonus in the first quarter 2009. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $391 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased working capital requirements, including the payment of the settlement of a swap agreement, increased tax payments associated with a tax amnesty program and increased payments related to the settlement of contingencies and energy purchases, partially offset by increased operating results; and a decrease of $77 million at our North America Generation businesses, primarily due to reduced operating results. Non GAAP Measure We define adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) mark to market amounts related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) significant gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) significant losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. AES believes that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Companys internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to mark to market gains or losses related to derivative transactions, currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.11 per share. For purposes of measuring loss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be antidilutive. However, for purposes of computing Adjusted 120 Table of Contents EPS (a non GAAP measure), the Company has included the impact of dilutive common stock equivalents as the inclusion of the defined adjustments result in income for Adjusted EPS. The table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in GAAP diluted earnings per share to the weighted average shares used in calculating the non GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Reconciliation of Denominator used for Adjusted Earnings Per Share Loss Shares $ per Share GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Loss from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders $ (86 ) 769 $ (0.11 ) EFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES Stock options 2 Restricted stock units 3 NON GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE $ (86 ) 774 $ (0.11 ) Year Ended December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share 2010 2009 2008 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Derivative mark to market (gains) losses(1) (0.01 ) 0.02 0.05 Currency transaction (gains) losses(2) (0.04 ) (0.04 ) 0.17 Disposition/acquisition (gains) losses (3) (0.19 )(4) (1.27 )(5) Impairment losses 1.07 (6) 0.21 (7) 0.13 (8) Debt retirement (gains) losses 0.03 (9) 0.25 (10) Adjusted earnings per share $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 (1) Derivative mark to market (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Debt retirement (gains) losses are net of an income tax benefit of $0.04 per share in 2008. Managements Priorities Management continues to focus on the following priorities: Execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy including funds received in 2010 from asset and equity sales: investing in value accretive projects; delevering to increase financial flexibility, reduce risk and to create future borrowing capacity; and executing its stock repurchase program; from July through December 2010 we have repurchased a total of $99 million, or approximately 8.4 million shares of AES common stock, at an average price per share of $11.86, including commissions. Improvement of operations in the existing portfolio; Achieve cost savings through the alignment of overhead costs with business requirements, systems automation and optimal allocation of business development spending; Strategic portfolio management of existing projects including restructuring and potential sales of certain North American generation subsidiaries; Completion of an approximately 1,300 MW active construction program on time and within budget; Achieving commercial operation at Maritza in Bulgaria. At the end of 2010, the Company experienced certain commissioning delays, as further described in Key Trends and Uncertainties Development below; and 122 Table of Contents Integration of new projects. During 2010, the following projects were acquired or commenced commercial operations: Project Location Fuel GrossMW AES Equity Interest(Percent, Rounded) Ballylumford United Kingdom Gas 1,246 100 % JHRH(1) China Hydro 379 35 % Nueva Ventanas Chile Coal 272 71 % St. Nikola Bulgaria Wind 156 89 % Guacolda 4(2) Chile Coal 152 35 % Dong Qi(3) China Wind 49 49 % Huanghua II(3) China Wind 49 49 % St. Patrick France Wind 35 100 % North Rhins Scotland Wind 22 100 % Kepezkaya Turkey Hydro 28 51 % Damlapinar(4) Turkey Hydro 16 51 % (1) Jianghe Rural Electrification Development Co.

Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Some of these challenges are also described above in Key Drivers of Results in 2010. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. Development. During the past year, the Company has successfully acquired and completed construction of a number of projects, totaling approximately 2,404 MW, including the acquisition of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom and completion of construction of a number of projects in Europe, Chile and China. However, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties of this Form 10 K, our development projects are subject to uncertainties. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not yet begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, we believe that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this time frame. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results or financial position. Global Economic Conditions. During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Although the economic conditions in several of these countries have improved in recent months, our businesses could be impacted in the event these recent trends do not continue. 123 Table of Contents Our business or results of operations could be impacted if our subsidiaries are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all, are unable to raise funds through the sale of assets or are otherwise unable to finance or refinance their activities. The Company could also be adversely affected if capital market disruptions result in increased borrowing costs (including with respect to interest payments on the Companys or our subsidiaries variable rate debt) or if commodity prices affect the profitability of our plants or their ability to continue operations. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if general economic or political conditions in the markets where our subsidiaries operate deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the availability and or an increase in the cost of capital, or if the value of our assets remain depressed or decline further. Any of the foregoing events or a combination thereof could have a material impact on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, financial covenants, and or its credit rating. Our subsidiaries are subject to credit risk, which includes risk related to the ability of counterparties (such as parties to our PPAs, fuel supply agreements, hedging agreements and other contractual arrangements) to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price or to satisfy their financial or other contractual obligations. The Company has not suffered any material effects related to its counterparties during 2010. However, if macroeconomic conditions impact our counterparties, they may be unable to meet their commitments which could result in the loss of favorable contractual positions, which could have a material impact on our business. In addition, during the past year, certain European countries have faced a sovereign debt crisis and it is possible that other nations could be affected. This crisis has resulted in an increased risk of default by governments and the implementation of austerity measures in countries. If the crisis continues, worsens, or spreads, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company. Our businesses may be impacted if they are unable to access the capital markets, face increased taxes or labor costs, or if governments fail to fulfill their obligations to us or adopt austerity measures which adversely impact our projects. In addition, as noted in the Risk Factor entitled, Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges, our renewables businesses are dependent on favorable regulatory incentives, including subsidies, which are provided by sovereign governments. If these subsidies or other incentives are reduced or repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, in whole or in part, this could impact the ability of the affected businesses to continue to grow their operations. For example, the Spanish government recently issued a decree which limits the feed in tariff and number of photovoltaic hours eligible for the tariff, which could adversely impact AES Solar in Spain. For further information on the decree see Item 1. Regulatory Spain of this Form 10 K. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries. For further information on the importance of long term contracts and our counterparty credit risk, see the Risk Factor from this Form 10 K titled, We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. As a result of any of the foregoing events, we may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. The Companys investment in AES Solar, whose primary operations are in Europe, at December 31, 2010 was $312 million. For a discussion of the risks associated with commodity prices, see We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. It is also possible that commodity or power price volatility could continue to impact our financial results. As noted in Key Drivers of Results in 2010, and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk of this Form 10 K, the Companys North American businesses continue to face pressure as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place, but purchase 124 Table of Contents fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. If these conditions continue or worsen, these businesses may need to restructure their obligations or seek additional funding (including from the Parent) or face the possibility that they may be unable to meet their obligations and continue operations. Presently, Eastern Energy, Deepwater and Thames are seeking to restructure their financial obligations and or place certain of their plants in protective layup status to mitigate operating risks caused by high fuel costs and other competitive pressures. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. The Company presently manages its commodity risk with hedging activities to mitigate earnings volatility. However, at present in North America, dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present an opportunity to engage in additional hedging activity for 2011. As a result, there are hedging arrangements in place for only a relatively small portion of 2011. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. Specifically, the operating results of the Companys Eastern Energy generation business in New York could be adversely impacted by continued higher coal prices relative to electricity prices if hedging continues to be uneconomic. If global economic conditions worsen, it could also affect the rates we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our rates based on prevailing market conditions as PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual rate or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. Impairments. Long lived assets. The global economic conditions and other adverse factors discussed above heighten the risk of a significant asset impairment. Examples of conditions that could be indicative of impairment which would require us to evaluate the recovery of a long lived asset or asset group include: current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset group; a significant adverse change in legal factors, including changes in environmental or other regulations or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used or in its physical condition. As further described in Item 1. Regulatory Matters United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR) had the right to require the termination of the long term PPAs under which Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom, supplies electricity to NIE Energy as early as 2010. One of the conditions to the early termination was 180 days notice, which was provided to Kilroot on April 30, 2010. At March 31, 2010, management evaluated Kilroots long lived assets for potential impairment assuming the early termination of the PPA and concluded that no impairment existed at that time. On October 28, 2010, Kilroot received final notice from NIAUR directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the PPA effective November 1, 2010. Kilroot may not be able to replace the contract on competitive terms and, upon cancellation of the PPA effective November 1, 2010, became a merchant plant. It will operate under the gross mandatory pool of the SEM in Northern Ireland. There have been no additional impairment indicators since March 31, 2010. AES Eastern Energy (AEE) operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. 125 Table of Contents The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated an impairment evaluation of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW petroleum coke (pet coke) fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and a recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 126 Table of Contents 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time, since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and what form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations. This was considered as an impairment indicator for the long lived asset groups. The recoverability test of the long lived asset groups indicated that the carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group exceeded its fair value by $200 million which was recognized as an impairment expense. The carrying amounts of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach long lived asset groups were determined to be recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis at September 30, 2010 and no impairment was necessary. During the third quarter of 2010, we also recognized impairment on the long lived assets at our Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. Tisza II operates under an annual contract with an off taker. In the third quarter of 2010, when Tisza II began the negotiation of its 2011 contract, future undiscounted cash flows of the plant were no longer expected to recover the long lived assets groups carrying amount due to prevailing market rates, higher generation costs and lower demand expectations. Accordingly, the Company measured the fair value of the long lived asset group and recorded an impairment expense of $85 million, representing the excess of carrying amount over the fair value at September 30, 2010. Goodwill. The Company seeks business acquisitions as one of its growth strategies. We have achieved significant growth in the past as a result of several business acquisitions, which also resulted in the recognition of goodwill. As noted in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, there is always a risk that Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. The benefits of goodwill are typically realized through the future operating results of an acquired business. Management believes that the recoverability of goodwill is positively correlated with the economic environments in which our acquired businesses operate and a severe economic downturn could negatively impact the recoverability of goodwill. Also, the evolving environmental regulations, including GHG regulations, around the globe continue to increase the operating costs of our generation businesses. In extreme situations, the environmental regulations could even make a once profitable business uneconomical. In addition, most of our generation businesses have a finite life and as the acquired businesses reach the end of their finite lives, the carrying amount of goodwill is gradually recovered through their periodic operating results. The accounting guidance, however, prohibits the systematic amortization of goodwill and rather requires an annual impairment evaluation. Thus, as some of our acquired businesses approach the end of their finite lives, they may incur goodwill impairment charges even if there are no discrete adverse changes in the economic environment. As noted in Long lived assets above, adverse market conditions at Deepwater were also considered an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. Accordingly, in the second and third quarters of 2010, interim 127 Table of Contents goodwill impairment evaluations were performed at the Deepwater reporting unit level. The reporting unit passed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation in the second quarter and no impairment was recognized. In the third quarter, however, the reporting unit failed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation. Upon measurement of impairment loss in Step 2, the entire $18 million goodwill balance was considered impaired and recognized as goodwill impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation and did not have any reporting units that were considered at risk. A reporting unit is considered at risk when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. While there were no potential impairment indicators that could result in the recognition of goodwill impairment for any of these reporting units, it is possible we may incur goodwill impairment on these reporting units in future years if any of the following events occur: a significant adverse change in business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a sale of assets at less than carrying amount, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, an acquisition not performing as expected, changing environmental regulations that significantly increase the cost of doing business, or a business reaches the end of its finite life. The likelihood of the occurrence of these events may increase because of the challenging global macroeconomic conditions. Regulatory Environment. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter and mercury. For a description of material regulations faced by the Company, see Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A.

These increases were partially offset by: lower volume sold at Uruguaiana of $53 million as a result of renegotiation of its power sales agreements; lower volume due to unfavorable hydrology in Colombia and Argentina of $41 million; lower contract prices at Gener of $32 million; and lower contract prices on PPAs indexed to international coal prices in the Dominican Republic of $22 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $106 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $34 million, or 3%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher spot prices in Argentina of $69 million; higher volume and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic of $55 million; higher contract prices of $33 million in Colombia; the positive impact of $28 million resulting from the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana, as mentioned above; and higher volume of $23 million in Panama. These increases were partially offset by: higher fuel and purchased energy prices at Gener of $48 million; the net effect of lower PPA prices and higher fuel costs in the Dominican Republic of $38 million; 130 Table of Contents the impact of a reversal of bad debt expense during the first quarter of 2009 of $36 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of one of its power sales agreements; and higher fixed costs of $30 million at Gener primarily due to higher employee costs, increased maintenance expenses and costs incurred due to construction delays at Campiche. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 17% while gross margin increased 10%, primarily due to higher spot purchases and fuel prices at Gener and the reversal of bad debt expense as a result of the renegotiation of one of the power sales agreements at Uruguaiana in the first quarter of 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $181 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $636 million, or 14%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower spot and contract prices of $295 million at Gener; lower volume of $227 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold; and lower energy prices and volume of $174 million in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: and increase of $100 million due to fewer outages at Gener and in Argentina in 2009; and higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $94 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $53 million, or 4%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;; fewer outages of $60 million at Gener and in Argentina; lower diesel consumption, partially offset by higher energy purchases and higher gas consumption, at Gener of $47 million; lower volume of energy purchased at Uruguaiana of $44 million as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements; and the favorable impact of $28 million of a decrease in bad debt expense at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of lower energy prices of $75 million in the Dominican Republic; lower volume and energy prices of $66 million in Argentina; higher purchased energy prices of $48 million at Uruguaiana; and lower spot sales of $48 million at Panama. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 18% while gross margin decreased 3%, primarily due to reduced energy purchases, fewer outages and lower bad debt expense. 131 Table of Contents Latin America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in Latin America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Latin America Utilities Revenue $ 7,222 $ 6,092 $ 5,907 19 % 3 % Gross Margin $ 1,072 $ 918 $ 886 17 % 4 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $697 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2010 increased $433 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $316 million, primarily in Brazil, due to increased market demand; and higher tariffs of $114 million primarily related to the July 2009 tariff reset in Brazil partially offset by the unfavorable impact on rates at Eletropaulo in Brazil of a cumulative adjustment to regulatory liabilities and higher energy prices across our Latin America utility businesses associated with energy purchases passed through to customers of $97 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $107 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $47 million, or 5%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $163 million, primarily in Brazil, due to the increased market demand; and lower contingencies of $142 million in Eletropaulo primarily related to labor contingencies which included a one time reversal, reflecting an agreement with Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o CESP, the pension plan administrator, of $51 million associated with claims for past benefit obligations which will now be accounted for as a component of the pension plan. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $238 million primarily due to the recovery in 2009 of a municipality receivable previously written off in Brazil and higher salaries and other employee related costs, provisions for commercial losses, regulatory penalties and maintenance costs; and $28 million related to the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $442 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2009 increased $627 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $560 million reflecting the recovery of energy purchases of $453 million that were passed through to customers at our utilities in Brazil and El Salvador; and higher volume in Brazil of $62 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $62 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2009 increased $94 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $107 million in El Salvador and Brazil; a $64 million recovery of a municipality receivable previously written off; 132 Table of Contents a non recurring PIS/COFINS fine in 2008 of $33 million; and higher volume of $32 million across the region. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of higher fixed costs of $120 million mainly related to pension expense, labor contingencies and maintenance costs in Brazil. North America Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Generation Revenue $ 1,972 $ 1,940 $ 2,234 2 % 13 % Gross Margin $ 435 $ 477 $ 660 9 % 28 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $19 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $13 million, or 1%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased rates, volume and an availability bonus at TEG/TEP in Mexico of $41 million; higher volume, primarily due to fewer outages and higher rates, of $22 million at Merida in Mexico; higher volume of $19 million at Warrior Run in Maryland due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. These increases were partially offset by: a net decrease of $50 million in New York due to lower rates partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a net decrease of $18 million at Deepwater in Texas primarily due to lower volume; and a net decrease of $14 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3 million, generation gross margin for 2010 decreased $45 million, or 9%, from 2009 primarily due to: a net decrease of $94 million in New York due to lower rates and higher coal prices partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a decrease of $16 million at Deepwater due to lower volume and rates; a net decrease of $11 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage; a decrease of $9 million in Hawaii due to an unfavorable impact of mark to market derivatives; and a decrease of $7 million in Puerto Rico due to higher fixed costs. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase of $39 million in New York primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of lower contract and maintenance costs, and other employee related costs; 133 Table of Contents a net increase of $26 million at TEG/TEP due to a current year availability bonus and fewer outages partially offset by higher fuel prices; higher volume of $14 million at Warrior Run due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 2% while gross margin decreased 9%, primarily due to the change in rates in New York having a greater impact on gross margin than revenue. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $44 million, primarily in Mexico, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $250 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $107 million in New York due to a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a decrease of $80 million due to a reduction in natural gas prices at Merida; increased outages of $22 million, $21 million and $17 million at Warrior Run, TEG/TEP and New York, respectively; lower rates of $20 million at Deepwater; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives in New York of $11 million; and the unfavorable impact in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $9 million, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $174 million, or 26%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $72 million in New York driven by a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a $29 million unfavorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments on coal supply contracts in Hawaii as a result of a gain of $22 million in 2008 compared to a loss of $7 million in 2009; an increase in outages of $22 million and $6 million at Warrior Run and in New York, respectively; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives of $11 million and higher emission allowance purchases of $13 million in New York; and the unfavorable impact of $9 million in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 13% while gross margin decreased 28%, primarily due to the increase in coal prices in New York and the unfavorable impact of derivatives in 2009 in Hawaii that had no corresponding impact on revenue. 134 Table of Contents North America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Utilities Revenue $ 1,145 $ 1,068 $ 1,079 7 % 1 % Gross Margin $ 249 $ 239 $ 261 4 % 8 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Utilities revenue for 2010 increased $77 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail demand of $64 million as a result of warmer weather and higher fuel adjustment charges; and increased wholesale revenue of $11 million primarily due to higher prices. Utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $10 million, or 4%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail margin of $20 million due to increased demand; lower pension expense of $12 million; and lower emission allowance expense of $5 million. These increases were partially offset by: increased maintenance expenses of $16 million due to the timing of major generating unit overhauls; and increased fixed costs of $14 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 7% while gross margin increased 4%, primarily due to increased fuel and maintenance costs. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Utilities revenue for 2009 decreased $11 million, or 1%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower retail volume of $31 million due primarily to milder weather and the economic recession; and decreased wholesale revenue of $7 million driven by lower market prices. These decreases were partially offset by: $32 million of voluntary credits IPL provided to retail customers in 2008. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters North America of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these credits. Utilities gross margin for 2009 decreased $22 million, or 8%, from 2008 primarily due to: decreased wholesale margin of $16 million due to unfavorable prices; and increased pension expense of $25 million largely due to the decline in market value of IPLs pension assets during 2008. 135 Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by: increased retail margin of $15 million, primarily due to the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, partially offset by lower retail sales volumes in 2009; and decreased property tax expense of $5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 1% while gross margin decreased 8%, primarily due to the $25 million increase in pension expense and the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, both of which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. Europe Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Europe for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Europe Generation Revenue $ 1,362 $ 820 $ 1,143 66 % 28 % Gross Margin $ 268 $ 212 $ 273 26 % 22 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $41 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $583 million, or 71%, from 2009 primarily due to: $409 million from the adoption of new accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) which resulted in the consolidation of Cartagena in Spain, a generation business previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting; $117 million from the operations of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom, which was acquired in August 2010; $16 million from a full year of combined cycle operations at our Amman East plant in Jordan, which was single cycle until August 2009; higher tariffs of $16 million at Altai in Kazakhstan; higher volume of $15 million at Kilroot in the United Kingdom largely driven by coal pass through and increased demand, partially offset by lower capacity revenue due to the termination of the long term PPA and related supplementary agreements. These increases were partially offset by: lower volume and sales of emissions allowances in Hungary of $16 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $1 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $57 million, or 27%, from 2009 primarily due to: $62 million from the consolidation of Cartagena as discussed above; higher tariffs and lower fixed costs at Altai of $29 million; and $13 million from the operations of Ballylumford since its acquisition. 136 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: lower gross margin of $28 million primarily from the termination of the long term PPA at Kilroot; and lower gross margin of $20 million in Hungary primarily attributable to higher fuel costs that could not be passed through and lower sales of emission allowances. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 66% while gross margin increased 26%, primarily due to the consolidation of Cartagena and acquisition of Ballylumford that have a larger positive impact on revenue than gross margin, and the positive impact of higher energy revenue at Kilroot, which as a pass through had no corresponding impact on gross margin. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $146 million, driven mainly by Kilroot, Hungary and Kazakhstan, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $177 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower revenue of $101 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower volume of $81 million in Hungary due to the combined impact of the cancellation of one of our PPAs and reduced demand; and lower volume of $67 million at Kilroot, a coal fired plant, mainly driven by lower dispatch due to favorable gas prices compared to coal. These decreases were partially offset by: the benefit of new business of $50 million at Amman East, which commenced single cycle operations in July 2008; and higher rates of $15 million in Kazakhstan. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $35 million, driven mainly by Kilroot and Kazakhstan, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $26 million, or 10%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower gross margin of $41 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower demand of $12 million in Hungary; and an overall increase of $22 million in fixed costs across the region. These decreases were partially offset by: higher capacity revenue at Kilroot; higher energy prices in Kazakhstan; and the benefit of new business at Amman East. Asia Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Asia for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Asia Generation Revenue $ 618 $ 375 $ 345 65 % 9 % Gross Margin $ 240 $ 93 $ (10 ) 158 % 1030 % 137 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $28 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $215 million, or 57%, from 2009 primarily due to: favorable generation rates and volume of $210 million at Masinloc in the Philippines as a result of increased market demand and improved plant availability subsequent to the completion of its overhaul at the beginning of 2010; and higher demand from both new and existing contract and spot customers as a result of lower supply shortages in the Philippines power market due to a strong energy growth rate. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $13 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $134 million, or 144%, from 2009 primarily due to a combination of higher availability attributable to improved plant operations, higher market demand and favorable spot prices at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 65% while gross margin increased 158%, primarily due to the positive influence on gross margin due to favorable spot rates and operational efficiencies resulting from the Masinloc plant overhauls in late 2009 and early 2010, which led to higher availability and allowed for more efficient operations that have materially improved the operating results for 2010 as compared to 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $23 million, primarily in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, generation revenue for 2009 increased $53 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: the benefit of $46 million of our new business Masinloc, which was acquired in April 2008; increased revenue of $70 million in 2009 at Masinloc due to improved rates and volume as a result of improved availability and new customer contracts; and $18 million from a one time favorable energy sales settlement at Masinloc. These increases were partially offset by: the decrease in revenue of $71 million at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka primarily due to a decline in fuel costs which are largely passed through to the customer and higher outages in 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by higher capacity revenue. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $6 million, primarily in the Philippines, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $109 million, or 1,090%, from 2008 primarily due to: the impact of our new business at Masinloc of $23 million; a $91 million increase at Masinloc due to higher contract sales, where margins are more favorable than spot sales, lower fuel prices, improved availability and the favorable energy sales settlement described above; and higher capacity revenue at Kelanitissa of $10 million. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $20 million at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue increased 9% while gross margin increased 1,030%, primarily due to higher contract margins at Masinloc as a result of improved operations, availability and lower fuel prices, as well as the larger relative impact on gross margin from the one time favorable energy sales settlement described above. 138 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Corporate and other includes the net operating results from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, AES Wind Generation and renewables projects which are immaterial for the purposes of separate segment disclosure.

The increase was primarily due to: higher volume at our utility businesses in Ukraine driven by an overall increase in market demand; higher volume and utility tariffs at Sonel in Cameroon driven by an increase in market demand; and incremental revenue from new wind generation projects that commenced operations during the year and an overall volume increase across our wind businesses. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $8 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $77 million for 2010, or 66% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: an increase in gross margin from our new wind generation projects and higher volume, as discussed above; and an increase in volume at Dibamba, our generation business, in Cameroon. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs at Sonel. 139 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $162 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other revenue increased $20 million for 2009, or 2%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: higher tariffs in Ukraine of $27 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $12 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $67 million for 2009, or 108%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: a decrease in fixed costs across the Africa region. The increase was partially offset by: higher fuel consumption attributable to lower hydrology at Sonel. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense includes those expenses related to corporate and region staff functions and or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems, and development costs. General and administrative expenses increased $53 million, or 16%, to $392 million in 2010 from 2009. The increase is primarily related to business development costs associated with increased development efforts, primarily in Europe, Turkey and India. General and administrative expenses decreased $29 million, or 8%, to $339 million in 2009 from 2008. The decrease is primarily related to 2008 professional fees associated with remediation efforts and a reduction in business development costs. The favorable variance is partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the worldwide implementation of SAP. Interest expense Interest expense increased $41 million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to interest expense at Cartagena which is now a consolidated entity, higher interest rates at Tiet&ecirc;, increased debt principal at Eletropaulo and interest being expensed related to St. Nikola, our wind project in Bulgaria, due to commencement of operations in 2010. These increases were partially offset by reduced debt principal at the Parent Company. Interest expense decreased $285 million, or 16%, to $1.5 billion in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates globally due to economic conditions and inflationary adjustments to the market price index in Brazil. In addition, interest expense decreased as a result of favorable foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil and lower interest expenses associated with decreased debt balances at Eletropaulo. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense at Masinloc in the Philippines which was acquired in April 2008, and interest expense at Infovias in Brazil where a fee on a non exercised credit line was written off. Interest income Interest income increased $63 million, or 18%, to $411 million in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to a higher average balance in short term investments at Eletropaulo and the favorable impact of 140 Table of Contents foreign currency translation in Brazil as well as the settlement of a dispute related to inflation adjustments for energy sales at Tiet&ecirc;. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest income from a loan to a wind development project in Brazil which was repaid in June 2010. Interest income decreased $171 million, or 33%, to $348 million in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances in Brazil, unfavorable foreign currency translation in Brazil, the impact of decreased interest rates and inflationary adjustments on accounts receivable in 2008 at Gener in Chile and a decreased cash balance at the Parent Company. Other income Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Gain on extinguishment of tax and other liabilities $ 65 $ 168 $ 199 Tax credit settlement 129 Performance incentive fee 80 Insurance proceeds 40 Gain on sale of assets 12 14 34 Other 31 74 102 Total other income $ 108 $ 465 $ 375 Other income of $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to the extinguishment of a swap liability owed by two of our Brazilian subsidiaries, resulting in the recognition of a $62 million gain. The net impact to the Company after taxes and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Other income also included a gain on sale of assets at Eletropaulo. Other income of $465 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $165 million from the reduction in interest and penalties associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the REFIS program and a $129 million gain related to a favorable court decision enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. The net impact to the Company after income taxes and noncontrolling interests for these items was $44 million. In addition, the Company recognized income in 2009 of $80 million from a performance incentive bonus for management services provided to Ekibastuz and Maikuben in 2008. The management agreement was related to the sale of these businesses in Kazakhstan in May 2008; see further discussion of this transaction in Note 22 Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Other income of $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included gains on the extinguishment of a gross receipts tax liability and a legal contingency at Eletropaulo of $117 million and $75 million, respectively, $32 million of cash proceeds related to a favorable legal settlement at Southland in California, $29 million of insurance recoveries for damaged turbines at Uruguaiana, $23 million of gains associated with a sale of land at Eletropaulo and sales of turbines at Itabo, and compensation of $18 million for the impairment associated with the settlement agreement to shut down Hefei. 141 Table of Contents Other expense Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Loss on sale and disposal of assets $ 84 $ 42 $ 34 Gener gas settlement 72 Loss on extinguishment of debt 37 70 AES Wind transaction costs 22 Other 24 69 57 Total other expense $ 239 $ 111 $ 161 Other expense of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $72 million for a settlement agreement of gas transportation contracts at Gener. There were also previously capitalized transaction costs of $22 million that were incurred in connection with the preparation for the sale of a noncontrolling interest in our Wind Generation business which were written off upon the expiration of the letter of intent in June 2010. In addition, there were losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo, Panama, and Gener, an $18 million loss on debt extinguishment at Andres and Itabo and a $15 million loss at the Parent Company from the retirement of senior notes. Other expense of $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $13 million loss recognized when three of our businesses in the Dominican Republic received $110 million par value bonds issued by the Dominican Republic government to settle existing accounts receivable for the same amount from the government owned distribution companies. The loss represented an adjustment to reflect the fair value of the bonds on the date received. Other expense also included losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo and Andres and contingencies at our businesses in Kazakhstan and Alicura in Argentina. Other expense of $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $69 million of losses on the retirement of debt at the Parent Company in connection with the refinancing in June 2008 and IPALCO associated with a $375 million refinancing in April 2008 and losses on disposal of assets primarily at Eletropaulo. Goodwill Impairment In 2010, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2010, Deepwater, our pet coke fired merchant generation facility in Texas, determined that there was an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. This determination was primarily based on managements decision not to operate the plant for more than 30 days in the third quarter of 2010, current operating and cash flow losses, and forecasted operating and cash flow losses for the remainder of 2010 through 2014 as a result of declining trends in energy pricing curves and increasing pet coke prices. As a result, Deepwater recognized a goodwill impairment of $18 million. Deepwater is reported in the North America Generation segment. In 2009, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $122 million. This was a result of impairment at certain of our businesses in the United Kingdom and Ukraine as a result of the Companys annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of October 1. The most significant goodwill impairment was at Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom. Factors contributing to the recognition of impairment included: reduced profit expectations based on latest estimates of future commodity prices and reduced expectations on the recovery of cash flows on the existing plant following the Companys decision to forgo capital expenditures to meet emission allowance requirements taking effect in 2024. The fair value of the Companys reporting units are inherently sensitive to the assumptions underlying the estimates of fair value. Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Fair Value, Goodwill and Intangibles in Item 8 of this Form 10 K provides a 142 Table of Contents more detailed discussion of those assumptions. As discussed in Key Trends and Uncertainties, in the future, the fair values of the Companys reporting units might decline as a result of adverse changes in their operating environments or the businesses reaching the end of their finite lives, which could require the Company to record additional goodwill impairment charges. The Company did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2008. Asset Impairment Expense As discussed in Note 19 Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, asset impairment expense for the year 2010 was $1,221 million and consisted primarily of the following: Eastern Energy AEE operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated a recoverability test of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Southland In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and the exact form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process 143 Table of Contents through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations and the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. The Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment. The asset group was determined to be at the individual plant level and based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined that the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the Huntington Beach asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying value of the Huntington Beach plant of $288 million exceeded the fair value of $88 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $200 million. The undiscounted cash flows of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach generation facilities exceeded their respective carrying values and resulted in no impairment. Huntington Beach is reported in the North America Generation reportable segment. Tisza II During the third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into annual negotiations with the offtaker of its Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. As a result of these preliminary negotiations, as well as the further deterioration of the economic environment in Hungary, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. Thus, the Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and determined that based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount of the Tisza II asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The carrying value of the Tisza II asset group of $160 million exceeded the fair value of $75 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $85 million. Tisza II is reported in the Europe Generation reportable segment. Deepwater In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW pet coke fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, 144 Table of Contents all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Asset impairment expense for the year 2009 was $25 million. In 2009, the Company recognized a pre tax long lived asset impairment charge of $11 million related to the Companys Piabanha hydro project in Brazil. The Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows and abandoned the project. Asset impairment expense for the year 2008 was $175 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, the Company reviewed and prioritized projects in the development pipeline. From this review, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows for certain projects. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $75 million ($34 million, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes) related to two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non power development project at one of our facilities in North America. During 2008, the Company recognized additional impairment charges of $36 million related to long lived assets at Uruguaiana. The impairment was triggered by a combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy in 2007 that continued in 2008. Following an initial impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, further charges were incurred in 2008 due to fixed asset purchase agreements in place. During the first half of 2008, the Company withdrew from projects in South Africa and Israel which resulted in impairment charges of $36 million. The Company also recognized an impairment of $18 million related to the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China. Gain on sale of investments There was no gain on sale of investments in 2010. Gain on sale of investments of $131 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $98 million recognized in May 2009 related to the termination of the management agreement between the Company and Kazakhmys PLC for Ekibastuz and Maikuben, a gain of $14 million from the sale of the remaining assets associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China and $13 million from the reversal of a contingent liability related to the Kazakhstan sale in 2008. Gain on sale of investments of $909 million in 2008 consisted primarily of the sale in May 2008 of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Ekibastuz and Maikuben for a net gain of $905 million. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock There was no loss on sale of subsidiary stock in 2010 or 2009. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock of $31 million in 2008 was the result of sales of AES Gener shares made by our wholly owned subsidiary Cachagua. In November 2008, Cachagua sold 9.6% of its ownership in Gener to a third party reducing its ownership in Gener to 70.6%. 145 Table of Contents Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Companys net monetary position from foreign currency transaction activities: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) AES Corporation $ (50 ) $ 13 $ 38 Chile 8 65 (96 ) Philippines 8 15 (57 ) Brazil (6 ) (9 ) (44 ) Argentina 12 (10 ) (28 ) Kazakhstan 1 (24 ) 14 Colombia (4 ) (11 ) 5 Other (2 ) (6 ) (16 ) Total(1) $ (33 ) $ 33 $ (184 ) (1) Includes (losses) gains of $(10) million, $(39) million and $10 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These losses consisted primarily of losses at The AES Corporation partially offset by gains in Argentina. Losses of $50 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the devaluation of notes receivable resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound, and losses on foreign exchange swaps and options, partially offset by gains on cash balances and debt denominated in British Pounds. Gains of $12 million in Argentina were primarily due to a gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso by 5%, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These gains consisted primarily of gains in Chile, the Philippines and at The AES Corporation partially offset by losses in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. Gains of $65 million in Chile were primarily due to the appreciation of the Chilean Peso of 20% resulting in gains at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Peso, mainly cash and accounts receivables. This gain was partially offset by $14 million in losses on foreign currency derivatives. Gains of $15 million in the Philippines were primarily due to the appreciation of the Philippine Peso of 3%, resulting in gains at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on the remeasurement of U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $13 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the settlement of the senior unsecured credit facility and the revaluation of notes receivable denominated in the Euro, partially offset by losses on debt denominated in British Pounds. Losses of $24 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar and $12 million of foreign currency transaction losses on debt and other liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Kazakh Tenge. 146 Table of Contents Losses of $11 million in Colombia were primarily due to the appreciation of the Colombian Peso of 9%, resulting in losses at Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its Colombian Peso denominated debt and losses on foreign currency derivatives. Losses of $10 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2009, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt, partially offset by derivative gains. Losses of $9 million in Brazil were primarily due to energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar, resulting in foreign currency transaction losses of $18 million, partially offset by gains of $9 million due to the appreciation in 2009 of the Brazilian Real of 25%, resulting in gains at Sul and Uruguaiana associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These losses consisted primarily of losses in Chile, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina partially offset by gains at The AES Corporation and in Kazakhstan. Losses of $96 million in Chile were primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso of 28% in 2008, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable and value added tax (VAT) receivables. Losses of $57 million in the Philippines were primarily due to remeasurement losses at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on U.S. Dollar denominated debt resulting from depreciation of the Philippine Peso of 14% in 2008. Losses of $44 million in Brazil were primarily due to the realization of deferred exchange variance on past energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar. Losses of $28 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2008, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $38 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to debt denominated in British Pounds and gains on foreign exchange derivatives, partially offset by losses on notes receivable denominated in the Euro. Gains of $14 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction gains of $16 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar, offset by $5 million of foreign currency transaction losses on external and intercompany debt denominated in other than the Kazakh Tenge functional currency. Income taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $292 million, or 49%, to $307 million in 2010. The Companys effective tax rates were 29% for 2010 and 26% for 2009. The net increase in the 2010 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 relating to the CEMIG sale transaction, tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowances at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, and $165 million of non taxable income recorded in 2009 at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program. These items were offset by income tax benefits related to a reversal of withholding tax liabilities at certain Chilean subsidiaries and 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries. Included in the net tax expense related to the CEMIG sale transaction is tax expense on the equity earnings associated with the reversal of the net long term liability and tax benefit related to release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. 147 Table of Contents Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $172 million, or 22%, to $599 million in 2009. The Companys effective tax rates were 26% for 2009 and 29% for 2008. The net decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowance at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recorded at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $91 million, or 99%, to $183 million in 2010 from $92 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a gain recognized upon the sale of our interest in CEMIG during the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by 2009 equity in earnings of Cartagena which was accounted for as a consolidated entity in 2010 and thus reported directly within revenues and expenses. Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $59 million, or 179%, to $92 million in 2009 from $33 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a cash settlement received by Cartagena, in Spain, in June 2009 for liquidated damages received related to a construction delay from December 2005 to November 2006; increased earnings at Guacolda in Chile mainly due to lower cost of coal; increased earnings of Chigen affiliates from higher tariffs partially offset by lower volume and a valuation write off in 2008 at an affiliate in Turkey. These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings at OPGC, in India, mainly due to lower tariff and a dividend distribution tax in March 2009 and increased expenses for an equipment overhaul at Elsta in the Netherlands. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $93 million, or 8%, to $1.0 billion in 2010 from $1.1 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreased earnings at Eletropaulo as a result of the absence of legal settlement income present in 2009, a loss on legal settlement at Gener and reduced revenues due to decreased coal prices along with higher electricity purchases at Itabo. These decreases were partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian Real. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $340 million, or 45%, to $1.1 billion in 2009 from $0.8 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to increases in gross margin and other income, lower interest expense and a decrease in impairments in 2009 at our Brazilian businesses, and increases in gross margin and foreign currency transaction gains at our businesses in Chile. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $44 million at certain of our wind generation businesses as a result of a charge related to the potential future taxes that could be deemed due in the calculation of the hypothetical liquidation value of certain of our wind tax equity partnerships. Discontinued operations As further discussed in Note 21 Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Businesses to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, Discontinued Operations includes the results of five businesses: Ras Laffan, a generation business in Qatar (sold in October 2010); Barka, a generation business in Oman, (sold in August 2010); Lal Pir and Pak Gen, generation businesses in Pakistan, (sold in June 2010); and Jiaozuo, a generation business in China, (sold in December 2008). Prior periods have been restated to reflect these businesses within Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. In 2010, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $39 million and reflected the operations of our 55% stake in Ras Laffan, a combined cycle gas facility and water desalination plant in Qatar, our 35% stake in Barka, a combined cycle gas 148 Table of Contents facility and water desalination plant in Oman and our 55% stake in Lal Pir and Pak Gen, two oil fired facilities in Pakistan. The sale of Lal Pir and Pak Gen closed in June 2010, resulting in additional impairment expense and a loss on the sale in 2010 of $14 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The Barka plant was sold in August 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $63 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The sale of Ras Laffan closed in October 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $6 million, net of tax. In 2009, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $54 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir and Pak Gen. Loss on disposal of discontinued businesses, net of tax and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $105 million and represented the difference between the net book value of the Companys interests in its Pakistan businesses and their estimated fair value. In 2008, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $60 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir, Pak Gen and Jiaozuo, a coal fired generation facility in China sold in December 2008. The Company received $73 million for its 70% interest in the business. The net gain on the disposition was $7 million. Critical Accounting Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Companys most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Reserves We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the tax jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material. 149 Table of Contents On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act). The Act includes several provisions which provide for tax relief for businesses by extending certain tax benefits and credits, including the Subpart F exception for active financing income and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look through provisions of Subpart F. This legislation resulted in a benefit for the Companys 2010 provision for income taxes; however, there can be no assurances that the benefits of this legislation will extend beyond 2011, when it is currently scheduled to expire. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Goodwill and Other Intangibles and Long lived Assets, respectively, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level on October 1. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying amount. A long lived asset (asset group) will be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e., the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are less than its carrying amount. In the event that the carrying amount of the long lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment evaluation is performed, in which the fair value of the asset is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. Examples of indicators that would result in an impairment test for goodwill and a recoverability test for long lived assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate, legislation changes or a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition. Throughout the impairment evaluation process, management makes considerable judgments; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part of an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost/benefit analysis and the Companys internal valuation knowledge of the long lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the DCF model), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factors expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. 150 Table of Contents A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Managements Discussion and Analysis, Consolidated Results of Operations Goodwill Impairment and Asset Impairment Expense and Note 19 Impairment Expense and Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Fair Value Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent), derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long term liabilities. The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Companys investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Companys derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where 151 Table of Contents derivatives qualify and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Companys interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Companys derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterpartys) and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Platts). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instruments fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on indicative pricing quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities The Company adopted the fair value measurement accounting guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009. The most significant of these estimates surround the fair value measurement of long lived tangible and intangible assets when tested for impairment upon a triggering event or during the annual impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill. These estimates include making assumptions regarding useful life, the impact of economic obsolescence and expected future cash flows. Additional factors are discussed above in the Impairments section. 152 Table of Contents Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard creates a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Global Economic Conditions. Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather. Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In the past, our businesses in Latin America have been negatively impacted by lower than normal rainfall. Similarly, our wind businesses are dependent on adequate wind conditions while the solar projects at AES Solar are dependent on sufficient sunlight. In each case, inadequate wind or sunlight could have a material adverse impact on these businesses. Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes. Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our Utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to: changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations; 90 Table of Contents changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utilitys operating income or the rates it charges customers is too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates; changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non controllable costs; adverse changes in tax law; changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium; changes in the timing of tariff increases; other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business. Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business. In many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing or the regulations can be difficult to interpret. As a result, there is risk that we may not properly interpret certain regulations and may not understand the impact of certain regulations on our business. For example, in October 2006, ANEEL, which regulates our utility operations at Sul and Eletropaulo in Brazil, issued Normative Resolution 234 requiring that utilities begin amortizing a liability called Special Obligations beginning with their second tariff reset cycle in 2007 or a later year as an offset to depreciation expense. As of May 23, 2007, the date of the filing of our 2006 Form 10 K, no industry positions or any other consensus had been reached regarding how ANEEL guidance should be applied at that date and accordingly, no adjustments to the financial statements were made relating to Special Obligations in Brazil. Subsequent to May 23, 2007, industry discussions occurred and other Brazilian companies filed Forms 20 F with the SEC reflecting the impact of Resolution 234 in their December 31, 2006 financial statements differently from how the Company accounted for Resolution 234. In the absence of any significant regulatory developments between May 23, 2007 and the date of these other filings, the Company determined that Resolution 234 required us to record an adjustment to our Special Obligations liability as of December 31, 2006. In part, the decision to record the adjustment led to the restatement of our financial statements in the third quarter of 2007. If we face additional challenges interpreting regulations or changes in regulations, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act). While the bulk of regulations contained in the Dodd Frank Act regulate financial institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive compensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to public companies generally. The types of provisions described above are currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Furthermore, while the Dodd Frank Act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, the Dodd Frank Act provides for commercial end user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions, though this is not certain since the Act directs the SEC, CFTC and listed companies to enact rules that will clarify the Dodd Frank Act, and such rulemaking could impact the availability of the commercial end user exemption. Even if the exemption is available, the Dodd Frank Act could still have a material adverse impact on the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non exempt companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these risks. Even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, which could adversely affect the operating results of certain projects; cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated to hedge certain risks, such as project financing agreements; prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; cause the Company to abandon certain of its hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; and or consume substantial liquidity by forcing the Company to post cash and or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 91 Table of Contents On June 12, 2009 AES Kelanitissa received a letter and an invoice from the Director General, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUC) seeking payment of an Annual Regulatory Fee and pursuant to PUC assurances on an application for renewal of the AES Kelanitissa generation license. The application is pursuant to an April 2009 revision of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act (Electricity Act), which came into force in April 2009, notwithstanding that in March 29, 2001, AES Kelanitissa had been granted, and pre paid fees for, a 21 year generation license with effect from September 25, 2000 under the Electricity Act, 1950. AES Kelanitissa submitted an application to be licensed under the revised legislation and, on August 26, 2009, PUC published its intention to issue a generation license under the revised legislation to AES Kelanitissa and other Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in Sri Lanka. This was consistent with assurances received from relevant authorities that the revised legislation was to be amended to grandfather IPPs with existing generation licenses. In a letter dated June 21, 2010 from the PUC, AES Kelanitissa was informed that under the new regulations, as amended in 2009, AES Kelanitissa (Pvt) Ltd no longer fulfilled the eligibility criteria to apply for a generation license. The eligibility criteria to which the letter refers is a provision requiring an element of state ownership. Representatives of AES Kelanitissa have been informed that an amendment to the Electricity Act to grandfather existing IPPs remains in the legislative pipeline, although it is not possible to predict with certainty when or whether such an amendment will be passed. In addition, AES Kelanitissa believes that under Sri Lankan law, it may continue operations under the 21 year license issued in 2001. No step has been taken to date to prohibit AES Kelanitissa from generating power and conducting its operations. However, in the event that it is determined that AES Kelanitissa may not operate under its current license or the revised legislation is not amended (and PUC maintains that AES Kelanitissa is ineligible for a generation license or extension of the Generating License), AES Kelanitissa may not be able to continue operations on grounds that it has no license under the revised legislation. In that event, AES Kelanitissa and or the Company could face a number of adverse consequences, including potential litigation with counterparties mitigating a write down in the value of the assets of the business, continued default status under its debt documents and or other consequences which could have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Our Generation business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the FERC, including the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations. EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the obligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of the Midwest Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) Interconnection, L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is authorized under the new law to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case by case basis. While the new law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to PURPA, our QFs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long term contracts expire. EPAct 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the United States generation market. 92 Table of Contents In accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets. While the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost of service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate. Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our activities are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air and water emissions. See the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters of this Form 10 K. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies. The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal fired generating plants alleging wide spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with approximately 17 companies over such allegations. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. The principal focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO2 and NOX. In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOX. One of our businesses, IPL, is currently the subject of such an EPA enforcement action, and another business, Eastern Energy, has received an information request from the EPA in connection with a possible enforcement action. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10 K for more detail with respect to these EPA enforcement actions and information requests. There can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations. 93 Table of Contents Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As discussed in Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations, at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect or policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2010, the Companys subsidiaries operated businesses which had total approximate CO2 emissions of 77.2 million metric tonnes approximately 40 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 18 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based upon a number of projections and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect such as the forecast dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO2 emissions and our subsidiaries achieving completion of such construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with emissions described below. Because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates. The subsidiaries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there can be no assurance that the subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the Company. Foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial performance. The actual impact on the Companys financial performance and the financial performance of the Companys subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the cost of emissions reduction equipment the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material impact on our results of operations. In January 2005, based on European Community Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading, the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) commenced operation as the largest multi country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires the 40 developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO2. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In the United States, there currently is no legislation establishing federal mandatory GHG emission reduction programs (including CO2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. However, federal GHG legislation has been proposed in the United States Congress that would, if enacted, constrain GHG emissions, including CO2, and or impose costs on 94 Table of Contents us that could be material to our business or results of operations. The EPA has also initiated regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new sources of GHG emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing sources planning physical changes that would increase their GHG emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. Such regulations could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse effect on our business and or results of operations. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regulations. At the state level, RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast, became effective in January 2009, and the WCI is also developing market based programs to address GHG emissions in seven western states. In addition, several states, including California, have adopted comprehensive legislation that, when effective, will require mandatory GHG reductions from several industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations of this Form 10 K for further discussion about the United States state environmental regulations we face. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below), the Company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with United States federal, regional or state CO2 emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that these proposals are in earlier stages of development and any final regulations or legislation, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals. The RGGI program became effective in January 2009. The first regional auction of RGGI allowances needed to be acquired by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI was held in September 2008, with subsequent auctions occurring approximately every quarter. Our subsidiaries in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland are subject to RGGI. Of the approximately 40 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2010 (ownership adjusted), approximately 11.3 million metric tonnes were emitted in United States states participating in RGGI. Over the past three years, such emissions have averaged approximately 10.9 million metric tonnes. While CO2 emissions from businesses operated by subsidiaries of the Company are calculated globally in metric tonnes, RGGI allowances are denominated in short tons. (1 metric tonne equals 2,200 pounds and 1 short ton equals 2,000 pounds.) For forecasting purposes, the Company has modeled the impact of CO2 compliance based on a 3 year average of CO2 emissions for its businesses that are subject to RGGI and that may not be able to pass through compliance costs. The model includes a conversion from metric tonnes to short tons as well as the impact of some market recovery by merchant plants and contractual and regulatory provisions. The model also utilizes a price of $1.86 per allowance under RGGI. The source of this allowance price estimate was the clearing price in the recent RGGI allowance auction held in December 2010. Based on these assumptions, the Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $15 million for 2011, which is the last year of the first RGGI compliance period. Given the fact that the assumptions utilized in the model may prove to be incorrect, there is a significant risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance. In addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. For example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. In addition, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. In addition, environmental groups and other private plaintiffs have brought and may decide to bring additional private lawsuits against the Company because of its subsidiaries GHG emissions. The Company is facing and may face in the future private lawsuits relating to GHG emissions that may have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. In one recent case in the United States, which does not involve the Company, a federal appellate court reversed the dismissal by a federal district court of nuisance and other claims against emitters of GHG based on property damage allegedly caused by their contributions to global warming. While the scope of relief sought in that case is 95 Table of Contents unclear, the plaintiffs in this case evidently seek injunctive relief to prevent or reduce further GHG emissions. The defendants appealed the appellate court decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court is expected to render a decision in 2011. If the defendants do not prevail, other parties may be encouraged to bring similar suits against electric power generators, including the Company or any of its United States subsidiaries. Also, unless the United States Congress acts to preempt such suits as part of comprehensive federal legislation, additional lawsuits may be brought against the Company or its subsidiaries. At this stage of the litigation, it is impossible to predict whether such lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the Companys business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Companys subsidiaries. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel fired electric power generation facilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation. In addition to potential physical risks noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of the Company and its subsidiaries due to public perception of GHG emissions by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHG emissions made by subsidiaries of the Company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the Company. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the Companys subsidiaries and on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our subsidiaries have operations in the United States and various non United States jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many non United States jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as non United States, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities. We and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. We and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. 96 Table of Contents The SEC is conducting an informal inquiry relating to our restatements. We have been cooperating with an informal inquiry by the SEC Staff concerning our past restatements and related matters, and have been providing information and documents to the SEC Staff on a voluntary basis. Although we have not received correspondence regarding this inquiry for some time, we have not been advised that the matter is closed. Because we are unable to predict the outcome of this inquiry, the SEC Staff may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported the financial impact of the adjustments to previously filed financial statements and there may be a risk that the inquiry by the SEC could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate previously filed financial statements, amend prior filings or take other actions not currently contemplated. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We maintain offices in many places around the world, generally pursuant to the provisions of long and short term leases, none of which we believe are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are described in Item 1 of this Form 10 K, are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the projects related finance facility. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased. However, in a few instances, no accompanying project financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business, some of which are described below. The Company has accrued for litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has evaluated claims in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies that it deems both probable and reasonably estimable and accordingly, has recorded aggregate reserves for all claims for approximately $450 million and $482 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. These are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within accrued and other liabilities and other long term liabilities. A significant portion of these reserves relate to employment, non income tax and customer disputes in international jurisdictions, principally Brazil. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries, principally in Brazil, are defendants in a number of labor and employment lawsuits. The complaints generally seek unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or other relief. The subsidiaries have denied any liability and intend to vigorously defend themselves in all of these proceedings. There can be no assurance that this reserve will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise. The Company believes, based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. However, even where no reserve has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company, and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material. In 1989, Centrais El&eacute;tricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobr&aacute;s) filed suit in the Fifth District Court in the State of Rio de Janeiro against Eletropaulo Eletricidade de S&atilde;o Paulo S.A. (EEDSP) relating to the methodology for calculating monetary adjustments under the parties financing agreement. In April 1999, the Fifth District Court 97 Table of Contents found for Eletrobr&aacute;s and in September 2001, Eletrobr&aacute;s initiated an execution suit in the Fifth District Court to collect approximately R$1.10 billion ($659 million) from Eletropaulo (as estimated by Eletropaulo) and a lesser amount from an unrelated company, Companhia de Transmiss&atilde;o de Energia El&eacute;trica Paulista (CTEEP) (Eletropaulo and CTEEP were spun off from EEDSP pursuant to its privatization in 1998). In November 2002, the Fifth District Court rejected Eletropaulos defenses in the execution suit. Eletropaulo appealed and in September 2003, the Appellate Court of the State of Rio de Janeiro (AC) ruled that Eletropaulo was not a proper party to the litigation because any alleged liability had been transferred to CTEEP pursuant to the privatization. In June 2006, the Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) reversed the Appellate Courts decision and remanded the case to the Fifth District Court for further proceedings, holding that Eletropaulos liability, if any, should be determined by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulos subsequent appeals to the Special Court (the highest court within the SCJ) and the Supreme Court of Brazil were dismissed. Eletrobr&aacute;s later requested that the amount of Eletropaulos alleged debt be determined by an accounting expert appointed by the Fifth District Court. Eletropaulo consented to the appointment of such an expert, subject to a reservation of rights. In February 2010, the Fifth District Court appointed an accounting expert to determine the amount of the alleged debt and the responsibility for its payment in light of the privatization, in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletrobr&aacute;s. Pursuant to its reservation of rights, Eletropaulo filed an interlocutory appeal with the AC asserting that the expert was required to determine the issues in accordance with the methodology proposed by Eletropaulo, and that Eletropaulo should be entitled to take discovery and present arguments on the issues to be determined by the expert. In April 2010, the AC issued a decision agreeing with Eletropaulos arguments and directing the Fifth District Court to proceed accordingly. Eletrobr&aacute;s may restart the accounting proceedings at the Fifth District Court at any time, which would proceed according to the ACs April 2010 decision. In the Fifth District Court proceedings, the experts conclusions will be subject to the Fifth District Courts review and approval. If Eletropaulo is determined to be responsible for the debt, after the amount of the alleged debt is determined, Eletrobr&aacute;s will be entitled to resume the execution suit in the Fifth District Court at any time. If Eletrobr&aacute;s does so, Eletropaulo will be required to provide security in the amount of its alleged liability. In that case, if Eletrobr&aacute;s requests the seizure of such security and the Fifth District Court grants such request, Eletropaulos results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and in turn the Companys results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, in February 2008, CTEEP filed a lawsuit in the Fifth District Court against Eletrobr&aacute;s and Eletropaulo seeking a declaration that CTEEP is not liable for any debt under the financing agreement. The parties are disputing the proper venue for the CTEEP lawsuit. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In August 2000, the FERC announced an investigation into the organized California wholesale power markets to determine whether rates were just and reasonable. Further investigations involved alleged market manipulation. FERC requested documents from each of the AES Southland, LLC plants and AES Placerita, Inc. AES Southland and AES Placerita have cooperated fully with the FERC investigations. AES Southland was not subject to refund liability because it did not sell into the organized spot markets due to the nature of its tolling agreement. After hearings at FERC, AES Placerita was found subject to refund liability of $588,000 plus interest for spot sales to the California Power Exchange from October 2, 2000 to June 20, 2001. As FERC investigations and hearings progressed, numerous appeals on related issues were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Over the years, the Ninth Circuit issued several opinions that had the potential to expand the scope of the FERC proceedings and increase refund exposure for AES Placerita and other sellers of electricity. Following remand of one of the Ninth Circuit appeals in March 2009, FERC started a new hearing process involving AES Placerita and other sellers. In May 2009, AES Placerita entered into a settlement, approved by FERC in July 2009, concerning the claims before FERC against AES Placerita relating to the California energy crisis of 2000 2001, including the California refund proceeding. Pursuant to the settlement, AES Placerita paid $6 million and assigned a receivable of $168,119 due to it from the California Power Exchange in return for a release of all claims against it at FERC by the settling parties and other consideration. More than 98% of the buyers in the market elected to join the settlement. A small amount of AES Placeritas settlement payment was placed in escrow for buyers that did not join the settlement (non settling parties). It is unclear whether the escrowed funds will be enough to satisfy any additional sums that might be determined to be owed to 98 Table of Contents non settling parties at the conclusion of the FERC proceedings concerning the California energy crisis. However, any such additional sums are expected to be immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2009, one non settling party, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), filed an appeal of the FERCs approval of the settlement which is pending in the Ninth Circuit. SMUDs appeal has been stayed pending further order of the court. The settlement agreement is still effective and will continue to remain effective unless it is vacated by the Ninth Circuit. SMUD has reached a settlement in principal with buyers of electricity that, if approved by FERC, will leave only immaterial claims of non settling parties against AES Placerita. In August 2001, the Grid Corporation of Orissa, India, now Gridco Ltd. (Gridco), filed a petition against the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (CESCO), an affiliate of the Company, with the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC), alleging that CESCO had defaulted on its obligations as an OERC licensed distribution company, that CESCO management abandoned the management of CESCO, and asking for interim measures of protection, including the appointment of an administrator to manage CESCO. Gridco, a state owned entity, is the sole wholesale energy provider to CESCO. Pursuant to the OERCs August 2001 order, the management of CESCO was replaced with a government administrator who was appointed by the OERC. The OERC later held that the Company and other CESCO shareholders were not necessary or proper parties to the OERC proceeding. In August 2004, the OERC issued a notice to CESCO, the Company and others giving the recipients of the notice until November 2004 to show cause why CESCOs distribution license should not be revoked. In response, CESCO submitted a business plan to the OERC. In February 2005, the OERC issued an order rejecting the proposed business plan. The order also stated that the CESCO distribution license would be revoked if an acceptable business plan for CESCO was not submitted to and approved by the OERC prior to March 31, 2005. In its April 2, 2005 order, the OERC revoked the CESCO distribution license. CESCO has filed an appeal against the April 2, 2005 OERC order and that appeal remains pending in the Indian courts. In addition, Gridco asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Companys indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCOs financial obligations to Gridco. In December 2001, Gridco served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limited (AES ODPL), and Jyoti Structures (Jyoti) pursuant to the terms of the CESCO Shareholders Agreement between Gridco, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and CESCO (the CESCO arbitration). In the arbitration, Gridco appeared to be seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by Gridco. The Company counterclaimed against Gridco for damages. In June 2007, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting Gridcos claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to Gridco. The respondents counterclaims were also rejected. In September 2007, Gridco filed a challenge of the arbitration award with the local Indian court. In June 2008, Gridco filed a separate application with the local Indian court for an order enjoining the Company from selling or otherwise transferring its shares in Orissa Power Generation Corporation Ltd.s (OPGC), an equity method investment, and requiring the Company to provide security in the amount of the contested damages in the CESCO arbitration until Gridcos challenge to the arbitration award is resolved. In June 2010, a 2 to 1 majority of the arbitral tribunal awarded the Company some of its costs relating to the arbitration. In August 2010, Gridco filed a challenge of the cost award with the local Indian court. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In early 2002, Gridco made an application to the OERC requesting that the OERC initiate proceedings regarding the terms of OPGCs existing PPA with Gridco. In response, OPGC filed a petition in the Indian courts to block any such OERC proceedings. In early 2005, the Orissa High Court upheld the OERCs jurisdiction to initiate such proceedings as requested by Gridco. OPGC appealed that High Courts decision to the Supreme Court and sought stays of both the High Courts decision and the underlying OERC proceedings regarding the PPAs terms. In April 2005, the Supreme Court granted OPGCs requests and ordered stays of the High Courts decision and the OERC proceedings with respect to the PPAs terms. The matter is awaiting further hearing. 99 Table of Contents Unless the Supreme Court finds in favor of OPGCs appeal or otherwise prevents the OERCs proceedings regarding the PPAs terms, the OERC will likely lower the tariff payable to OPGC under the PPA, which would have an adverse impact on OPGCs financials. OPGC believes that it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In March 2003, the office of the Federal Public Prosecutor for the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (MPF) notified AES Eletropaulo that it had commenced an inquiry related to the BNDES financings provided to AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and the rationing loan provided to Eletropaulo, changes in the control of Eletropaulo, sales of assets by Eletropaulo and the quality of service provided by Eletropaulo to its customers, and requested various documents from Eletropaulo relating to these matters. In July 2004, the MPF filed a public civil lawsuit in the Federal Court of S&atilde;o Paulo (FSCP) alleging that BNDES violated Law 8429/92 (the Administrative Misconduct Act) and BNDESs internal rules by: (1) approving the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (2) extending the payment terms on the AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s loans; (3) authorizing the sale of Eletropaulos preferred shares at a stock market auction; (4) accepting Eletropaulos preferred shares to secure the loan provided to Eletropaulo; and (5) allowing the restructurings of Light Servi&ccedil;os de Eletricidade S.A. and Eletropaulo. The MPF also named AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s as defendants in the lawsuit because they allegedly benefited from BNDESs alleged violations. In May 2006, the FCSP ruled that the MPF could pursue its claims based on the first, second, and fourth alleged violations noted above. The MPF subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal with the Federal Court of Appeals (FCA) seeking to require the FCSP to consider all five alleged violations. Also, in July 2006, AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s filed an interlocutory appeal with the FCA, which was subsequently consolidated with the MPFs interlocutory appeal, seeking a transfer of venue and to enjoin the FCSP from considering any of the alleged violations. In June 2009, the FCA granted the injunction sought by AES Elpa and AES Transg&aacute;s and transferred the case to the Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro. In May 2010, the MPF filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Justice challenging the transfer. The MPFs lawsuit before the FCSP has been stayed pending a final decision on the interlocutory appeals. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana (the successor of AES Transg&aacute;s) believe they have meritorious defenses to the allegations asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. AES Florestal, Ltd. (Florestal), had been operating a pole factory and had other assets, including a wooded area known as Horto Renner, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (collectively, Property). Florestal had been under the control of AES Sul (Sul) since October 1997, when Sul was created pursuant to a privatization by the Government of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. After it came under the control of Sul, Florestal performed an environmental audit of the entire operational cycle at the pole factory. The audit discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at the pole factory. The audit concluded that the prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia El&eacute;trica (CEEE), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. Sul and Florestal subsequently took the initiative of communicating with Brazilian authorities, as well as CEEE, about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. The Public Attorneys Office has initiated a civil inquiry (Civil Inquiry n. 24/05) to investigate potential civil liability and has requested that the police station of Triunfo institute a police investigation (IP number 1041/05) to investigate potential criminal liability regarding the contamination at the pole factory. The parties filed defenses in response to the civil inquiry. The Public Attorneys Office then requested an injunction which the judge rejected on September 26, 2008. The Public Attorneys office has a right to appeal the decision. The environmental agency (FEPAM) has also started a procedure (Procedure n. 088200567/059) to analyze the measures that shall be taken to contain and remediate the contamination. Also, in March 2000, Sul filed suit against CEEE in the 2nd Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre seeking to register in Suls name the Property that it acquired through the privatization but that remained registered in CEEEs name. During those proceedings, AES subsequently waived its claim to re register the Property and asserted a claim to recover the amounts paid for the Property. That claim is pending. In November 2005, the 7th Court of Public Treasure of Porto Alegre ruled that the Property must be returned to CEEE. CEEE has had sole possession of Horto Renner since September 2006 and of the rest of the Property since April 2006. In February 2008, Sul 100 Table of Contents and CEEE signed a Technical Cooperation Protocol pursuant to which they requested a new deadline from FEPAM in order to present a proposal. In March 2008, the State Prosecution office filed a Public Class Action against AES Florestal, AES Sul and CEEE, requiring an injunction for the removal of the alleged sources of contamination and the payment of an indemnity in the amount of R$6 million ($4 million). The injunction was rejected and the case is in the evidentiary stage awaiting the judges determination concerning the production of expert evidence. The above referenced proposal was delivered on April 8, 2008. FEPAM responded by indicating that the parties should undertake the first step of the proposal which would be to retain a contractor. In its response, Sul indicated that such step should be undertaken by CEEE as the relevant environmental events resulted from CEEEs operations. It is estimated that remediation could cost approximately R$14.7 million ($9 million). Discussions between Sul and CEEE are ongoing. In January 2004, the Company received notice of a Formulation of Charges filed against the Company by the Superintendence of Electricity of the Dominican Republic. In the Formulation of Charges, the Superintendence asserts that the existence of three generation companies (Empresa Generadora de Electricidad Itabo, S.A. (Itabo), Dominican Power Partners, and AES Andres BV) and one distribution company (Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S.A. (Este)) in the Dominican Republic, violates certain cross ownership restrictions contained in the General Electricity Law of the Dominican Republic. In February 2004, the Company filed in the First Instance Court of the National District of the Dominican Republic an action seeking injunctive relief based on several constitutional due process violations contained in the Formulation of Charges (Constitutional Injunction). In February 2004, the Court granted the Constitutional Injunction and ordered the immediate cessation of any effects of the Formulation of Charges, and the enactment by the Superintendence of Electricity of a special procedure to prosecute alleged antitrust complaints under the General Electricity Law. In March 2004, the Superintendence of Electricity appealed the Courts decision. In July 2004, the Company divested any interest in Este. The Superintendence of Electricitys appeal is pending. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July 2004, the Corporaci&oacute;n Dominicana de Empresas El&eacute;ctricas Estatales (CDEEE) filed lawsuits against Itabo, an affiliate of the Company, in the First and Fifth Chambers of the Civil and Commercial Court of First Instance for the National District. CDEEE alleges in both lawsuits that Itabo spent more than was necessary to rehabilitate two generation units of an Itabo power plant and, in the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, that those funds were paid to affiliates and subsidiaries of AES Gener and Coastal Itabo, Ltd. (Coastal), a former shareholder of Itabo, without the required approval of Itabos board of administration. In the First Chamber lawsuit, CDEEE seeks an accounting of Itabos transactions relating to the rehabilitation. In November 2004, the First Chamber dismissed the case for lack of legal basis. On appeal, in October 2005 the Court of Appeals of Santo Domingo ruled in Itabos favor, reasoning that it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute because the parties contracts mandated arbitration. The Supreme Court of Justice is considering CDEEEs appeal of the Court of Appeals decision. In the Fifth Chamber lawsuit, which also names Itabos former president as a defendant, CDEEE seeks $15 million in damages and the seizure of Itabos assets. In October 2005, the Fifth Chamber held that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute given the arbitration provisions in the parties contracts. The First Chamber of the Court of Appeal ratified that decision in September 2006. In a related proceeding, in May 2005, Itabo filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to compel CDEEE to arbitrate its claims. The petition was denied in July 2005. Itabos appeal of that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has been stayed since September 2006. Further, in September 2006, in an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration, an arbitral tribunal determined that it lacked jurisdiction to decide arbitration claims concerning these disputes. Itabo believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In April 2006, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi (District Court) on behalf of certain individual plaintiffs and all residents and or property owners in the State of Mississippi who allegedly suffered harm as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, whose alleged greenhouse gas emissions contributed to alleged global 101 Table of Contents warming which, in turn, allegedly increased the destructive capacity of Hurricane Katrina. The plaintiffs assert unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy/aiding and abetting, public and private nuisance, trespass, negligence, and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment claims against the defendants. The plaintiffs seek damages relating to loss of property, loss of business, clean up costs, personal injuries and death, but do not quantify their alleged damages. In August 2007, the District Court dismissed the case. The plaintiffs subsequently appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which, in October 2009, affirmed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs unjust enrichment, fraudulent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy claims. However, the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal of the plaintiffs public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence claims, and remanded those claims to the District Court for further proceedings. In February 2010, the Fifth Circuit granted the petitions for en banc rehearing filed by the Company and other defendants, and thereby vacated its October 2009 decision. In May 2010, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had lost its quorum for en banc review. In August 2010, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the U.S. Supreme Court, requesting the Supreme Court to direct the Fifth Circuit to reinstate the appeal and return it to the panel that issued the October 2009 decision. In January 2011, the Supreme Court denied the petition, ending the case. In July 2007, the Competition Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the Competition Committee) ordered Nurenergoservice, an AES subsidiary, to pay approximately KZT 18 billion ($120 million) for alleged antimonopoly violations in 2005 through the first quarter of 2007. The Competition Committees order was affirmed by the economic court in April 2008 (April 2008 Decision). The economic court also issued an injunction to secure Nurenergoservices alleged liability, freezing Nurenergoservices bank accounts and prohibiting Nurenergoservice from transferring or disposing of its property. Nurenergoservices subsequent appeals to the court of appeals were rejected. In February 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency (the Competition Committees successor) seized approximately KZT 783 million ($5 million) from a frozen Nurenergoservice bank account in partial satisfaction of Nurenergoservices alleged damages liability. However, on appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court, in October 2009, the Supreme Court annulled the decisions of the lower courts because of procedural irregularities and remanded the case to the economic court for reconsideration. On remand, in January 2010, the economic court reaffirmed its April 2008 Decision. Nurenergoservices appeals in the court of appeals (first panel) and the court of appeals (second panel) were unsuccessful. Nurenergoservice intends to file a further appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court. In separate but related proceedings, in August 2007, the Competition Committee ordered Nurenergoservice to pay approximately KZT 1.8 billion ($12 million) in administrative fines for its alleged antimonopoly violations. Nurenergoservices appeal to the administrative court was rejected in February 2009. Given the adverse court decisions against Nurenergoservice, the Antimonopoly Agency may attempt to seize Nurenergoservices remaining assets, which are immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Antimonopoly Agency has not indicated whether it intends to assert claims against Nurenergoservice for alleged antimonopoly violations post first quarter 2007. Nurenergoservice believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it; however, there can be no assurances that it will prevail in these proceedings. In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of the power sales of Ust Kamenogorsk HPP (UK HPP) and Shulbinsk HPP, hydroelectric plants under AES concession (collectively, the Hydros), in January through February 2009. The investigation of Shulbinsk HPP is ongoing, but the investigation of UK HPP has been completed. The Antimonopoly Agency determined that UK HPP abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power in January through February 2009. The Agency sought an order from the administrative court requiring UK HPP to pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 120 million ($1 million) and to disgorge profits for the period at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately KZT 440 million ($3 million). No fines or damages have been paid to date, however, as the proceedings in the administrative court have been suspended due to the initiation of related criminal proceedings against officials of UK HPP. The Hydros believe they have meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. 102 Table of Contents In April 2009, the Antimonopoly Agency initiated an investigation of Ust Kamenogorsk TETS LLPs (UKT) power sales in 2008 through February 2009. The Antimonopoly Agency subsequently concluded that UKT abused its market position and charged monopolistically high prices for power and should pay an administrative fine of approximately KZT 136 million ($1 million). The Antimonopoly Agency later sought an order from the administrative court requiring UKT to pay the fine. The administrative court proceedings have been suspended due to a related criminal investigation of UKT employees. If the investigation is terminated and the Antimonopoly Agency prevails in the administrative proceedings, UKT may be ordered to pay the administrative fine and disgorge the profits from the sales at issue, estimated by the Antimonopoly Agency to be approximately 514 million KZT ($3 million). UKT believes it has meritorious defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In December 2007, an arbitral tribunal terminated ESSAs gas supply contracts with members of the Sierra Chata Consortium in light of the restrictions that had been placed on the export of gas by the Argentine Republic. ESSA thereafter terminated its gas transportation contract with Transportadora de Gas del Norte S.A. (TGN), and initiated arbitration seeking relief from the obligation to pay the firm tariff under ESSAs gas transportation contracts with Gasoducto GasAndes (Argentina) S.A. (GasAndes Argentina) and Gasoducto GasAndes S.A. (GasAndes Chile) or in the alternative, termination of such contracts. TGN (which later filed a lawsuit against ESSA in Argentina), GasAndes Argentina, and GasAndes Chile disputed that the restrictions on the export of gas justified the adjustment or termination of the respective gas transportation contracts and sought due tariff payments. On December 29, 2010, ESSA reached settlement agreements with GasAndes Argentina, GasAndes Chile, and TGN terminating the respective gas transportation contracts and resolving all pending legal disputes and potential future claims. ESSA recognized approximately $72 million as other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2010 related to the settlement agreements. Upon termination of the TGN gas transportation contract, ESSA is no longer required to pay certain charges imposed by the Argentine Republic relating to gas supply infrastructure. In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina, Alaska, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and numerous unrelated companies, claiming that the defendants alleged GHG emissions have contributed to alleged global warming which, in turn, allegedly has led to the erosion of the plaintiffs alleged land. The plaintiffs assert nuisance and concert of action claims against the Company and the other defendants, and a conspiracy claim against a subset of the other defendants. The plaintiffs seek to recover relocation costs, indicated in the complaint to be from $95 million to $400 million, and other unspecified damages from the defendants. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the District Court granted in October 2009. The plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The parties have briefed the appeal and are awaiting a date for oral argument. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In July, 1993 the Public Attorneys office filed a claim against Eletropaulo, the Sao Paulo State Government, SABESP (a state owned company), CETESB (a state owned company) and DAEE (the municipal Water and Electric Energy Department) alleging that they were liable for pollution of the Billings Reservoir as a result of pumping water from the Pinheiros River into the Billings Reservoir. The events in question occurred while Eletropaulo was a state owned company. An initial lower court decision in 2007 found the parties liable for the payment of approximately R$670 million ($401 million) for remediation. Eletropaulo subsequently appealed the decision to the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo which reversed the lower court decision. In 2009, the Public Attorneys Office has filed appeals to both Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) and the Supreme Court (SC) and such appeals were answered by Eletropaulo in the fourth quarter of 2009. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 1996, a public civil action was asserted against Eletropaulo and Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Desportiva Cultural Eletropaulo (the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o) relating to alleged environmental damage caused by construction of the 103 Table of Contents Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o near Guarapiranga Reservoir. The initial decision that was upheld by the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo in 2006 found that Eletropaulo should repair the alleged environmental damage by demolishing certain construction and reforesting the area, and either sponsor an environmental project which would cost approximately R$1 million ($599 thousand) as of December 31, 2010, or pay an indemnification amount of approximately R$10.2 million ($6 million). Eletropaulo has appealed this decision to the Supreme Court and is awaiting a decision. In February 2009, a CAA Section 114 information request from the EPA regarding Cayuga and Somerset was received. The request seeks various operating and testing data and other information regarding certain types of projects at the Cayuga and Somerset facilities, generally for the time period from January 1, 2000 through the date of the information request. This type of information request has been used in the past to assist the EPA in determining whether a plant is in compliance with applicable standards under the CAA. Cayuga and Somerset responded to the EPAs information request in June 2009, and they are awaiting a response from the EPA regarding their submittal. At this time, it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this request may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position. On February 2, 2009, the Cayuga facility received a Notice of Violation from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) that the facility had exceeded the permitted volume limit of coal ash that can be disposed of in the on site landfill. Cayuga has met with NYSDEC and submitted a Landfill Liner Demonstration Report to them. Such report found that the landfill has adequate engineering integrity to support the additional coal ash and there is no inherent environmental threat. NYSDEC has indicated they accept the finding of the report. A permit modification was approved by the NYSDEC on May 14, 2010 and such permit modification allows for closure of this approximately 10 acre portion of the landfill. The construction in accordance with the approved permit modification was completed in November 2010 and the certification report for this construction project is currently being drafted to submit to the NYSDEC in the second quarter of 2011. While at this time it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, this matter may have on the Company, its results of operations or its financial position, based upon the discussions to date, the Company does not believe the impact will be material. In March 2009, AES Uruguaiana Empreendimentos S.A. (AESU) initiated arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against YPF S.A. (YPF) seeking damages and other relief relating to YPFs breach of the parties gas supply agreement (GSA). Thereafter, in April 2009, YPF initiated arbitration in the ICC against AESU and two unrelated parties, Companhia de Gas do Esado do Rio Grande do Sul and Transportador de Gas del Mercosur S.A. (TGM), claiming that AESU wrongfully terminated the GSA and caused the termination of a transportation agreement (TA) between YPF and TGM (YPF Arbitration). YPF seeks an unspecified amount of damages from AESU, a declaration that YPFs performance was excused under the GSA due to certain alleged force majeure events, or, in the alternative, a declaration that the GSA and the TA should be terminated without a finding of liability against YPF because of the allegedly onerous obligations imposed on YPF by those agreements. In addition, in the YPF Arbitration, TGM asserts that if it is determined that AESU is responsible for the termination of the GSA, AESU is liable for TGMs alleged losses, including losses under the TA. The procedural schedules for the arbitrations have been established but the hearing dates have not been scheduled to date. AESU believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Chile affirmed a January 2009 decision of the Valparaiso Court of Appeals (VCA) that the environmental permit for Empresa Electrica Campiches (EEC) thermal power plant (Plant) was not properly granted and illegal. Construction of the Plant stopped as a consequence of the Supreme Courts decision. In December 2009, Chilean authorities approved new land use regulations that entitled EEC to apply for a new environmental permit. EEC applied for a new environmental permit in January 2010 and permit approval was granted by the Environmental Authority in February 2010. In March 2010, the Mayor of Puchuncav&iacute; and another third party challenged the new environmental permit before the VCA. The parties later entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the challenge to the new environmental permit 104 Table of Contents was withdrawn in July 2010. In addition, the construction permit that is required to resume construction of the Plant was issued by the Municipality in August 2010. In September 2010, neighbors of Puchuncav&iacute; challenged the construction permit filing claims in the VCA. In November 2010, the VCA rejected the claims. The challenging parties subsequently filed appeals with the Supreme Court. In January 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the VCA, finally rejecting the constitutional action. EEC has resumed construction of the Plant. In June 2009, the Inter American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States (IACHR) requested that the Republic of Panama suspend the construction of AES Changuinola S.A.s hydroelectric project (Project) until the bodies of the Inter American human rights system can issue a final decision on a petition (286/08) claiming that the construction violates the human rights of alleged indigenous communities. In July 2009, Panama responded by informing the IACHR that it would not suspend construction of the Project and requesting that the IACHR revoke its request. In June 2010, the Inter American Court of Human Rights vacated the IACHRs request. With respect to the merits of the underlying petition, the IACHR heard arguments by the communities and Panama in November 2009, but has not issued a decision to date. The Company cannot predict Panamas response to any determination on the merits of the petition by the bodies of the Inter American human rights system. In July 2009, AES Energ&iacute;a Cartagena S.R.L. (AES Cartagena) received notices from the Spanish national energy regulator, Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de Energ&iacute;a (CNE), stating that the proceeds of the sale of electricity from AES Cartagenas plant should be reduced by roughly the value of the CO2 allowances that were granted to AES Cartagena for free for the years 2007, 2008, and the first half of 2009. In particular, the notices stated that CNE intended to invoice AES Cartagena to recover that value, which CNE calculated as approximately 20 million ($27 million) for 2007 2008 and an amount to be determined for the first half of 2009. In September 2009, AES Cartagena received invoices for 523,548 (approximately $694,000) for the allowances granted for free for 2007 and 19,907,248 (approximately $26 million) for 2008. In July 2010, AES Cartagena received an invoice for approximately 5.4 million ($7 million) for the allowances granted for free for the first half of 2009. AES Cartagena does not expect to be charged for CO2 allowances issued free of charge for subsequent periods. AES Cartagena has paid the amounts invoiced and has filed challenges to the CNEs demands in the Spanish judicial system. There can be no assurances that the challenges will be successful. AES Cartagena has demanded indemnification from its fuel supply and electricity toller, GDF Suez, in relation to the CNE invoices under the long term energy agreement (the Energy Agreement) with GDF Suez. However, GDF Suez has disputed that it is responsible for the CNE invoices under the Energy Agreement. Therefore, in September 2009, AES Cartagena initiated arbitration against GDF Suez, seeking to recover the payments made to CNE. In the arbitration, AES Cartagena also seeks a determination that GDF Suez is responsible for procuring and bearing the cost of CO2 allowances that are required to offset the CO2 emissions of AES Cartagenas power plant, which is also in dispute between the parties. To date, AES Cartagena has paid approximately 20 million ($27 million) for the CO2 allowances that have been required to offset 2008 and 2009 CO2 emissions. AES Cartagena expects that allowances will need to be purchased to offset emissions for subsequent years. The evidentiary hearing in the arbitration took place from May 31 June 4, 2010, and closing arguments were heard on September 1, 2010. In February 2011, the arbitral tribunal requested further briefing from the parties on certain issues in the arbitration. If AES Cartagena does not prevail in the arbitration and is required to bear the cost of carbon compliance, its results of operations could be materially adversely affected and, in turn, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company and its results of operations. AES Cartagena believes it has meritorious claims and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. In September 2009, the Public Defenders Office of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (PDO) filed a class action against AES Sul in the 16th District Court of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (District Court), claiming that AES Sul has been illegally passing PIS and COFINS taxes (taxes based on AES Suls income) to consumers. According to ANEELs Order No. 93/05, the federal laws of Brazil, and the Brazilian Constitution, energy companies such as AES Sul are entitled to highlight PIS and COFINS taxes in power bills to final consumers, as the cost of those taxes is included in the energy tariffs that are applicable to final consumers. Before AES Sul had 105 Table of Contents been served with the action, the District Court dismissed the lawsuit in October 2009 on the ground that AES Sul had been properly highlighting PIS and COFINS taxes in consumer bills in accordance with Brazilian law. In April 2010, the PDO appealed to the Appellate Court of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (AC). In November 2010, the AC affirmed the dismissal. The PDO is expected to appeal. If the dismissal is ever reversed and AES Sul does not prevail in the lawsuit and is ordered to cease recovering PIS and COFINS taxes pursuant to its energy tariff, its potential prospective losses could be approximately R$9.6 million ($6 million) per month, as estimated by AES Sul. In addition, if AES Sul is ordered to reimburse consumers, its potential retrospective liability could be approximately R$1.2 billion ($718 million), as estimated by AES Sul. AES Sul believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings if it is served with the action; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in its efforts. Furthermore, if AES Sul does not prevail in the litigation it will seek to adjust its energy tariff to compensate it for its losses, but there can be no assurances that it would be successful in obtaining an adjusted energy tariff. In October 2009, IPL received a Notice of Violation (NOV) and Finding of Violation from EPA pursuant to CAA Section 113(a). The NOV alleges violations of the CAA at IPLs three coal fired electric generating facilities dating back to 1986. The alleged violations primarily pertain to EPAs Prevention of Significant Deterioration and nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) requirements under the CAA. Since receiving the letter, IPL management has met with EPA staff and is currently in discussions with the EPA regarding possible resolutions to this NOV. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of similar cases have required companies to pay civil penalties and to install additional pollution control technology on coal fired electric generating units. A similar outcome in this case could have a material impact to IPL and could, in turn, have a material impact on the Company. IPL would seek recovery through customer rates of any operating or capital expenditures related to pollution control technology systems to reduce regulated air emissions; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in that regard. In November 2009, April 2010 and December 2010, substantially similar personal injury lawsuits were filed by a total of 26 residents and estates in the Dominican Republic against the Company, AES Atlantis, Inc., AES Puerto Rico, LP, AES Puerto Rico, Inc., and AES Puerto Rico Services, Inc., in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware. In each lawsuit the plaintiffs allege that the coal combustion byproducts of AES Puerto Ricos power plant were illegally placed in the Dominican Republic in October 2003 through March 2004 and subsequently caused the plaintiffs birth defects, other personal injuries, and or deaths. The plaintiffs do not quantify their alleged damages, but generally allege that they are entitled to compensatory and punitive damages. The AES defendants have moved for partial dismissal of both the November 2009 and April 2010 lawsuits on various grounds. (The AES Defendants have until mid February to respond to the December 2010 lawsuit.) In September 2010, the Superior Court heard arguments on the motions. The Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs fraud allegations without prejudice to replead, and the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in November 2010. The AES defendants have filed a renewed motion to dismiss the amended issues. The remaining claims (other than fraud) addressed in the AES defendants original motion to dismiss are still pending. The AES defendants believe they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts. On December 21, 2010, AES 3C Maritza East 1 EOOD, which owns an unfinished 670MW lignite fired power plant in Bulgaria, made the first in a series of demands on the performance bond securing the construction Contractors obligations under the parties EPC Contract. The Contractor failed to complete the plant on schedule. The total amount demanded by Maritza under the performance bond is approximately 155 million ($205 million). However, the Contractor obtained a temporary injunction from a French court preventing the issuing bank from honoring the bond demands. As the performance bond is governed by English law, Maritza obtained a judgment from an English court that the bond should be paid, and then presented this judgment to the French court which issued the temporary injunction. However, on February 10, 2011, the French court issued a decision enjoining the issuing bank from honoring the demands on the performance bond pending the determination of the arbitration between Maritza and the Contractor, described below. Maritza is attempting to 106 Table of Contents lift that injunction or otherwise obtain payment on its demands. In addition, in December 2010, the Contractor issued a notice of dispute alleging that the lignite that has been supplied by Maritza for commissioning of the power plant is out of specification, allegedly entitling the Contractor to an extension of time to complete the power plant, an increase to the contract price of approximately 62 million ($82 million), and other relief. The Contractor thereafter advised Maritza that it had stopped commissioning of the power plants two units because of the characteristics of the lignite supplied, and, in January 2011, initiated arbitration on its lignite claim. Maritza disputes that the lignite is out of specification and intends to defend the arbitration and assert counterclaims for delay liquidated damages and other relief relating to the Contractors failure to complete the power plant and other breaches of the EPC contract. Maritza believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. ITEM 4. REMOVED AND RESERVED 107 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On March 12, 2010, the Company and Terrific Investment Corporation (Investor), a wholly owned subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, entered into a stockholder agreement (the Stockholder Agreement) in connection with the agreement discussed in the following paragraph. Under the Stockholder Agreement, as long as Investor holds more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, Investor will have the right to designate one nominee, who must be reasonably acceptable to the Board, for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. Investor has not designated its nominee for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, until such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock, Investor has agreed to vote its shares in accordance with the recommendation of the Company on any matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company relating to the election of directors and compensation matters. Otherwise, Investor may vote its shares at its discretion. Further, under the Stockholder Agreement, Investor will be subject to a standstill restriction which generally prohibits Investor from purchasing additional securities of the Company beyond the level acquired by it under the stock purchase agreement entered into between Investor and the Company on November 6, 2009. In addition, Investor has agreed to a lock up restriction such that Investor would not sell its shares for a period of 12 months following the closing, subject to certain exceptions. The standstill and lock up restrictions also terminate at such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock. Investor will have certain registration rights and preemptive rights under the Stockholder Agreement with respect to its shares of common stock of the Company. On March 15, 2010, the Company completed the sale of 125,468,788 shares of common stock to Investor. The shares were sold for $12.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.58 billion. Investors ownership in the Companys common stock is now approximately 15% of the Companys total outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers In July 2010, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $500 million of AES common stock. The Board authorization permits the Company to repurchase stock through a variety of methods, including open market repurchases and or privately negotiated transactions. The original authorization was set to expire on December 31, 2010, however; in December 2010, the Board authorized an extension of the stock repurchase program. There can be no assurance as to the amount, timing or prices of repurchases, which may vary based on market conditions and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2010, shares of common stock repurchased under this plan totaled 8,382,825 at a total cost of $99 million plus a nominal amount of commissions (average of $11.86 per share including commissions). There was $401 million remaining under the stock repurchase program available for future repurchases at December 31, 2010. 108 Table of Contents The following table presents information regarding purchases made by The AES Corporation of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2010: Repurchase Period Total Numberof SharesPurchased Average PricePaid per Share Total Number of SharesRepurchased as Partof a Publicly AnnouncedRepurchase Plan Dollar Value of MaximumNumber of Shares To BePurchased Under the Plan 10/1/10 10/31/10 6,086,345 $ 12.30 6,086,345 $ 409,713,649 11/1/10 11/30/10 $ $ 409,713,649 12/1/10 12/31/10 755,000 $ 11.89 755,000 $ 400,732,931 Total 6,841,345 $ 12.26 6,841,345 Market Information Our common stock is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol AES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business We are a global power company. We operate two primary lines of business. The first is our Generation business, where we own and or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities, other intermediaries and certain end users. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our Generation and Utilities businesses comprised approximately 45% and 55% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We are also continuing to expand our wind and solar generation businesses. These initiatives are not material contributors to our operating results at this time, but we believe that certain of these initiatives may become material in the future. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10 K. Our Organization and Segments. Our management reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively EMEA), each managed by a regional president. The financial reporting segment structure uses our management reporting structure as its foundation and reflects how we manage the business internally. Based on our application of the segment reporting accounting guidance, which provides certain quantitative thresholds and aggregation criteria, we have concluded that the Company has the following six reportable segments: Latin America Generation; Latin America Utilities; North America Generation; North America Utilities; Europe Generation; Asia Generation. We report the Companys Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation, Wind Generation and Climate Solutions operating segments within Corporate and Other because they do not meet the criteria to allow for aggregation with another operating segment or the quantitative thresholds that would require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. None of these operating segments are currently material to our financial statement presentation of reportable segments, individually or in the aggregate. Corporate and Other also includes corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments and other intercompany charges such as self insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company modified its internal reporting structure to move the management of the Companys generation business in Jordan, Amman East, from Asia to Europe. Accordingly, Amman East is now reported within the Europe Generation segment. All prior periods have been retrospectively restated to reflect this change and conform to current period presentation. Key Drivers of Our Results of Operations. Our Generation and Utilities businesses are distinguished by the nature of their customers, operational differences, cost structure, regulatory environment and risk exposure. As a result, each line of business has slightly different drivers which affect operating results. Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other things, plant reliability and efficiency, power prices, volume, 113 Table of Contents management of fixed and variable operating costs, management of working capital including collection of receivables, and the extent to which our plants have hedged their exposure to currency and commodities such as fuel. For our Generation businesses which sell power under short term contracts or in the spot market, the most crucial factors are the current market price of electricity and the marginal costs of production. Growth in our Generation business is largely tied to securing new PPAs, expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building or acquiring new power plants. Performance drivers for our Utilities businesses include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; management of working capital, including collection of receivables; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive regulatory requirements; and in developing countries, reduction of commercial and technical losses. The operating results of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth and weather conditions in areas in which they operate. In addition to these drivers, as further explained below, the Company also has exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. One of the key factors which affect our Generation business is our ability to enter into contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of fuel used to produce that electricity. Long term contracts are intended to reduce exposure to volatility associated with fuel prices in the market and the price of electricity by fixing the revenue and costs for these businesses. The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. In turn, most of these businesses enter into long term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. While these long term contractual agreements reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel, the predictability of operating results and cash flows vary by business based on the extent to which a facilitys generation capacity and fuel requirements are contracted and the negotiated terms of these agreements. Entering into these contracts exposes us to counterparty credit risk. For further discussion of these risks, see Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. When fuel costs increase, many of our businesses are able to pass these costs on to their customers. Generation businesses with long term contracts in place do this by including fuel pass through or fuel indexing arrangements in their contracts. Utilities businesses can pass costs on to their customers through increases in current or future tariff rates. Therefore, in a rising fuel cost environment, the increased fuel costs for these businesses often result in an increase in revenue to the extent these costs can be passed through (though not necessarily on a one for one basis). Conversely, in a declining fuel cost environment, the decreased fuel costs can result in a decrease in revenue. Increases or decreases in revenue at these businesses that have the ability to pass through costs to the customer have a corresponding impact on cost of sales, to the extent the costs can be passed through, resulting in a limited impact on gross margin, if any. Although these circumstances may not have a large impact on gross margin, they can significantly affect gross margin as a percentage of revenue. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of revenue is a less relevant measure when evaluating our operating performance. To the extent our businesses are unable to pass through fuel cost increases to their customers, gross margin may be adversely affected. Global diversification also helps us mitigate risk. Our presence in mature markets helps mitigate the exposure associated with our businesses in emerging markets. Additionally, our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, water (hydroelectric power), wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. However, to the extent the mix of fuel sources enabling our generation capabilities in any one market is not diversified, the spread in costs of different fuels or the availability of natural resources such as water for hydroelectric power production or wind may also influence the operating performance and the ability of our subsidiaries to compete within that market. For example, in a market where gas prices fall to a low level compared to coal prices, power prices may be set by low gas prices which can affect the profitability of our coal plants in that market. In certain cases, we may attempt to hedge fuel prices to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, we only hedge a 114 Table of Contents portion of our currency and commodity risks, and our businesses are still subject to these risks, as further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. Commodity and power price volatility could continue to impact our financial metrics to the extent this volatility is not hedged. For a discussion of our sensitivities to commodity, currency and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Form 10 K. Due to our global presence, the Company has significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure is primarily associated with the impact of the translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results from their local currency to U.S. Dollars that is required for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, there is foreign currency transaction exposure when an entity enters into transactions, including debt agreements, in currencies other than their functional currency. These risks are further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. During 2010, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a significant impact on our operating results. If the current foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues, our gross margin and other financial metrics could continue to be affected. Another key driver of our results is our ability to bring new businesses into commercial operation successfully. We currently have approximately 1,300 MW of projects under construction in eight countries. Our prospects for improved operating results and cash flows are dependent upon successful completion of these projects on time and within budget. However, as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties, construction is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with site identification, financing, permitting and our ability to meet construction deadlines. Delays or the inability to complete projects and commence commercial operations can result in increased costs, impairment of assets and other challenges involving partners and counterparties to our construction agreements, PPAs and other agreements. Our gross margin is also impacted by the fact that in each country in which we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity, and environmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business. Regulations differ on a country by country basis (and even at the state and local municipality levels) and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country, and affect many aspects of our operations and development projects. Our ability to negotiate tariffs, enter into long term contracts, pass through costs related to capital expenditures and otherwise navigate these regulations can have an impact on our revenue, costs and gross margin. Environmental and land use regulations, including existing and proposed regulation of GHG emissions, could substantially increase our capital expenditures or other compliance costs, which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. For a further discussion of the Regulatory Environment, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments Environmental, included in Item 8. Financial Statements, Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated with Government Regulation and Laws of this Form 10 K. Key Drivers of Results in 2010 In 2010, the Companys gross margin and cash flow from operations increased $531 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, while net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million compared to the prior year. During 2010, our North American generation businesses continued to face challenges associated with relatively lower gas prices and a decline in power prices relative to coal and other fuel. In particular, lower gas and power prices have affected the generation volume and financial results of our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas which are merchant businesses and not subject to PPAs. We expect 115 Table of Contents this trend to continue. In 2010, these challenges were partially mitigated by hedging arrangements. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Impairments below. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Despite these challenges, many of our financial measures have improved when compared to 2009. Gross margin increased due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation caused by a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies in 2010 and better operating performance at certain businesses. For instance, certain of the Companys Latin American businesses experienced continued increases in market demand due to the local economic recovery in Latin America. The Company also benefited from higher demand and favorable market conditions at Masinloc, our generation business in the Philippines. Masinlocs higher availability enabled the Company to benefit from increased contract and spot market sales and favorable market prices in the Philippines. In addition, cash provided by operating activities increased due to the improved operating results at Latin America generation businesses and Masinloc; contributions from the consolidation of Cartagena and the Ballylumford acquisition in 2010; and changes in working capital in Latin America. Despite the increase in gross margin in 2010, net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased primarily from the impact of long lived asset impairments recognized related to four businesses: Eastern Energy in New York, Southland in California, Tisza II in Hungary and Deepwater in Texas. These were partially offset by gains from the sale of our discontinued businesses in Oman and Qatar and a decrease in goodwill impairment charges. In 2011, we expect to face continued challenges in our business, including the trends in North America described above. In addition, the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and commodity prices on our operations may continue into 2011. In 2011, the components of the tariff reset in Brazil and its potential impact on our Brazilian utilities are uncertain at this time and we expect continued challenges in our merchant businesses such as those in the U.S., Hungary and Northern Ireland. However, management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses and growth from new businesses acquired, that commenced operations in 2010 or are expected to commence operations in 2011, may lessen or offset the impact of these challenges described above, as they did in 2010. However, if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described above or elsewhere in this section impact us more than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our gross margin and net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In addition, we do not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. Such cash flows may be influenced by the operating challenges presented above and will also not include the cash flows from operations which were sold in 2010 or the increases experienced from the cash flows provided by the initial consolidation of Cartagena, the acquisition of Ballylumford and several working capital transactions at our Latin American utilities in 2010 as discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity. The following briefly describes the key changes in our reported revenue, gross margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, Adjusted Earnings per Share (a non GAAP measure) and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Results of Operations and Segment Analysis discussion within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. 116 Table of Contents Performance Highlights Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 Gross Margin $ 3,964 $ 3,433 $ 3,568 Net Income Attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share from Continuing Operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (a non GAAP measure)(1) $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 3,510 $ 2,202 $ 2,160 (1) See reconciliation and definition below under Non GAAP Measure. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue increased $2.7 billion, or 19%, to $16.6 billion in 2010 compared with $14.0 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $805 million; increased volume and rates at our Brazilian utilities attributable to increased demand due to the recovery of the local economy and the favorable impact of the June 2009 tariff reset; the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010; the favorable impact of rates at our generation businesses in Argentina; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; higher demand at Gener in Chile; the impact of the Companys new business in Northern Ireland, acquired in August 2010; and higher demand and rates at Indianapolis Power and Light. Gross margin increased $531 million, or 15%, to $4.0 billion in 2010 compared with $3.4 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $219 million; an increase in demand at our generation and utilities businesses in Latin America; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; and the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs in Latin America, largely driven by bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil in 2009 that did not recur; and lower rates at our generation businesses in New York. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million to $9 million in 2010, compared to $658 million in 2009. Key drivers of the decrease included: Impairment losses in New York related to our Eastern Energy facilities, in California related to our Southland (Huntington Beach) generation facility, in Hungary related to our Tisza II generation facility and in Texas related to our Deepwater facility; 117 Table of Contents A decrease in gain on sale of investments due to the sale of our businesses in Northern Kazakhstan which occurred in 2009; and A decrease in other income due to the reduction in interest and penalties in 2009 associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the Programa de Recuperacao Fiscal (REFIS) program and a favorable court decision in 2009 enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by: The gain on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of Barka which occurred in August 2010; An increase in net equity in earnings of affiliates partially offset by income tax expense related to the sale of the Companys indirect investment in Companhia Energ&eacute;tica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Lower impairment expenses related to a goodwill impairment of our business in Kilroot that occurred in 2009; Lower income tax expense due to 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries; and An increase in gross margin as described above. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion, or 59%, to $3.5 billion in 2010 compared with $2.2 billion in 2009. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $837 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased tax payments in 2009 associated with a tax amnesty program of $326 million, higher working capital requirements during 2009 related to payments on the settlement of swap agreements of $65 million and in 2010, a $50 million decrease in employer contributions to pension plans and lower payments for contingencies; an increase of $215 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to the higher gross margin in 2010 combined with improved working capital mainly as a result of higher collections of value added taxes and accounts receivable; an increase of $99 million at Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher gross margin; and an increase of $58 million as a result of our consolidation of Cartagena in 2010 and the acquisition of Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $136 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations of businesses sold in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of businesses sold was $33 million and will not recur in 2011. In 2010 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities at our Latin American Utilities businesses included several items such as the tax amnesty program and settlement of swap agreements, as described above, that are not expected to recur. In addition, 2010 net cash provided by operating activities benefited from the one time cash savings related to the utilization of tax credits received as a result of the REFIS program. As such, the Company does not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. 118 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue decreased $1.2 billion, or 8%, to $14.0 billion in 2009 compared with $15.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $997 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; decreases in volume at Uruguaiana due to the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold, as well as in New York and Hungary and lower dispatch in Northern Ireland due to unfavorable gas prices compared to coal; the impact of lower spot and contract energy prices at our generation business in Chile; and lower energy prices and volume at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase in tariff rates at our utilities businesses in Latin America primarily reflecting the recovery of energy purchases that were passed through to our customers. Gross margin decreased $135 million, or 4%, to $3.4 billion in 2009 compared with $3.6 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $218 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; lower energy prices and higher purchased energy costs at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic and Argentina; increased pension costs in Brazil and the U.S.; and lower volume in New York due to lower spot market rates. These decreases were partially offset by: improved operating performance at our generation businesses in Chile and the Philippines; higher tariffs in Brazil and El Salvador; and bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $576 million to $658 million in 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: a gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Northern Kazakhstan partially offset by a performance incentive bonus recognized in 2009 for management services provided to these subsidiaries and a settlement upon termination of the management agreement in 2009; the reduction in gross margin in 2009 as described above; and higher impairment expenses in 2009 as a result of an impairment of goodwill at Kilroot in Northern Ireland, and an impairment recognized on our assets in Pakistan which is reflected in discontinued operations, offset by a decline in long lived asset impairment compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by: a reduction in foreign currency transaction losses on net monetary position as a result of reduced losses at our businesses in Chile and the Philippines; a reduction in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates and debt balances in Brazil and favorable foreign currency translation; and lower income tax expenses driven in part by lower pre tax income and a decrease in the effective tax rate from 29% in 2008 to 26% in 2009 due, in part, to tax benefits recorded in 2009 upon the release of 119 Table of Contents valuation allowances at U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recognized in Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. In 2008, the $905 million gain recognized on the sale of our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses had a significant impact on net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In 2009, the Company recognized a performance incentive bonus of $80 million in the first quarter for management services provided to these sold businesses, reflected as other income. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized an additional gain on the sale of the businesses of $98.5 million upon the termination of the management agreement. While the Company engages in the sale of assets and businesses from time to time, the gain or loss recognized in any such sale will depend on a number of factors related to the asset or business that may be sold. Therefore, the Company does not believe that the decline in net income between 2008 and 2009 represents a trend. All of the amounts related to our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses were reported in continuing operations and will not recur in 2010 or future years. Net cash from operating activities increased $42 million, or 2%, to $2.2 billion in 2009 compared with $2.2 billion in 2008. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $238 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to improved working capital management; an increase of $148 million at our Asia Generation businesses due to improved working capital management and improved gross margin; and an increase of $115 million at our Europe Generation businesses primarily due to the collection of the $80 million Kazakhstan management performance incentive bonus in the first quarter 2009. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $391 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased working capital requirements, including the payment of the settlement of a swap agreement, increased tax payments associated with a tax amnesty program and increased payments related to the settlement of contingencies and energy purchases, partially offset by increased operating results; and a decrease of $77 million at our North America Generation businesses, primarily due to reduced operating results. Non GAAP Measure We define adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) mark to market amounts related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) significant gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) significant losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. AES believes that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Companys internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to mark to market gains or losses related to derivative transactions, currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.11 per share. For purposes of measuring loss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be antidilutive. However, for purposes of computing Adjusted 120 Table of Contents EPS (a non GAAP measure), the Company has included the impact of dilutive common stock equivalents as the inclusion of the defined adjustments result in income for Adjusted EPS. The table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in GAAP diluted earnings per share to the weighted average shares used in calculating the non GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Reconciliation of Denominator used for Adjusted Earnings Per Share Loss Shares $ per Share GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Loss from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders $ (86 ) 769 $ (0.11 ) EFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES Stock options 2 Restricted stock units 3 NON GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE $ (86 ) 774 $ (0.11 ) Year Ended December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share 2010 2009 2008 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Derivative mark to market (gains) losses(1) (0.01 ) 0.02 0.05 Currency transaction (gains) losses(2) (0.04 ) (0.04 ) 0.17 Disposition/acquisition (gains) losses (3) (0.19 )(4) (1.27 )(5) Impairment losses 1.07 (6) 0.21 (7) 0.13 (8) Debt retirement (gains) losses 0.03 (9) 0.25 (10) Adjusted earnings per share $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 (1) Derivative mark to market (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (2) Unrealized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (3) The Company has not adjusted for the gain or the related tax effect from the sale of its indirect investment in CEMIG, disclosed in Note 7 Investments in and Advances to Affiliates, in its determination of Adjusted EPS because the gain was recognized by an equity method investee. The Company does not adjust for transactions of its equity method investees in its determination of adjusted EPS. (4) Amount includes: Kazakhstan gain of $98 million, or $0.15 per share, related to the termination of a management agreement as well as a gain of $13 million, or $0.02 per share, related to the reversal of a withholding tax contingency. In addition, there was a gain on sale associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China of $14 million, or $0.02 per share. There were no taxes associated with any of these transactions. (5) Amount includes: Net gain on Kazakhstan sale of $905 million, or $1.31 per share, and net loss on sale of subsidiary interests in Gener of $31 million, or $0.04 per share. There was no income tax impact associated with these transactions. (6) Amount primarily includes asset impairments at Eastern Energy of $827 million, Southland (Huntington Beach) of $200 million, Tisza of $85 million, and Deepwater of $79 million ($537 million, or $0.69 per share, $130 million, or $0.17 per share, $69 million, or $0.09 per share, and $51 million, or $0.07 per share, net of income tax, respectively) and goodwill impairment at Deepwater of $18 million (or $0.02 per share, with no income tax impact). (7) Amount includes: Goodwill impairments at Kilroot of $118 million, or $0.18 per share, and in the Ukraine of $4 million, or $0.01 per share; write off of development project costs in Latin America and Asia of $19 million ($11 million net of noncontrolling interests, or $0.01 per share) and an impairment of $10 million, or $0.01 per share, of the Companys investment in a company developing blue gas (coal to gas) technology. There was no income tax impact associated with any of these transactions. 121 Table of Contents (8) Amount includes: Impairment charges primarily associated with development projects in North America of $75 million ($34 million net of noncontrolling interests and income tax, or $0.06 per share); Uruguaiana asset write down of $36 million ($17 million net of noncontrolling interest, or $0.02 per share); South Africa peaker development cost write off of $31 million ($28 million net of income tax, or $0.04 per share) and a nontaxable impairment of the Companys investment in blue gas (coal to gas) technology of $10 million, or $0.01 per share. Impairment losses are net of an income tax benefit of $0.02 per share in 2008. (9) Amount includes loss on retirement of debt at the Parent Company of $15 million, at Andres of $10 million, and at Itabo of $8 million ($10 million, or $0.01 per share, net of income tax at the Parent Company, $0.01 per share at Andres, and $4 million, or $0.01 per share, net of noncontrolling interest at Itabo). (10) Amount includes: $55 million ($34 million net of income tax, or $0.05 per share) loss on the retirement of Parent Company debt; $131 million, or $0.19 per share, which represented the tax impact on the repatriation of a portion of the Kazakhstan sale proceeds that were used to fund the early retirement of Parent Company debt; and $14 million ($9 million net of income tax, or $0.01 per share) of debt refinancing at IPALCO. Debt retirement (gains) losses are net of an income tax benefit of $0.04 per share in 2008. Managements Priorities Management continues to focus on the following priorities: Execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy including funds received in 2010 from asset and equity sales: investing in value accretive projects; delevering to increase financial flexibility, reduce risk and to create future borrowing capacity; and executing its stock repurchase program; from July through December 2010 we have repurchased a total of $99 million, or approximately 8.4 million shares of AES common stock, at an average price per share of $11.86, including commissions. Improvement of operations in the existing portfolio; Achieve cost savings through the alignment of overhead costs with business requirements, systems automation and optimal allocation of business development spending; Strategic portfolio management of existing projects including restructuring and potential sales of certain North American generation subsidiaries; Completion of an approximately 1,300 MW active construction program on time and within budget; Achieving commercial operation at Maritza in Bulgaria. At the end of 2010, the Company experienced certain commissioning delays, as further described in Key Trends and Uncertainties Development below; and 122 Table of Contents Integration of new projects. During 2010, the following projects were acquired or commenced commercial operations: Project Location Fuel GrossMW AES Equity Interest(Percent, Rounded) Ballylumford United Kingdom Gas 1,246 100 % JHRH(1) China Hydro 379 35 % Nueva Ventanas Chile Coal 272 71 % St. Nikola Bulgaria Wind 156 89 % Guacolda 4(2) Chile Coal 152 35 % Dong Qi(3) China Wind 49 49 % Huanghua II(3) China Wind 49 49 % St. Patrick France Wind 35 100 % North Rhins Scotland Wind 22 100 % Kepezkaya Turkey Hydro 28 51 % Damlapinar(4) Turkey Hydro 16 51 % (1) Jianghe Rural Electrification Development Co.

Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Some of these challenges are also described above in Key Drivers of Results in 2010. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. Development. During the past year, the Company has successfully acquired and completed construction of a number of projects, totaling approximately 2,404 MW, including the acquisition of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom and completion of construction of a number of projects in Europe, Chile and China. However, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties of this Form 10 K, our development projects are subject to uncertainties. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not yet begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, we believe that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this time frame. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results or financial position. Global Economic Conditions. During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Although the economic conditions in several of these countries have improved in recent months, our businesses could be impacted in the event these recent trends do not continue. 123 Table of Contents Our business or results of operations could be impacted if our subsidiaries are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all, are unable to raise funds through the sale of assets or are otherwise unable to finance or refinance their activities. The Company could also be adversely affected if capital market disruptions result in increased borrowing costs (including with respect to interest payments on the Companys or our subsidiaries variable rate debt) or if commodity prices affect the profitability of our plants or their ability to continue operations. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if general economic or political conditions in the markets where our subsidiaries operate deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the availability and or an increase in the cost of capital, or if the value of our assets remain depressed or decline further. Any of the foregoing events or a combination thereof could have a material impact on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, financial covenants, and or its credit rating. Our subsidiaries are subject to credit risk, which includes risk related to the ability of counterparties (such as parties to our PPAs, fuel supply agreements, hedging agreements and other contractual arrangements) to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price or to satisfy their financial or other contractual obligations. The Company has not suffered any material effects related to its counterparties during 2010. However, if macroeconomic conditions impact our counterparties, they may be unable to meet their commitments which could result in the loss of favorable contractual positions, which could have a material impact on our business. In addition, during the past year, certain European countries have faced a sovereign debt crisis and it is possible that other nations could be affected. This crisis has resulted in an increased risk of default by governments and the implementation of austerity measures in countries. If the crisis continues, worsens, or spreads, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company. Our businesses may be impacted if they are unable to access the capital markets, face increased taxes or labor costs, or if governments fail to fulfill their obligations to us or adopt austerity measures which adversely impact our projects. In addition, as noted in the Risk Factor entitled, Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges, our renewables businesses are dependent on favorable regulatory incentives, including subsidies, which are provided by sovereign governments. If these subsidies or other incentives are reduced or repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, in whole or in part, this could impact the ability of the affected businesses to continue to grow their operations. For example, the Spanish government recently issued a decree which limits the feed in tariff and number of photovoltaic hours eligible for the tariff, which could adversely impact AES Solar in Spain. For further information on the decree see Item 1. Regulatory Spain of this Form 10 K. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries. For further information on the importance of long term contracts and our counterparty credit risk, see the Risk Factor from this Form 10 K titled, We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. As a result of any of the foregoing events, we may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. The Companys investment in AES Solar, whose primary operations are in Europe, at December 31, 2010 was $312 million. For a discussion of the risks associated with commodity prices, see We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. It is also possible that commodity or power price volatility could continue to impact our financial results. As noted in Key Drivers of Results in 2010, and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk of this Form 10 K, the Companys North American businesses continue to face pressure as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place, but purchase 124 Table of Contents fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. If these conditions continue or worsen, these businesses may need to restructure their obligations or seek additional funding (including from the Parent) or face the possibility that they may be unable to meet their obligations and continue operations. Presently, Eastern Energy, Deepwater and Thames are seeking to restructure their financial obligations and or place certain of their plants in protective layup status to mitigate operating risks caused by high fuel costs and other competitive pressures. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. The Company presently manages its commodity risk with hedging activities to mitigate earnings volatility. However, at present in North America, dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present an opportunity to engage in additional hedging activity for 2011. As a result, there are hedging arrangements in place for only a relatively small portion of 2011. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. Specifically, the operating results of the Companys Eastern Energy generation business in New York could be adversely impacted by continued higher coal prices relative to electricity prices if hedging continues to be uneconomic. If global economic conditions worsen, it could also affect the rates we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our rates based on prevailing market conditions as PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual rate or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. Impairments. Long lived assets. The global economic conditions and other adverse factors discussed above heighten the risk of a significant asset impairment. Examples of conditions that could be indicative of impairment which would require us to evaluate the recovery of a long lived asset or asset group include: current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset group; a significant adverse change in legal factors, including changes in environmental or other regulations or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used or in its physical condition. As further described in Item 1. Regulatory Matters United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR) had the right to require the termination of the long term PPAs under which Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom, supplies electricity to NIE Energy as early as 2010. One of the conditions to the early termination was 180 days notice, which was provided to Kilroot on April 30, 2010. At March 31, 2010, management evaluated Kilroots long lived assets for potential impairment assuming the early termination of the PPA and concluded that no impairment existed at that time. On October 28, 2010, Kilroot received final notice from NIAUR directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the PPA effective November 1, 2010. Kilroot may not be able to replace the contract on competitive terms and, upon cancellation of the PPA effective November 1, 2010, became a merchant plant. It will operate under the gross mandatory pool of the SEM in Northern Ireland. There have been no additional impairment indicators since March 31, 2010. AES Eastern Energy (AEE) operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. 125 Table of Contents The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated an impairment evaluation of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW petroleum coke (pet coke) fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and a recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 126 Table of Contents 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time, since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and what form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations. This was considered as an impairment indicator for the long lived asset groups. The recoverability test of the long lived asset groups indicated that the carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group exceeded its fair value by $200 million which was recognized as an impairment expense. The carrying amounts of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach long lived asset groups were determined to be recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis at September 30, 2010 and no impairment was necessary. During the third quarter of 2010, we also recognized impairment on the long lived assets at our Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. Tisza II operates under an annual contract with an off taker. In the third quarter of 2010, when Tisza II began the negotiation of its 2011 contract, future undiscounted cash flows of the plant were no longer expected to recover the long lived assets groups carrying amount due to prevailing market rates, higher generation costs and lower demand expectations. Accordingly, the Company measured the fair value of the long lived asset group and recorded an impairment expense of $85 million, representing the excess of carrying amount over the fair value at September 30, 2010. Goodwill. The Company seeks business acquisitions as one of its growth strategies. We have achieved significant growth in the past as a result of several business acquisitions, which also resulted in the recognition of goodwill. As noted in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, there is always a risk that Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. The benefits of goodwill are typically realized through the future operating results of an acquired business. Management believes that the recoverability of goodwill is positively correlated with the economic environments in which our acquired businesses operate and a severe economic downturn could negatively impact the recoverability of goodwill. Also, the evolving environmental regulations, including GHG regulations, around the globe continue to increase the operating costs of our generation businesses. In extreme situations, the environmental regulations could even make a once profitable business uneconomical. In addition, most of our generation businesses have a finite life and as the acquired businesses reach the end of their finite lives, the carrying amount of goodwill is gradually recovered through their periodic operating results. The accounting guidance, however, prohibits the systematic amortization of goodwill and rather requires an annual impairment evaluation. Thus, as some of our acquired businesses approach the end of their finite lives, they may incur goodwill impairment charges even if there are no discrete adverse changes in the economic environment. As noted in Long lived assets above, adverse market conditions at Deepwater were also considered an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. Accordingly, in the second and third quarters of 2010, interim 127 Table of Contents goodwill impairment evaluations were performed at the Deepwater reporting unit level. The reporting unit passed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation in the second quarter and no impairment was recognized. In the third quarter, however, the reporting unit failed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation. Upon measurement of impairment loss in Step 2, the entire $18 million goodwill balance was considered impaired and recognized as goodwill impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation and did not have any reporting units that were considered at risk. A reporting unit is considered at risk when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. While there were no potential impairment indicators that could result in the recognition of goodwill impairment for any of these reporting units, it is possible we may incur goodwill impairment on these reporting units in future years if any of the following events occur: a significant adverse change in business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a sale of assets at less than carrying amount, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, an acquisition not performing as expected, changing environmental regulations that significantly increase the cost of doing business, or a business reaches the end of its finite life. The likelihood of the occurrence of these events may increase because of the challenging global macroeconomic conditions. Regulatory Environment. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter and mercury. For a description of material regulations faced by the Company, see Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies and Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows set forth in this Form 10 K. Recent Events Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company continued to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program announced on July 7, 2010. The Company has repurchased 1,026,610 shares at a cost of $13 million in 2011, bringing the cumulative total through February 22, 2010 to 9,409,435 shares at a total cost of $112 million (average price of $11.92 per share including commissions). As of February 25, 2011, $388 million of the $500 million authorized remained available under the stock repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 14 Equity. On February 1, 2011, AES Thames, LLC (Thames), our 208 MW coal fired plant in Connecticut, filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy is due, in part, to the increased cost of energy production. The bankruptcy protection is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or the results of operations. 128 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, Results of operations 2010 2009 2008 $ change2010 vs. 2009 $ change2009 vs. 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: Latin America Generation $ 4,281 $ 3,651 $ 4,468 $ 630 $ (817 ) Latin America Utilities 7,222 6,092 5,907 1,130 185 North America Generation 1,972 1,940 2,234 32 (294 ) North America Utilities 1,145 1,068 1,079 77 (11 ) Europe Generation 1,362 820 1,143 542 (323 ) Asia Generation 618 375 345 243 30 Corporate and Other(1) 1,066 870 1,012 196 (142 ) Eliminations(2) (1,019 ) (862 ) (991 ) (157 ) 129 Total Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 $ 2,693 $ (1,243 ) Gross Margin: Latin America Generation $ 1,497 $ 1,357 $ 1,398 $ 140 $ (41 ) Latin America Utilities 1,072 918 886 154 32 North America Generation 435 477 660 (42 ) (183 ) North America Utilities 249 239 261 10 (22 ) Europe Generation 268 212 273 56 (61 ) Asia Generation 240 93 (10 ) 147 103 Corporate and Other(3) 186 117 62 69 55 Eliminations(4) 17 20 38 (3 ) (18 ) General and administrative expenses (392 ) (339 ) (368 ) (53 ) 29 Interest expense (1,526 ) (1,485 ) (1,770 ) (41 ) 285 Interest income 411 348 519 63 (171 ) Other expense (239 ) (111 ) (161 ) (128 ) 50 Other income 108 465 375 (357 ) 90 Gain on sale of investments 131 909 (131 ) (778 ) Loss on sale of subsidiary stock (31 ) 31 Goodwill impairment (21 ) (122 ) 101 (122 ) Asset impairment expense (1,221 ) (25 ) (175 ) (1,196 ) 150 Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position (33 ) 33 (184 ) (66 ) 217 Other non operating expense (7 ) (12 ) (15 ) 5 3 Income tax expense (307 ) (599 ) (771 ) 292 172 Net equity in earnings of affiliates 183 92 33 91 59 Income from continuing operations 920 1,809 1,929 (889 ) (120 ) Income from operations of discontinued businesses 75 96 97 (21 ) (1 ) Gain (loss) from disposal of discontinued businesses 64 (150 ) 6 214 (156 ) Net income 1,059 1,755 2,032 (696 ) (277 ) Noncontrolling interests: Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,006 ) (1,099 ) (759 ) 93 (340 ) (Income) loss from discontinuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (44 ) 2 (39 ) (46 ) 41 Net income attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 $ (649 ) $ (576 ) Per Share Data: Basic income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.75 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.69 ) Diluted income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.67 ) (1) Corporate and Other includes revenue from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, Wind Generation and other renewables initiatives.

These increases were partially offset by: lower volume sold at Uruguaiana of $53 million as a result of renegotiation of its power sales agreements; lower volume due to unfavorable hydrology in Colombia and Argentina of $41 million; lower contract prices at Gener of $32 million; and lower contract prices on PPAs indexed to international coal prices in the Dominican Republic of $22 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $106 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $34 million, or 3%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher spot prices in Argentina of $69 million; higher volume and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic of $55 million; higher contract prices of $33 million in Colombia; the positive impact of $28 million resulting from the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana, as mentioned above; and higher volume of $23 million in Panama. These increases were partially offset by: higher fuel and purchased energy prices at Gener of $48 million; the net effect of lower PPA prices and higher fuel costs in the Dominican Republic of $38 million; 130 Table of Contents the impact of a reversal of bad debt expense during the first quarter of 2009 of $36 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of one of its power sales agreements; and higher fixed costs of $30 million at Gener primarily due to higher employee costs, increased maintenance expenses and costs incurred due to construction delays at Campiche. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 17% while gross margin increased 10%, primarily due to higher spot purchases and fuel prices at Gener and the reversal of bad debt expense as a result of the renegotiation of one of the power sales agreements at Uruguaiana in the first quarter of 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $181 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $636 million, or 14%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower spot and contract prices of $295 million at Gener; lower volume of $227 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold; and lower energy prices and volume of $174 million in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: and increase of $100 million due to fewer outages at Gener and in Argentina in 2009; and higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $94 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $53 million, or 4%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;; fewer outages of $60 million at Gener and in Argentina; lower diesel consumption, partially offset by higher energy purchases and higher gas consumption, at Gener of $47 million; lower volume of energy purchased at Uruguaiana of $44 million as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements; and the favorable impact of $28 million of a decrease in bad debt expense at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of lower energy prices of $75 million in the Dominican Republic; lower volume and energy prices of $66 million in Argentina; higher purchased energy prices of $48 million at Uruguaiana; and lower spot sales of $48 million at Panama. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 18% while gross margin decreased 3%, primarily due to reduced energy purchases, fewer outages and lower bad debt expense. 131 Table of Contents Latin America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in Latin America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Latin America Utilities Revenue $ 7,222 $ 6,092 $ 5,907 19 % 3 % Gross Margin $ 1,072 $ 918 $ 886 17 % 4 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $697 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2010 increased $433 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $316 million, primarily in Brazil, due to increased market demand; and higher tariffs of $114 million primarily related to the July 2009 tariff reset in Brazil partially offset by the unfavorable impact on rates at Eletropaulo in Brazil of a cumulative adjustment to regulatory liabilities and higher energy prices across our Latin America utility businesses associated with energy purchases passed through to customers of $97 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $107 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $47 million, or 5%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $163 million, primarily in Brazil, due to the increased market demand; and lower contingencies of $142 million in Eletropaulo primarily related to labor contingencies which included a one time reversal, reflecting an agreement with Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o CESP, the pension plan administrator, of $51 million associated with claims for past benefit obligations which will now be accounted for as a component of the pension plan. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $238 million primarily due to the recovery in 2009 of a municipality receivable previously written off in Brazil and higher salaries and other employee related costs, provisions for commercial losses, regulatory penalties and maintenance costs; and $28 million related to the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $442 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2009 increased $627 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $560 million reflecting the recovery of energy purchases of $453 million that were passed through to customers at our utilities in Brazil and El Salvador; and higher volume in Brazil of $62 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $62 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2009 increased $94 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $107 million in El Salvador and Brazil; a $64 million recovery of a municipality receivable previously written off; 132 Table of Contents a non recurring PIS/COFINS fine in 2008 of $33 million; and higher volume of $32 million across the region. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of higher fixed costs of $120 million mainly related to pension expense, labor contingencies and maintenance costs in Brazil. North America Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Generation Revenue $ 1,972 $ 1,940 $ 2,234 2 % 13 % Gross Margin $ 435 $ 477 $ 660 9 % 28 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $19 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $13 million, or 1%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased rates, volume and an availability bonus at TEG/TEP in Mexico of $41 million; higher volume, primarily due to fewer outages and higher rates, of $22 million at Merida in Mexico; higher volume of $19 million at Warrior Run in Maryland due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. These increases were partially offset by: a net decrease of $50 million in New York due to lower rates partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a net decrease of $18 million at Deepwater in Texas primarily due to lower volume; and a net decrease of $14 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3 million, generation gross margin for 2010 decreased $45 million, or 9%, from 2009 primarily due to: a net decrease of $94 million in New York due to lower rates and higher coal prices partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a decrease of $16 million at Deepwater due to lower volume and rates; a net decrease of $11 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage; a decrease of $9 million in Hawaii due to an unfavorable impact of mark to market derivatives; and a decrease of $7 million in Puerto Rico due to higher fixed costs. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase of $39 million in New York primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of lower contract and maintenance costs, and other employee related costs; 133 Table of Contents a net increase of $26 million at TEG/TEP due to a current year availability bonus and fewer outages partially offset by higher fuel prices; higher volume of $14 million at Warrior Run due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 2% while gross margin decreased 9%, primarily due to the change in rates in New York having a greater impact on gross margin than revenue. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $44 million, primarily in Mexico, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $250 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $107 million in New York due to a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a decrease of $80 million due to a reduction in natural gas prices at Merida; increased outages of $22 million, $21 million and $17 million at Warrior Run, TEG/TEP and New York, respectively; lower rates of $20 million at Deepwater; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives in New York of $11 million; and the unfavorable impact in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $9 million, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $174 million, or 26%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $72 million in New York driven by a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a $29 million unfavorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments on coal supply contracts in Hawaii as a result of a gain of $22 million in 2008 compared to a loss of $7 million in 2009; an increase in outages of $22 million and $6 million at Warrior Run and in New York, respectively; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives of $11 million and higher emission allowance purchases of $13 million in New York; and the unfavorable impact of $9 million in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 13% while gross margin decreased 28%, primarily due to the increase in coal prices in New York and the unfavorable impact of derivatives in 2009 in Hawaii that had no corresponding impact on revenue. 134 Table of Contents North America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Utilities Revenue $ 1,145 $ 1,068 $ 1,079 7 % 1 % Gross Margin $ 249 $ 239 $ 261 4 % 8 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Utilities revenue for 2010 increased $77 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail demand of $64 million as a result of warmer weather and higher fuel adjustment charges; and increased wholesale revenue of $11 million primarily due to higher prices. Utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $10 million, or 4%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail margin of $20 million due to increased demand; lower pension expense of $12 million; and lower emission allowance expense of $5 million. These increases were partially offset by: increased maintenance expenses of $16 million due to the timing of major generating unit overhauls; and increased fixed costs of $14 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 7% while gross margin increased 4%, primarily due to increased fuel and maintenance costs. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Utilities revenue for 2009 decreased $11 million, or 1%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower retail volume of $31 million due primarily to milder weather and the economic recession; and decreased wholesale revenue of $7 million driven by lower market prices. These decreases were partially offset by: $32 million of voluntary credits IPL provided to retail customers in 2008. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters North America of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these credits. Utilities gross margin for 2009 decreased $22 million, or 8%, from 2008 primarily due to: decreased wholesale margin of $16 million due to unfavorable prices; and increased pension expense of $25 million largely due to the decline in market value of IPLs pension assets during 2008. 135 Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by: increased retail margin of $15 million, primarily due to the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, partially offset by lower retail sales volumes in 2009; and decreased property tax expense of $5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 1% while gross margin decreased 8%, primarily due to the $25 million increase in pension expense and the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, both of which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. Europe Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Europe for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Europe Generation Revenue $ 1,362 $ 820 $ 1,143 66 % 28 % Gross Margin $ 268 $ 212 $ 273 26 % 22 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $41 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $583 million, or 71%, from 2009 primarily due to: $409 million from the adoption of new accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) which resulted in the consolidation of Cartagena in Spain, a generation business previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting; $117 million from the operations of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom, which was acquired in August 2010; $16 million from a full year of combined cycle operations at our Amman East plant in Jordan, which was single cycle until August 2009; higher tariffs of $16 million at Altai in Kazakhstan; higher volume of $15 million at Kilroot in the United Kingdom largely driven by coal pass through and increased demand, partially offset by lower capacity revenue due to the termination of the long term PPA and related supplementary agreements. These increases were partially offset by: lower volume and sales of emissions allowances in Hungary of $16 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $1 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $57 million, or 27%, from 2009 primarily due to: $62 million from the consolidation of Cartagena as discussed above; higher tariffs and lower fixed costs at Altai of $29 million; and $13 million from the operations of Ballylumford since its acquisition. 136 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: lower gross margin of $28 million primarily from the termination of the long term PPA at Kilroot; and lower gross margin of $20 million in Hungary primarily attributable to higher fuel costs that could not be passed through and lower sales of emission allowances. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 66% while gross margin increased 26%, primarily due to the consolidation of Cartagena and acquisition of Ballylumford that have a larger positive impact on revenue than gross margin, and the positive impact of higher energy revenue at Kilroot, which as a pass through had no corresponding impact on gross margin. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $146 million, driven mainly by Kilroot, Hungary and Kazakhstan, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $177 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower revenue of $101 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower volume of $81 million in Hungary due to the combined impact of the cancellation of one of our PPAs and reduced demand; and lower volume of $67 million at Kilroot, a coal fired plant, mainly driven by lower dispatch due to favorable gas prices compared to coal. These decreases were partially offset by: the benefit of new business of $50 million at Amman East, which commenced single cycle operations in July 2008; and higher rates of $15 million in Kazakhstan. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $35 million, driven mainly by Kilroot and Kazakhstan, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $26 million, or 10%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower gross margin of $41 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower demand of $12 million in Hungary; and an overall increase of $22 million in fixed costs across the region. These decreases were partially offset by: higher capacity revenue at Kilroot; higher energy prices in Kazakhstan; and the benefit of new business at Amman East. Asia Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Asia for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Asia Generation Revenue $ 618 $ 375 $ 345 65 % 9 % Gross Margin $ 240 $ 93 $ (10 ) 158 % 1030 % 137 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $28 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $215 million, or 57%, from 2009 primarily due to: favorable generation rates and volume of $210 million at Masinloc in the Philippines as a result of increased market demand and improved plant availability subsequent to the completion of its overhaul at the beginning of 2010; and higher demand from both new and existing contract and spot customers as a result of lower supply shortages in the Philippines power market due to a strong energy growth rate. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $13 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $134 million, or 144%, from 2009 primarily due to a combination of higher availability attributable to improved plant operations, higher market demand and favorable spot prices at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 65% while gross margin increased 158%, primarily due to the positive influence on gross margin due to favorable spot rates and operational efficiencies resulting from the Masinloc plant overhauls in late 2009 and early 2010, which led to higher availability and allowed for more efficient operations that have materially improved the operating results for 2010 as compared to 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $23 million, primarily in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, generation revenue for 2009 increased $53 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: the benefit of $46 million of our new business Masinloc, which was acquired in April 2008; increased revenue of $70 million in 2009 at Masinloc due to improved rates and volume as a result of improved availability and new customer contracts; and $18 million from a one time favorable energy sales settlement at Masinloc. These increases were partially offset by: the decrease in revenue of $71 million at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka primarily due to a decline in fuel costs which are largely passed through to the customer and higher outages in 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by higher capacity revenue. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $6 million, primarily in the Philippines, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $109 million, or 1,090%, from 2008 primarily due to: the impact of our new business at Masinloc of $23 million; a $91 million increase at Masinloc due to higher contract sales, where margins are more favorable than spot sales, lower fuel prices, improved availability and the favorable energy sales settlement described above; and higher capacity revenue at Kelanitissa of $10 million. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $20 million at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue increased 9% while gross margin increased 1,030%, primarily due to higher contract margins at Masinloc as a result of improved operations, availability and lower fuel prices, as well as the larger relative impact on gross margin from the one time favorable energy sales settlement described above. 138 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Corporate and other includes the net operating results from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, AES Wind Generation and renewables projects which are immaterial for the purposes of separate segment disclosure. The following table excludes inter segment activity and summarizes revenue and gross margin for Corporate and Other entities for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Revenue Europe Utilities $ 356 $ 286 $ 403 24 % 29 % Africa Utilities 422 370 379 14 % 2 % Africa Generation 61 65 65 6 % 0 % Wind Generation 202 133 128 52 % 4 % Corp/Other 25 16 37 56 % 57 % Total Corporate and Other $ 1,066 $ 870 $ 1,012 23 % 14 % Gross Margin Europe Utilities $ 21 $ 16 $ 34 31 % 53 % Africa Utilities 65 71 30 8 % 137 % Africa Generation 54 41 28 32 % 46 % Wind Generation 44 11 19 300 % 42 % Corp/Other 2 (22 ) (49 ) 109 % 55 % Total Corporate and Other $ 186 $ 117 $ 62 59 % 89 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $30 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other revenue increased $226 million for 2010, or 26% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: higher volume at our utility businesses in Ukraine driven by an overall increase in market demand; higher volume and utility tariffs at Sonel in Cameroon driven by an increase in market demand; and incremental revenue from new wind generation projects that commenced operations during the year and an overall volume increase across our wind businesses. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $8 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $77 million for 2010, or 66% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: an increase in gross margin from our new wind generation projects and higher volume, as discussed above; and an increase in volume at Dibamba, our generation business, in Cameroon. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs at Sonel. 139 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $162 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other revenue increased $20 million for 2009, or 2%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: higher tariffs in Ukraine of $27 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $12 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $67 million for 2009, or 108%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: a decrease in fixed costs across the Africa region. The increase was partially offset by: higher fuel consumption attributable to lower hydrology at Sonel. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense includes those expenses related to corporate and region staff functions and or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems, and development costs. General and administrative expenses increased $53 million, or 16%, to $392 million in 2010 from 2009. The increase is primarily related to business development costs associated with increased development efforts, primarily in Europe, Turkey and India. General and administrative expenses decreased $29 million, or 8%, to $339 million in 2009 from 2008. The decrease is primarily related to 2008 professional fees associated with remediation efforts and a reduction in business development costs. The favorable variance is partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the worldwide implementation of SAP. Interest expense Interest expense increased $41 million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to interest expense at Cartagena which is now a consolidated entity, higher interest rates at Tiet&ecirc;, increased debt principal at Eletropaulo and interest being expensed related to St. Nikola, our wind project in Bulgaria, due to commencement of operations in 2010. These increases were partially offset by reduced debt principal at the Parent Company. Interest expense decreased $285 million, or 16%, to $1.5 billion in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates globally due to economic conditions and inflationary adjustments to the market price index in Brazil. In addition, interest expense decreased as a result of favorable foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil and lower interest expenses associated with decreased debt balances at Eletropaulo. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense at Masinloc in the Philippines which was acquired in April 2008, and interest expense at Infovias in Brazil where a fee on a non exercised credit line was written off. Interest income Interest income increased $63 million, or 18%, to $411 million in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to a higher average balance in short term investments at Eletropaulo and the favorable impact of 140 Table of Contents foreign currency translation in Brazil as well as the settlement of a dispute related to inflation adjustments for energy sales at Tiet&ecirc;. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest income from a loan to a wind development project in Brazil which was repaid in June 2010. Interest income decreased $171 million, or 33%, to $348 million in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances in Brazil, unfavorable foreign currency translation in Brazil, the impact of decreased interest rates and inflationary adjustments on accounts receivable in 2008 at Gener in Chile and a decreased cash balance at the Parent Company. Other income Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Gain on extinguishment of tax and other liabilities $ 65 $ 168 $ 199 Tax credit settlement 129 Performance incentive fee 80 Insurance proceeds 40 Gain on sale of assets 12 14 34 Other 31 74 102 Total other income $ 108 $ 465 $ 375 Other income of $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to the extinguishment of a swap liability owed by two of our Brazilian subsidiaries, resulting in the recognition of a $62 million gain. The net impact to the Company after taxes and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Other income also included a gain on sale of assets at Eletropaulo. Other income of $465 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $165 million from the reduction in interest and penalties associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the REFIS program and a $129 million gain related to a favorable court decision enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. The net impact to the Company after income taxes and noncontrolling interests for these items was $44 million. In addition, the Company recognized income in 2009 of $80 million from a performance incentive bonus for management services provided to Ekibastuz and Maikuben in 2008. The management agreement was related to the sale of these businesses in Kazakhstan in May 2008; see further discussion of this transaction in Note 22 Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Other income of $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included gains on the extinguishment of a gross receipts tax liability and a legal contingency at Eletropaulo of $117 million and $75 million, respectively, $32 million of cash proceeds related to a favorable legal settlement at Southland in California, $29 million of insurance recoveries for damaged turbines at Uruguaiana, $23 million of gains associated with a sale of land at Eletropaulo and sales of turbines at Itabo, and compensation of $18 million for the impairment associated with the settlement agreement to shut down Hefei. 141 Table of Contents Other expense Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Loss on sale and disposal of assets $ 84 $ 42 $ 34 Gener gas settlement 72 Loss on extinguishment of debt 37 70 AES Wind transaction costs 22 Other 24 69 57 Total other expense $ 239 $ 111 $ 161 Other expense of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $72 million for a settlement agreement of gas transportation contracts at Gener. There were also previously capitalized transaction costs of $22 million that were incurred in connection with the preparation for the sale of a noncontrolling interest in our Wind Generation business which were written off upon the expiration of the letter of intent in June 2010. In addition, there were losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo, Panama, and Gener, an $18 million loss on debt extinguishment at Andres and Itabo and a $15 million loss at the Parent Company from the retirement of senior notes. Other expense of $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $13 million loss recognized when three of our businesses in the Dominican Republic received $110 million par value bonds issued by the Dominican Republic government to settle existing accounts receivable for the same amount from the government owned distribution companies. The loss represented an adjustment to reflect the fair value of the bonds on the date received. Other expense also included losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo and Andres and contingencies at our businesses in Kazakhstan and Alicura in Argentina. Other expense of $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $69 million of losses on the retirement of debt at the Parent Company in connection with the refinancing in June 2008 and IPALCO associated with a $375 million refinancing in April 2008 and losses on disposal of assets primarily at Eletropaulo. Goodwill Impairment In 2010, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2010, Deepwater, our pet coke fired merchant generation facility in Texas, determined that there was an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. This determination was primarily based on managements decision not to operate the plant for more than 30 days in the third quarter of 2010, current operating and cash flow losses, and forecasted operating and cash flow losses for the remainder of 2010 through 2014 as a result of declining trends in energy pricing curves and increasing pet coke prices. As a result, Deepwater recognized a goodwill impairment of $18 million. Deepwater is reported in the North America Generation segment. In 2009, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $122 million. This was a result of impairment at certain of our businesses in the United Kingdom and Ukraine as a result of the Companys annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of October 1. The most significant goodwill impairment was at Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom. Factors contributing to the recognition of impairment included: reduced profit expectations based on latest estimates of future commodity prices and reduced expectations on the recovery of cash flows on the existing plant following the Companys decision to forgo capital expenditures to meet emission allowance requirements taking effect in 2024. The fair value of the Companys reporting units are inherently sensitive to the assumptions underlying the estimates of fair value. Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Fair Value, Goodwill and Intangibles in Item 8 of this Form 10 K provides a 142 Table of Contents more detailed discussion of those assumptions. As discussed in Key Trends and Uncertainties, in the future, the fair values of the Companys reporting units might decline as a result of adverse changes in their operating environments or the businesses reaching the end of their finite lives, which could require the Company to record additional goodwill impairment charges. The Company did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2008. Asset Impairment Expense As discussed in Note 19 Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, asset impairment expense for the year 2010 was $1,221 million and consisted primarily of the following: Eastern Energy AEE operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated a recoverability test of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Southland In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and the exact form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process 143 Table of Contents through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations and the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. The Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment. The asset group was determined to be at the individual plant level and based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined that the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the Huntington Beach asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying value of the Huntington Beach plant of $288 million exceeded the fair value of $88 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $200 million. The undiscounted cash flows of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach generation facilities exceeded their respective carrying values and resulted in no impairment. Huntington Beach is reported in the North America Generation reportable segment. Tisza II During the third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into annual negotiations with the offtaker of its Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. As a result of these preliminary negotiations, as well as the further deterioration of the economic environment in Hungary, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. Thus, the Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and determined that based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount of the Tisza II asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The carrying value of the Tisza II asset group of $160 million exceeded the fair value of $75 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $85 million. Tisza II is reported in the Europe Generation reportable segment. Deepwater In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW pet coke fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, 144 Table of Contents all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Asset impairment expense for the year 2009 was $25 million. In 2009, the Company recognized a pre tax long lived asset impairment charge of $11 million related to the Companys Piabanha hydro project in Brazil. The Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows and abandoned the project. Asset impairment expense for the year 2008 was $175 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, the Company reviewed and prioritized projects in the development pipeline. From this review, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows for certain projects. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $75 million ($34 million, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes) related to two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non power development project at one of our facilities in North America. During 2008, the Company recognized additional impairment charges of $36 million related to long lived assets at Uruguaiana. The impairment was triggered by a combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy in 2007 that continued in 2008. Following an initial impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, further charges were incurred in 2008 due to fixed asset purchase agreements in place. During the first half of 2008, the Company withdrew from projects in South Africa and Israel which resulted in impairment charges of $36 million. The Company also recognized an impairment of $18 million related to the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China. Gain on sale of investments There was no gain on sale of investments in 2010. Gain on sale of investments of $131 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $98 million recognized in May 2009 related to the termination of the management agreement between the Company and Kazakhmys PLC for Ekibastuz and Maikuben, a gain of $14 million from the sale of the remaining assets associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China and $13 million from the reversal of a contingent liability related to the Kazakhstan sale in 2008. Gain on sale of investments of $909 million in 2008 consisted primarily of the sale in May 2008 of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Ekibastuz and Maikuben for a net gain of $905 million. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock There was no loss on sale of subsidiary stock in 2010 or 2009. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock of $31 million in 2008 was the result of sales of AES Gener shares made by our wholly owned subsidiary Cachagua. In November 2008, Cachagua sold 9.6% of its ownership in Gener to a third party reducing its ownership in Gener to 70.6%. 145 Table of Contents Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Companys net monetary position from foreign currency transaction activities: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) AES Corporation $ (50 ) $ 13 $ 38 Chile 8 65 (96 ) Philippines 8 15 (57 ) Brazil (6 ) (9 ) (44 ) Argentina 12 (10 ) (28 ) Kazakhstan 1 (24 ) 14 Colombia (4 ) (11 ) 5 Other (2 ) (6 ) (16 ) Total(1) $ (33 ) $ 33 $ (184 ) (1) Includes (losses) gains of $(10) million, $(39) million and $10 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These losses consisted primarily of losses at The AES Corporation partially offset by gains in Argentina. Losses of $50 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the devaluation of notes receivable resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound, and losses on foreign exchange swaps and options, partially offset by gains on cash balances and debt denominated in British Pounds. Gains of $12 million in Argentina were primarily due to a gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso by 5%, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These gains consisted primarily of gains in Chile, the Philippines and at The AES Corporation partially offset by losses in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. Gains of $65 million in Chile were primarily due to the appreciation of the Chilean Peso of 20% resulting in gains at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Peso, mainly cash and accounts receivables. This gain was partially offset by $14 million in losses on foreign currency derivatives. Gains of $15 million in the Philippines were primarily due to the appreciation of the Philippine Peso of 3%, resulting in gains at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on the remeasurement of U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $13 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the settlement of the senior unsecured credit facility and the revaluation of notes receivable denominated in the Euro, partially offset by losses on debt denominated in British Pounds. Losses of $24 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar and $12 million of foreign currency transaction losses on debt and other liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Kazakh Tenge. 146 Table of Contents Losses of $11 million in Colombia were primarily due to the appreciation of the Colombian Peso of 9%, resulting in losses at Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its Colombian Peso denominated debt and losses on foreign currency derivatives. Losses of $10 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2009, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt, partially offset by derivative gains. Losses of $9 million in Brazil were primarily due to energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar, resulting in foreign currency transaction losses of $18 million, partially offset by gains of $9 million due to the appreciation in 2009 of the Brazilian Real of 25%, resulting in gains at Sul and Uruguaiana associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These losses consisted primarily of losses in Chile, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina partially offset by gains at The AES Corporation and in Kazakhstan. Losses of $96 million in Chile were primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso of 28% in 2008, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable and value added tax (VAT) receivables. Losses of $57 million in the Philippines were primarily due to remeasurement losses at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on U.S. Dollar denominated debt resulting from depreciation of the Philippine Peso of 14% in 2008. Losses of $44 million in Brazil were primarily due to the realization of deferred exchange variance on past energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar. Losses of $28 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2008, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $38 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to debt denominated in British Pounds and gains on foreign exchange derivatives, partially offset by losses on notes receivable denominated in the Euro. Gains of $14 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction gains of $16 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar, offset by $5 million of foreign currency transaction losses on external and intercompany debt denominated in other than the Kazakh Tenge functional currency. Income taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $292 million, or 49%, to $307 million in 2010. The Companys effective tax rates were 29% for 2010 and 26% for 2009. The net increase in the 2010 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 relating to the CEMIG sale transaction, tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowances at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, and $165 million of non taxable income recorded in 2009 at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program. These items were offset by income tax benefits related to a reversal of withholding tax liabilities at certain Chilean subsidiaries and 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries. Included in the net tax expense related to the CEMIG sale transaction is tax expense on the equity earnings associated with the reversal of the net long term liability and tax benefit related to release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. 147 Table of Contents Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $172 million, or 22%, to $599 million in 2009. The Companys effective tax rates were 26% for 2009 and 29% for 2008. The net decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowance at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recorded at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $91 million, or 99%, to $183 million in 2010 from $92 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a gain recognized upon the sale of our interest in CEMIG during the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by 2009 equity in earnings of Cartagena which was accounted for as a consolidated entity in 2010 and thus reported directly within revenues and expenses. Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $59 million, or 179%, to $92 million in 2009 from $33 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a cash settlement received by Cartagena, in Spain, in June 2009 for liquidated damages received related to a construction delay from December 2005 to November 2006; increased earnings at Guacolda in Chile mainly due to lower cost of coal; increased earnings of Chigen affiliates from higher tariffs partially offset by lower volume and a valuation write off in 2008 at an affiliate in Turkey. These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings at OPGC, in India, mainly due to lower tariff and a dividend distribution tax in March 2009 and increased expenses for an equipment overhaul at Elsta in the Netherlands. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $93 million, or 8%, to $1.0 billion in 2010 from $1.1 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreased earnings at Eletropaulo as a result of the absence of legal settlement income present in 2009, a loss on legal settlement at Gener and reduced revenues due to decreased coal prices along with higher electricity purchases at Itabo. These decreases were partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian Real. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $340 million, or 45%, to $1.1 billion in 2009 from $0.8 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to increases in gross margin and other income, lower interest expense and a decrease in impairments in 2009 at our Brazilian businesses, and increases in gross margin and foreign currency transaction gains at our businesses in Chile. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $44 million at certain of our wind generation businesses as a result of a charge related to the potential future taxes that could be deemed due in the calculation of the hypothetical liquidation value of certain of our wind tax equity partnerships. Discontinued operations As further discussed in Note 21 Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Businesses to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, Discontinued Operations includes the results of five businesses: Ras Laffan, a generation business in Qatar (sold in October 2010); Barka, a generation business in Oman, (sold in August 2010); Lal Pir and Pak Gen, generation businesses in Pakistan, (sold in June 2010); and Jiaozuo, a generation business in China, (sold in December 2008). Prior periods have been restated to reflect these businesses within Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. In 2010, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $39 million and reflected the operations of our 55% stake in Ras Laffan, a combined cycle gas facility and water desalination plant in Qatar, our 35% stake in Barka, a combined cycle gas 148 Table of Contents facility and water desalination plant in Oman and our 55% stake in Lal Pir and Pak Gen, two oil fired facilities in Pakistan. The sale of Lal Pir and Pak Gen closed in June 2010, resulting in additional impairment expense and a loss on the sale in 2010 of $14 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The Barka plant was sold in August 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $63 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The sale of Ras Laffan closed in October 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $6 million, net of tax. In 2009, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $54 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir and Pak Gen. Loss on disposal of discontinued businesses, net of tax and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $105 million and represented the difference between the net book value of the Companys interests in its Pakistan businesses and their estimated fair value. In 2008, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $60 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir, Pak Gen and Jiaozuo, a coal fired generation facility in China sold in December 2008. The Company received $73 million for its 70% interest in the business. The net gain on the disposition was $7 million. Critical Accounting Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Companys most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Reserves We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the tax jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material. 149 Table of Contents On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act). The Act includes several provisions which provide for tax relief for businesses by extending certain tax benefits and credits, including the Subpart F exception for active financing income and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look through provisions of Subpart F. This legislation resulted in a benefit for the Companys 2010 provision for income taxes; however, there can be no assurances that the benefits of this legislation will extend beyond 2011, when it is currently scheduled to expire. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Goodwill and Other Intangibles and Long lived Assets, respectively, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level on October 1. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying amount. A long lived asset (asset group) will be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e., the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are less than its carrying amount. In the event that the carrying amount of the long lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment evaluation is performed, in which the fair value of the asset is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. Examples of indicators that would result in an impairment test for goodwill and a recoverability test for long lived assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate, legislation changes or a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition. Throughout the impairment evaluation process, management makes considerable judgments; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part of an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost/benefit analysis and the Companys internal valuation knowledge of the long lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the DCF model), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factors expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. 150 Table of Contents A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Managements Discussion and Analysis, Consolidated Results of Operations Goodwill Impairment and Asset Impairment Expense and Note 19 Impairment Expense and Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Fair Value Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent), derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long term liabilities. The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Companys investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Companys derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where 151 Table of Contents derivatives qualify and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Companys interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Companys derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterpartys) and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Platts). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instruments fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on indicative pricing quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities The Company adopted the fair value measurement accounting guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009. The most significant of these estimates surround the fair value measurement of long lived tangible and intangible assets when tested for impairment upon a triggering event or during the annual impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill. These estimates include making assumptions regarding useful life, the impact of economic obsolescence and expected future cash flows. Additional factors are discussed above in the Impairments section. 152 Table of Contents Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard creates a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business We are a global power company. We operate two primary lines of business. The first is our Generation business, where we own and or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities, other intermediaries and certain end users. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our Generation and Utilities businesses comprised approximately 45% and 55% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We are also continuing to expand our wind and solar generation businesses. These initiatives are not material contributors to our operating results at this time, but we believe that certain of these initiatives may become material in the future. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10 K. Our Organization and Segments. Our management reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively EMEA), each managed by a regional president. The financial reporting segment structure uses our management reporting structure as its foundation and reflects how we manage the business internally. Based on our application of the segment reporting accounting guidance, which provides certain quantitative thresholds and aggregation criteria, we have concluded that the Company has the following six reportable segments: Latin America Generation; Latin America Utilities; North America Generation; North America Utilities; Europe Generation; Asia Generation. We report the Companys Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation, Wind Generation and Climate Solutions operating segments within Corporate and Other because they do not meet the criteria to allow for aggregation with another operating segment or the quantitative thresholds that would require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. None of these operating segments are currently material to our financial statement presentation of reportable segments, individually or in the aggregate. Corporate and Other also includes corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments and other intercompany charges such as self insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company modified its internal reporting structure to move the management of the Companys generation business in Jordan, Amman East, from Asia to Europe. Accordingly, Amman East is now reported within the Europe Generation segment. All prior periods have been retrospectively restated to reflect this change and conform to current period presentation. Key Drivers of Our Results of Operations. Our Generation and Utilities businesses are distinguished by the nature of their customers, operational differences, cost structure, regulatory environment and risk exposure. As a result, each line of business has slightly different drivers which affect operating results. Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other things, plant reliability and efficiency, power prices, volume, 113 Table of Contents management of fixed and variable operating costs, management of working capital including collection of receivables, and the extent to which our plants have hedged their exposure to currency and commodities such as fuel. For our Generation businesses which sell power under short term contracts or in the spot market, the most crucial factors are the current market price of electricity and the marginal costs of production. Growth in our Generation business is largely tied to securing new PPAs, expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building or acquiring new power plants. Performance drivers for our Utilities businesses include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; management of working capital, including collection of receivables; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive regulatory requirements; and in developing countries, reduction of commercial and technical losses. The operating results of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth and weather conditions in areas in which they operate. In addition to these drivers, as further explained below, the Company also has exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. One of the key factors which affect our Generation business is our ability to enter into contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of fuel used to produce that electricity. Long term contracts are intended to reduce exposure to volatility associated with fuel prices in the market and the price of electricity by fixing the revenue and costs for these businesses. The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. In turn, most of these businesses enter into long term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. While these long term contractual agreements reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel, the predictability of operating results and cash flows vary by business based on the extent to which a facilitys generation capacity and fuel requirements are contracted and the negotiated terms of these agreements. Entering into these contracts exposes us to counterparty credit risk. For further discussion of these risks, see Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. When fuel costs increase, many of our businesses are able to pass these costs on to their customers. Generation businesses with long term contracts in place do this by including fuel pass through or fuel indexing arrangements in their contracts. Utilities businesses can pass costs on to their customers through increases in current or future tariff rates. Therefore, in a rising fuel cost environment, the increased fuel costs for these businesses often result in an increase in revenue to the extent these costs can be passed through (though not necessarily on a one for one basis). Conversely, in a declining fuel cost environment, the decreased fuel costs can result in a decrease in revenue. Increases or decreases in revenue at these businesses that have the ability to pass through costs to the customer have a corresponding impact on cost of sales, to the extent the costs can be passed through, resulting in a limited impact on gross margin, if any. Although these circumstances may not have a large impact on gross margin, they can significantly affect gross margin as a percentage of revenue. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of revenue is a less relevant measure when evaluating our operating performance. To the extent our businesses are unable to pass through fuel cost increases to their customers, gross margin may be adversely affected. Global diversification also helps us mitigate risk. Our presence in mature markets helps mitigate the exposure associated with our businesses in emerging markets. Additionally, our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, water (hydroelectric power), wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. However, to the extent the mix of fuel sources enabling our generation capabilities in any one market is not diversified, the spread in costs of different fuels or the availability of natural resources such as water for hydroelectric power production or wind may also influence the operating performance and the ability of our subsidiaries to compete within that market. For example, in a market where gas prices fall to a low level compared to coal prices, power prices may be set by low gas prices which can affect the profitability of our coal plants in that market. In certain cases, we may attempt to hedge fuel prices to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, we only hedge a 114 Table of Contents portion of our currency and commodity risks, and our businesses are still subject to these risks, as further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. Commodity and power price volatility could continue to impact our financial metrics to the extent this volatility is not hedged. For a discussion of our sensitivities to commodity, currency and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Form 10 K. Due to our global presence, the Company has significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure is primarily associated with the impact of the translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results from their local currency to U.S. Dollars that is required for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, there is foreign currency transaction exposure when an entity enters into transactions, including debt agreements, in currencies other than their functional currency. These risks are further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. During 2010, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a significant impact on our operating results. If the current foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues, our gross margin and other financial metrics could continue to be affected. Another key driver of our results is our ability to bring new businesses into commercial operation successfully. We currently have approximately 1,300 MW of projects under construction in eight countries. Our prospects for improved operating results and cash flows are dependent upon successful completion of these projects on time and within budget. However, as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties, construction is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with site identification, financing, permitting and our ability to meet construction deadlines. Delays or the inability to complete projects and commence commercial operations can result in increased costs, impairment of assets and other challenges involving partners and counterparties to our construction agreements, PPAs and other agreements. Our gross margin is also impacted by the fact that in each country in which we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity, and environmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business. Regulations differ on a country by country basis (and even at the state and local municipality levels) and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country, and affect many aspects of our operations and development projects. Our ability to negotiate tariffs, enter into long term contracts, pass through costs related to capital expenditures and otherwise navigate these regulations can have an impact on our revenue, costs and gross margin. Environmental and land use regulations, including existing and proposed regulation of GHG emissions, could substantially increase our capital expenditures or other compliance costs, which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. For a further discussion of the Regulatory Environment, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments Environmental, included in Item 8. Financial Statements, Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated with Government Regulation and Laws of this Form 10 K. Key Drivers of Results in 2010 In 2010, the Companys gross margin and cash flow from operations increased $531 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, while net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million compared to the prior year. During 2010, our North American generation businesses continued to face challenges associated with relatively lower gas prices and a decline in power prices relative to coal and other fuel. In particular, lower gas and power prices have affected the generation volume and financial results of our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas which are merchant businesses and not subject to PPAs. We expect 115 Table of Contents this trend to continue. In 2010, these challenges were partially mitigated by hedging arrangements. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Impairments below. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Despite these challenges, many of our financial measures have improved when compared to 2009. Gross margin increased due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation caused by a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies in 2010 and better operating performance at certain businesses. For instance, certain of the Companys Latin American businesses experienced continued increases in market demand due to the local economic recovery in Latin America. The Company also benefited from higher demand and favorable market conditions at Masinloc, our generation business in the Philippines. Masinlocs higher availability enabled the Company to benefit from increased contract and spot market sales and favorable market prices in the Philippines. In addition, cash provided by operating activities increased due to the improved operating results at Latin America generation businesses and Masinloc; contributions from the consolidation of Cartagena and the Ballylumford acquisition in 2010; and changes in working capital in Latin America. Despite the increase in gross margin in 2010, net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased primarily from the impact of long lived asset impairments recognized related to four businesses: Eastern Energy in New York, Southland in California, Tisza II in Hungary and Deepwater in Texas. These were partially offset by gains from the sale of our discontinued businesses in Oman and Qatar and a decrease in goodwill impairment charges. In 2011, we expect to face continued challenges in our business, including the trends in North America described above. In addition, the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and commodity prices on our operations may continue into 2011. In 2011, the components of the tariff reset in Brazil and its potential impact on our Brazilian utilities are uncertain at this time and we expect continued challenges in our merchant businesses such as those in the U.S., Hungary and Northern Ireland. However, management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses and growth from new businesses acquired, that commenced operations in 2010 or are expected to commence operations in 2011, may lessen or offset the impact of these challenges described above, as they did in 2010. However, if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described above or elsewhere in this section impact us more than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our gross margin and net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In addition, we do not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. Such cash flows may be influenced by the operating challenges presented above and will also not include the cash flows from operations which were sold in 2010 or the increases experienced from the cash flows provided by the initial consolidation of Cartagena, the acquisition of Ballylumford and several working capital transactions at our Latin American utilities in 2010 as discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity. The following briefly describes the key changes in our reported revenue, gross margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, Adjusted Earnings per Share (a non GAAP measure) and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Results of Operations and Segment Analysis discussion within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. 116 Table of Contents Performance Highlights Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 Gross Margin $ 3,964 $ 3,433 $ 3,568 Net Income Attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share from Continuing Operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (a non GAAP measure)(1) $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 3,510 $ 2,202 $ 2,160 (1) See reconciliation and definition below under Non GAAP Measure. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue increased $2.7 billion, or 19%, to $16.6 billion in 2010 compared with $14.0 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $805 million; increased volume and rates at our Brazilian utilities attributable to increased demand due to the recovery of the local economy and the favorable impact of the June 2009 tariff reset; the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010; the favorable impact of rates at our generation businesses in Argentina; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; higher demand at Gener in Chile; the impact of the Companys new business in Northern Ireland, acquired in August 2010; and higher demand and rates at Indianapolis Power and Light. Gross margin increased $531 million, or 15%, to $4.0 billion in 2010 compared with $3.4 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $219 million; an increase in demand at our generation and utilities businesses in Latin America; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; and the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs in Latin America, largely driven by bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil in 2009 that did not recur; and lower rates at our generation businesses in New York. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million to $9 million in 2010, compared to $658 million in 2009. Key drivers of the decrease included: Impairment losses in New York related to our Eastern Energy facilities, in California related to our Southland (Huntington Beach) generation facility, in Hungary related to our Tisza II generation facility and in Texas related to our Deepwater facility; 117 Table of Contents A decrease in gain on sale of investments due to the sale of our businesses in Northern Kazakhstan which occurred in 2009; and A decrease in other income due to the reduction in interest and penalties in 2009 associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the Programa de Recuperacao Fiscal (REFIS) program and a favorable court decision in 2009 enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by: The gain on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of Barka which occurred in August 2010; An increase in net equity in earnings of affiliates partially offset by income tax expense related to the sale of the Companys indirect investment in Companhia Energ&eacute;tica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Lower impairment expenses related to a goodwill impairment of our business in Kilroot that occurred in 2009; Lower income tax expense due to 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries; and An increase in gross margin as described above. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion, or 59%, to $3.5 billion in 2010 compared with $2.2 billion in 2009. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $837 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased tax payments in 2009 associated with a tax amnesty program of $326 million, higher working capital requirements during 2009 related to payments on the settlement of swap agreements of $65 million and in 2010, a $50 million decrease in employer contributions to pension plans and lower payments for contingencies; an increase of $215 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to the higher gross margin in 2010 combined with improved working capital mainly as a result of higher collections of value added taxes and accounts receivable; an increase of $99 million at Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher gross margin; and an increase of $58 million as a result of our consolidation of Cartagena in 2010 and the acquisition of Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $136 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations of businesses sold in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of businesses sold was $33 million and will not recur in 2011. In 2010 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities at our Latin American Utilities businesses included several items such as the tax amnesty program and settlement of swap agreements, as described above, that are not expected to recur. In addition, 2010 net cash provided by operating activities benefited from the one time cash savings related to the utilization of tax credits received as a result of the REFIS program. As such, the Company does not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. 118 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue decreased $1.2 billion, or 8%, to $14.0 billion in 2009 compared with $15.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $997 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; decreases in volume at Uruguaiana due to the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold, as well as in New York and Hungary and lower dispatch in Northern Ireland due to unfavorable gas prices compared to coal; the impact of lower spot and contract energy prices at our generation business in Chile; and lower energy prices and volume at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase in tariff rates at our utilities businesses in Latin America primarily reflecting the recovery of energy purchases that were passed through to our customers. Gross margin decreased $135 million, or 4%, to $3.4 billion in 2009 compared with $3.6 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $218 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; lower energy prices and higher purchased energy costs at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic and Argentina; increased pension costs in Brazil and the U.S.; and lower volume in New York due to lower spot market rates. These decreases were partially offset by: improved operating performance at our generation businesses in Chile and the Philippines; higher tariffs in Brazil and El Salvador; and bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $576 million to $658 million in 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: a gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Northern Kazakhstan partially offset by a performance incentive bonus recognized in 2009 for management services provided to these subsidiaries and a settlement upon termination of the management agreement in 2009; the reduction in gross margin in 2009 as described above; and higher impairment expenses in 2009 as a result of an impairment of goodwill at Kilroot in Northern Ireland, and an impairment recognized on our assets in Pakistan which is reflected in discontinued operations, offset by a decline in long lived asset impairment compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by: a reduction in foreign currency transaction losses on net monetary position as a result of reduced losses at our businesses in Chile and the Philippines; a reduction in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates and debt balances in Brazil and favorable foreign currency translation; and lower income tax expenses driven in part by lower pre tax income and a decrease in the effective tax rate from 29% in 2008 to 26% in 2009 due, in part, to tax benefits recorded in 2009 upon the release of 119 Table of Contents valuation allowances at U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recognized in Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. In 2008, the $905 million gain recognized on the sale of our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses had a significant impact on net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In 2009, the Company recognized a performance incentive bonus of $80 million in the first quarter for management services provided to these sold businesses, reflected as other income. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized an additional gain on the sale of the businesses of $98.5 million upon the termination of the management agreement. While the Company engages in the sale of assets and businesses from time to time, the gain or loss recognized in any such sale will depend on a number of factors related to the asset or business that may be sold. Therefore, the Company does not believe that the decline in net income between 2008 and 2009 represents a trend. All of the amounts related to our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses were reported in continuing operations and will not recur in 2010 or future years. Net cash from operating activities increased $42 million, or 2%, to $2.2 billion in 2009 compared with $2.2 billion in 2008. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $238 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to improved working capital management; an increase of $148 million at our Asia Generation businesses due to improved working capital management and improved gross margin; and an increase of $115 million at our Europe Generation businesses primarily due to the collection of the $80 million Kazakhstan management performance incentive bonus in the first quarter 2009. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $391 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased working capital requirements, including the payment of the settlement of a swap agreement, increased tax payments associated with a tax amnesty program and increased payments related to the settlement of contingencies and energy purchases, partially offset by increased operating results; and a decrease of $77 million at our North America Generation businesses, primarily due to reduced operating results. Non GAAP Measure We define adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) mark to market amounts related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) significant gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) significant losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. AES believes that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Companys internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to mark to market gains or losses related to derivative transactions, currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.11 per share. For purposes of measuring loss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be antidilutive. However, for purposes of computing Adjusted 120 Table of Contents EPS (a non GAAP measure), the Company has included the impact of dilutive common stock equivalents as the inclusion of the defined adjustments result in income for Adjusted EPS. The table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in GAAP diluted earnings per share to the weighted average shares used in calculating the non GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Reconciliation of Denominator used for Adjusted Earnings Per Share Loss Shares $ per Share GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Loss from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders $ (86 ) 769 $ (0.11 ) EFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES Stock options 2 Restricted stock units 3 NON GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE $ (86 ) 774 $ (0.11 ) Year Ended December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share 2010 2009 2008 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Derivative mark to market (gains) losses(1) (0.01 ) 0.02 0.05 Currency transaction (gains) losses(2) (0.04 ) (0.04 ) 0.17 Disposition/acquisition (gains) losses (3) (0.19 )(4) (1.27 )(5) Impairment losses 1.07 (6) 0.21 (7) 0.13 (8) Debt retirement (gains) losses 0.03 (9) 0.25 (10) Adjusted earnings per share $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 (1) Derivative mark to market (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (2) Unrealized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (3) The Company has not adjusted for the gain or the related tax effect from the sale of its indirect investment in CEMIG, disclosed in Note 7 Investments in and Advances to Affiliates, in its determination of Adjusted EPS because the gain was recognized by an equity method investee. The Company does not adjust for transactions of its equity method investees in its determination of adjusted EPS. (4) Amount includes: Kazakhstan gain of $98 million, or $0.15 per share, related to the termination of a management agreement as well as a gain of $13 million, or $0.02 per share, related to the reversal of a withholding tax contingency. In addition, there was a gain on sale associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China of $14 million, or $0.02 per share. There were no taxes associated with any of these transactions.

Managements Priorities Management continues to focus on the following priorities: Execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy including funds received in 2010 from asset and equity sales: investing in value accretive projects; delevering to increase financial flexibility, reduce risk and to create future borrowing capacity; and executing its stock repurchase program; from July through December 2010 we have repurchased a total of $99 million, or approximately 8.4 million shares of AES common stock, at an average price per share of $11.86, including commissions. Improvement of operations in the existing portfolio; Achieve cost savings through the alignment of overhead costs with business requirements, systems automation and optimal allocation of business development spending; Strategic portfolio management of existing projects including restructuring and potential sales of certain North American generation subsidiaries; Completion of an approximately 1,300 MW active construction program on time and within budget; Achieving commercial operation at Maritza in Bulgaria. At the end of 2010, the Company experienced certain commissioning delays, as further described in Key Trends and Uncertainties Development below; and 122 Table of Contents Integration of new projects.

Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Some of these challenges are also described above in Key Drivers of Results in 2010. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. Development. During the past year, the Company has successfully acquired and completed construction of a number of projects, totaling approximately 2,404 MW, including the acquisition of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom and completion of construction of a number of projects in Europe, Chile and China. However, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties of this Form 10 K, our development projects are subject to uncertainties. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not yet begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, we believe that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this time frame. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results or financial position. Global Economic Conditions. During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Although the economic conditions in several of these countries have improved in recent months, our businesses could be impacted in the event these recent trends do not continue. 123 Table of Contents Our business or results of operations could be impacted if our subsidiaries are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all, are unable to raise funds through the sale of assets or are otherwise unable to finance or refinance their activities. The Company could also be adversely affected if capital market disruptions result in increased borrowing costs (including with respect to interest payments on the Companys or our subsidiaries variable rate debt) or if commodity prices affect the profitability of our plants or their ability to continue operations. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if general economic or political conditions in the markets where our subsidiaries operate deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the availability and or an increase in the cost of capital, or if the value of our assets remain depressed or decline further. Any of the foregoing events or a combination thereof could have a material impact on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, financial covenants, and or its credit rating. Our subsidiaries are subject to credit risk, which includes risk related to the ability of counterparties (such as parties to our PPAs, fuel supply agreements, hedging agreements and other contractual arrangements) to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price or to satisfy their financial or other contractual obligations. The Company has not suffered any material effects related to its counterparties during 2010. However, if macroeconomic conditions impact our counterparties, they may be unable to meet their commitments which could result in the loss of favorable contractual positions, which could have a material impact on our business. In addition, during the past year, certain European countries have faced a sovereign debt crisis and it is possible that other nations could be affected. This crisis has resulted in an increased risk of default by governments and the implementation of austerity measures in countries. If the crisis continues, worsens, or spreads, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company. Our businesses may be impacted if they are unable to access the capital markets, face increased taxes or labor costs, or if governments fail to fulfill their obligations to us or adopt austerity measures which adversely impact our projects. In addition, as noted in the Risk Factor entitled, Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges, our renewables businesses are dependent on favorable regulatory incentives, including subsidies, which are provided by sovereign governments. If these subsidies or other incentives are reduced or repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, in whole or in part, this could impact the ability of the affected businesses to continue to grow their operations. For example, the Spanish government recently issued a decree which limits the feed in tariff and number of photovoltaic hours eligible for the tariff, which could adversely impact AES Solar in Spain. For further information on the decree see Item 1. Regulatory Spain of this Form 10 K. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries. For further information on the importance of long term contracts and our counterparty credit risk, see the Risk Factor from this Form 10 K titled, We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. As a result of any of the foregoing events, we may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. The Companys investment in AES Solar, whose primary operations are in Europe, at December 31, 2010 was $312 million. For a discussion of the risks associated with commodity prices, see We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. It is also possible that commodity or power price volatility could continue to impact our financial results. As noted in Key Drivers of Results in 2010, and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk of this Form 10 K, the Companys North American businesses continue to face pressure as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place, but purchase 124 Table of Contents fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. If these conditions continue or worsen, these businesses may need to restructure their obligations or seek additional funding (including from the Parent) or face the possibility that they may be unable to meet their obligations and continue operations. Presently, Eastern Energy, Deepwater and Thames are seeking to restructure their financial obligations and or place certain of their plants in protective layup status to mitigate operating risks caused by high fuel costs and other competitive pressures. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. The Company presently manages its commodity risk with hedging activities to mitigate earnings volatility. However, at present in North America, dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present an opportunity to engage in additional hedging activity for 2011. As a result, there are hedging arrangements in place for only a relatively small portion of 2011. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. Specifically, the operating results of the Companys Eastern Energy generation business in New York could be adversely impacted by continued higher coal prices relative to electricity prices if hedging continues to be uneconomic. If global economic conditions worsen, it could also affect the rates we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our rates based on prevailing market conditions as PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual rate or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. Impairments. Long lived assets. The global economic conditions and other adverse factors discussed above heighten the risk of a significant asset impairment. Examples of conditions that could be indicative of impairment which would require us to evaluate the recovery of a long lived asset or asset group include: current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset group; a significant adverse change in legal factors, including changes in environmental or other regulations or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used or in its physical condition. As further described in Item 1. Regulatory Matters United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR) had the right to require the termination of the long term PPAs under which Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom, supplies electricity to NIE Energy as early as 2010. One of the conditions to the early termination was 180 days notice, which was provided to Kilroot on April 30, 2010. At March 31, 2010, management evaluated Kilroots long lived assets for potential impairment assuming the early termination of the PPA and concluded that no impairment existed at that time. On October 28, 2010, Kilroot received final notice from NIAUR directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the PPA effective November 1, 2010. Kilroot may not be able to replace the contract on competitive terms and, upon cancellation of the PPA effective November 1, 2010, became a merchant plant. It will operate under the gross mandatory pool of the SEM in Northern Ireland. There have been no additional impairment indicators since March 31, 2010. AES Eastern Energy (AEE) operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. 125 Table of Contents The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated an impairment evaluation of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW petroleum coke (pet coke) fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and a recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 126 Table of Contents 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time, since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and what form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations. This was considered as an impairment indicator for the long lived asset groups. The recoverability test of the long lived asset groups indicated that the carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group exceeded its fair value by $200 million which was recognized as an impairment expense. The carrying amounts of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach long lived asset groups were determined to be recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis at September 30, 2010 and no impairment was necessary. During the third quarter of 2010, we also recognized impairment on the long lived assets at our Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. Tisza II operates under an annual contract with an off taker. In the third quarter of 2010, when Tisza II began the negotiation of its 2011 contract, future undiscounted cash flows of the plant were no longer expected to recover the long lived assets groups carrying amount due to prevailing market rates, higher generation costs and lower demand expectations. Accordingly, the Company measured the fair value of the long lived asset group and recorded an impairment expense of $85 million, representing the excess of carrying amount over the fair value at September 30, 2010. Goodwill. The Company seeks business acquisitions as one of its growth strategies. We have achieved significant growth in the past as a result of several business acquisitions, which also resulted in the recognition of goodwill. As noted in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, there is always a risk that Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. The benefits of goodwill are typically realized through the future operating results of an acquired business. Management believes that the recoverability of goodwill is positively correlated with the economic environments in which our acquired businesses operate and a severe economic downturn could negatively impact the recoverability of goodwill. Also, the evolving environmental regulations, including GHG regulations, around the globe continue to increase the operating costs of our generation businesses. In extreme situations, the environmental regulations could even make a once profitable business uneconomical. In addition, most of our generation businesses have a finite life and as the acquired businesses reach the end of their finite lives, the carrying amount of goodwill is gradually recovered through their periodic operating results. The accounting guidance, however, prohibits the systematic amortization of goodwill and rather requires an annual impairment evaluation. Thus, as some of our acquired businesses approach the end of their finite lives, they may incur goodwill impairment charges even if there are no discrete adverse changes in the economic environment. As noted in Long lived assets above, adverse market conditions at Deepwater were also considered an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. Accordingly, in the second and third quarters of 2010, interim 127 Table of Contents goodwill impairment evaluations were performed at the Deepwater reporting unit level. The reporting unit passed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation in the second quarter and no impairment was recognized. In the third quarter, however, the reporting unit failed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation. Upon measurement of impairment loss in Step 2, the entire $18 million goodwill balance was considered impaired and recognized as goodwill impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation and did not have any reporting units that were considered at risk. A reporting unit is considered at risk when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. While there were no potential impairment indicators that could result in the recognition of goodwill impairment for any of these reporting units, it is possible we may incur goodwill impairment on these reporting units in future years if any of the following events occur: a significant adverse change in business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a sale of assets at less than carrying amount, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, an acquisition not performing as expected, changing environmental regulations that significantly increase the cost of doing business, or a business reaches the end of its finite life. The likelihood of the occurrence of these events may increase because of the challenging global macroeconomic conditions. Regulatory Environment. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter and mercury. For a description of material regulations faced by the Company, see Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies and Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows set forth in this Form 10 K. Recent Events Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company continued to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program announced on July 7, 2010. The Company has repurchased 1,026,610 shares at a cost of $13 million in 2011, bringing the cumulative total through February 22, 2010 to 9,409,435 shares at a total cost of $112 million (average price of $11.92 per share including commissions). As of February 25, 2011, $388 million of the $500 million authorized remained available under the stock repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 14 Equity. On February 1, 2011, AES Thames, LLC (Thames), our 208 MW coal fired plant in Connecticut, filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy is due, in part, to the increased cost of energy production. The bankruptcy protection is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or the results of operations. 128 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, Results of operations 2010 2009 2008 $ change2010 vs. 2009 $ change2009 vs. 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: Latin America Generation $ 4,281 $ 3,651 $ 4,468 $ 630 $ (817 ) Latin America Utilities 7,222 6,092 5,907 1,130 185 North America Generation 1,972 1,940 2,234 32 (294 ) North America Utilities 1,145 1,068 1,079 77 (11 ) Europe Generation 1,362 820 1,143 542 (323 ) Asia Generation 618 375 345 243 30 Corporate and Other(1) 1,066 870 1,012 196 (142 ) Eliminations(2) (1,019 ) (862 ) (991 ) (157 ) 129 Total Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 $ 2,693 $ (1,243 ) Gross Margin: Latin America Generation $ 1,497 $ 1,357 $ 1,398 $ 140 $ (41 ) Latin America Utilities 1,072 918 886 154 32 North America Generation 435 477 660 (42 ) (183 ) North America Utilities 249 239 261 10 (22 ) Europe Generation 268 212 273 56 (61 ) Asia Generation 240 93 (10 ) 147 103 Corporate and Other(3) 186 117 62 69 55 Eliminations(4) 17 20 38 (3 ) (18 ) General and administrative expenses (392 ) (339 ) (368 ) (53 ) 29 Interest expense (1,526 ) (1,485 ) (1,770 ) (41 ) 285 Interest income 411 348 519 63 (171 ) Other expense (239 ) (111 ) (161 ) (128 ) 50 Other income 108 465 375 (357 ) 90 Gain on sale of investments 131 909 (131 ) (778 ) Loss on sale of subsidiary stock (31 ) 31 Goodwill impairment (21 ) (122 ) 101 (122 ) Asset impairment expense (1,221 ) (25 ) (175 ) (1,196 ) 150 Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position (33 ) 33 (184 ) (66 ) 217 Other non operating expense (7 ) (12 ) (15 ) 5 3 Income tax expense (307 ) (599 ) (771 ) 292 172 Net equity in earnings of affiliates 183 92 33 91 59 Income from continuing operations 920 1,809 1,929 (889 ) (120 ) Income from operations of discontinued businesses 75 96 97 (21 ) (1 ) Gain (loss) from disposal of discontinued businesses 64 (150 ) 6 214 (156 ) Net income 1,059 1,755 2,032 (696 ) (277 ) Noncontrolling interests: Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,006 ) (1,099 ) (759 ) 93 (340 ) (Income) loss from discontinuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (44 ) 2 (39 ) (46 ) 41 Net income attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 $ (649 ) $ (576 ) Per Share Data: Basic income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.75 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.69 ) Diluted income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.67 ) (1) Corporate and Other includes revenue from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, Wind Generation and other renewables initiatives.

These increases were partially offset by: lower volume sold at Uruguaiana of $53 million as a result of renegotiation of its power sales agreements; lower volume due to unfavorable hydrology in Colombia and Argentina of $41 million; lower contract prices at Gener of $32 million; and lower contract prices on PPAs indexed to international coal prices in the Dominican Republic of $22 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $106 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $34 million, or 3%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher spot prices in Argentina of $69 million; higher volume and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic of $55 million; higher contract prices of $33 million in Colombia; the positive impact of $28 million resulting from the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana, as mentioned above; and higher volume of $23 million in Panama. These increases were partially offset by: higher fuel and purchased energy prices at Gener of $48 million; the net effect of lower PPA prices and higher fuel costs in the Dominican Republic of $38 million; 130 Table of Contents the impact of a reversal of bad debt expense during the first quarter of 2009 of $36 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of one of its power sales agreements; and higher fixed costs of $30 million at Gener primarily due to higher employee costs, increased maintenance expenses and costs incurred due to construction delays at Campiche. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 17% while gross margin increased 10%, primarily due to higher spot purchases and fuel prices at Gener and the reversal of bad debt expense as a result of the renegotiation of one of the power sales agreements at Uruguaiana in the first quarter of 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $181 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $636 million, or 14%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower spot and contract prices of $295 million at Gener; lower volume of $227 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold; and lower energy prices and volume of $174 million in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: and increase of $100 million due to fewer outages at Gener and in Argentina in 2009; and higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $94 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $53 million, or 4%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;; fewer outages of $60 million at Gener and in Argentina; lower diesel consumption, partially offset by higher energy purchases and higher gas consumption, at Gener of $47 million; lower volume of energy purchased at Uruguaiana of $44 million as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements; and the favorable impact of $28 million of a decrease in bad debt expense at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of lower energy prices of $75 million in the Dominican Republic; lower volume and energy prices of $66 million in Argentina; higher purchased energy prices of $48 million at Uruguaiana; and lower spot sales of $48 million at Panama. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 18% while gross margin decreased 3%, primarily due to reduced energy purchases, fewer outages and lower bad debt expense. 131 Table of Contents Latin America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in Latin America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Latin America Utilities Revenue $ 7,222 $ 6,092 $ 5,907 19 % 3 % Gross Margin $ 1,072 $ 918 $ 886 17 % 4 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $697 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2010 increased $433 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $316 million, primarily in Brazil, due to increased market demand; and higher tariffs of $114 million primarily related to the July 2009 tariff reset in Brazil partially offset by the unfavorable impact on rates at Eletropaulo in Brazil of a cumulative adjustment to regulatory liabilities and higher energy prices across our Latin America utility businesses associated with energy purchases passed through to customers of $97 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $107 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $47 million, or 5%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $163 million, primarily in Brazil, due to the increased market demand; and lower contingencies of $142 million in Eletropaulo primarily related to labor contingencies which included a one time reversal, reflecting an agreement with Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o CESP, the pension plan administrator, of $51 million associated with claims for past benefit obligations which will now be accounted for as a component of the pension plan. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $238 million primarily due to the recovery in 2009 of a municipality receivable previously written off in Brazil and higher salaries and other employee related costs, provisions for commercial losses, regulatory penalties and maintenance costs; and $28 million related to the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $442 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2009 increased $627 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $560 million reflecting the recovery of energy purchases of $453 million that were passed through to customers at our utilities in Brazil and El Salvador; and higher volume in Brazil of $62 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $62 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2009 increased $94 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $107 million in El Salvador and Brazil; a $64 million recovery of a municipality receivable previously written off; 132 Table of Contents a non recurring PIS/COFINS fine in 2008 of $33 million; and higher volume of $32 million across the region. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of higher fixed costs of $120 million mainly related to pension expense, labor contingencies and maintenance costs in Brazil. North America Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Generation Revenue $ 1,972 $ 1,940 $ 2,234 2 % 13 % Gross Margin $ 435 $ 477 $ 660 9 % 28 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $19 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $13 million, or 1%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased rates, volume and an availability bonus at TEG/TEP in Mexico of $41 million; higher volume, primarily due to fewer outages and higher rates, of $22 million at Merida in Mexico; higher volume of $19 million at Warrior Run in Maryland due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. These increases were partially offset by: a net decrease of $50 million in New York due to lower rates partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a net decrease of $18 million at Deepwater in Texas primarily due to lower volume; and a net decrease of $14 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3 million, generation gross margin for 2010 decreased $45 million, or 9%, from 2009 primarily due to: a net decrease of $94 million in New York due to lower rates and higher coal prices partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a decrease of $16 million at Deepwater due to lower volume and rates; a net decrease of $11 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage; a decrease of $9 million in Hawaii due to an unfavorable impact of mark to market derivatives; and a decrease of $7 million in Puerto Rico due to higher fixed costs. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase of $39 million in New York primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of lower contract and maintenance costs, and other employee related costs; 133 Table of Contents a net increase of $26 million at TEG/TEP due to a current year availability bonus and fewer outages partially offset by higher fuel prices; higher volume of $14 million at Warrior Run due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 2% while gross margin decreased 9%, primarily due to the change in rates in New York having a greater impact on gross margin than revenue. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $44 million, primarily in Mexico, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $250 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $107 million in New York due to a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a decrease of $80 million due to a reduction in natural gas prices at Merida; increased outages of $22 million, $21 million and $17 million at Warrior Run, TEG/TEP and New York, respectively; lower rates of $20 million at Deepwater; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives in New York of $11 million; and the unfavorable impact in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $9 million, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $174 million, or 26%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $72 million in New York driven by a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a $29 million unfavorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments on coal supply contracts in Hawaii as a result of a gain of $22 million in 2008 compared to a loss of $7 million in 2009; an increase in outages of $22 million and $6 million at Warrior Run and in New York, respectively; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives of $11 million and higher emission allowance purchases of $13 million in New York; and the unfavorable impact of $9 million in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 13% while gross margin decreased 28%, primarily due to the increase in coal prices in New York and the unfavorable impact of derivatives in 2009 in Hawaii that had no corresponding impact on revenue. 134 Table of Contents North America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Utilities Revenue $ 1,145 $ 1,068 $ 1,079 7 % 1 % Gross Margin $ 249 $ 239 $ 261 4 % 8 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Utilities revenue for 2010 increased $77 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail demand of $64 million as a result of warmer weather and higher fuel adjustment charges; and increased wholesale revenue of $11 million primarily due to higher prices. Utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $10 million, or 4%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail margin of $20 million due to increased demand; lower pension expense of $12 million; and lower emission allowance expense of $5 million. These increases were partially offset by: increased maintenance expenses of $16 million due to the timing of major generating unit overhauls; and increased fixed costs of $14 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 7% while gross margin increased 4%, primarily due to increased fuel and maintenance costs. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Utilities revenue for 2009 decreased $11 million, or 1%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower retail volume of $31 million due primarily to milder weather and the economic recession; and decreased wholesale revenue of $7 million driven by lower market prices. These decreases were partially offset by: $32 million of voluntary credits IPL provided to retail customers in 2008. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters North America of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these credits. Utilities gross margin for 2009 decreased $22 million, or 8%, from 2008 primarily due to: decreased wholesale margin of $16 million due to unfavorable prices; and increased pension expense of $25 million largely due to the decline in market value of IPLs pension assets during 2008. 135 Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by: increased retail margin of $15 million, primarily due to the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, partially offset by lower retail sales volumes in 2009; and decreased property tax expense of $5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 1% while gross margin decreased 8%, primarily due to the $25 million increase in pension expense and the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, both of which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. Europe Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Europe for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Europe Generation Revenue $ 1,362 $ 820 $ 1,143 66 % 28 % Gross Margin $ 268 $ 212 $ 273 26 % 22 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $41 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $583 million, or 71%, from 2009 primarily due to: $409 million from the adoption of new accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) which resulted in the consolidation of Cartagena in Spain, a generation business previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting; $117 million from the operations of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom, which was acquired in August 2010; $16 million from a full year of combined cycle operations at our Amman East plant in Jordan, which was single cycle until August 2009; higher tariffs of $16 million at Altai in Kazakhstan; higher volume of $15 million at Kilroot in the United Kingdom largely driven by coal pass through and increased demand, partially offset by lower capacity revenue due to the termination of the long term PPA and related supplementary agreements. These increases were partially offset by: lower volume and sales of emissions allowances in Hungary of $16 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $1 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $57 million, or 27%, from 2009 primarily due to: $62 million from the consolidation of Cartagena as discussed above; higher tariffs and lower fixed costs at Altai of $29 million; and $13 million from the operations of Ballylumford since its acquisition. 136 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: lower gross margin of $28 million primarily from the termination of the long term PPA at Kilroot; and lower gross margin of $20 million in Hungary primarily attributable to higher fuel costs that could not be passed through and lower sales of emission allowances. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 66% while gross margin increased 26%, primarily due to the consolidation of Cartagena and acquisition of Ballylumford that have a larger positive impact on revenue than gross margin, and the positive impact of higher energy revenue at Kilroot, which as a pass through had no corresponding impact on gross margin. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $146 million, driven mainly by Kilroot, Hungary and Kazakhstan, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $177 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower revenue of $101 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower volume of $81 million in Hungary due to the combined impact of the cancellation of one of our PPAs and reduced demand; and lower volume of $67 million at Kilroot, a coal fired plant, mainly driven by lower dispatch due to favorable gas prices compared to coal. These decreases were partially offset by: the benefit of new business of $50 million at Amman East, which commenced single cycle operations in July 2008; and higher rates of $15 million in Kazakhstan. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $35 million, driven mainly by Kilroot and Kazakhstan, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $26 million, or 10%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower gross margin of $41 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower demand of $12 million in Hungary; and an overall increase of $22 million in fixed costs across the region. These decreases were partially offset by: higher capacity revenue at Kilroot; higher energy prices in Kazakhstan; and the benefit of new business at Amman East. Asia Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Asia for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Asia Generation Revenue $ 618 $ 375 $ 345 65 % 9 % Gross Margin $ 240 $ 93 $ (10 ) 158 % 1030 % 137 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $28 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $215 million, or 57%, from 2009 primarily due to: favorable generation rates and volume of $210 million at Masinloc in the Philippines as a result of increased market demand and improved plant availability subsequent to the completion of its overhaul at the beginning of 2010; and higher demand from both new and existing contract and spot customers as a result of lower supply shortages in the Philippines power market due to a strong energy growth rate. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $13 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $134 million, or 144%, from 2009 primarily due to a combination of higher availability attributable to improved plant operations, higher market demand and favorable spot prices at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 65% while gross margin increased 158%, primarily due to the positive influence on gross margin due to favorable spot rates and operational efficiencies resulting from the Masinloc plant overhauls in late 2009 and early 2010, which led to higher availability and allowed for more efficient operations that have materially improved the operating results for 2010 as compared to 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $23 million, primarily in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, generation revenue for 2009 increased $53 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: the benefit of $46 million of our new business Masinloc, which was acquired in April 2008; increased revenue of $70 million in 2009 at Masinloc due to improved rates and volume as a result of improved availability and new customer contracts; and $18 million from a one time favorable energy sales settlement at Masinloc. These increases were partially offset by: the decrease in revenue of $71 million at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka primarily due to a decline in fuel costs which are largely passed through to the customer and higher outages in 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by higher capacity revenue. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $6 million, primarily in the Philippines, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $109 million, or 1,090%, from 2008 primarily due to: the impact of our new business at Masinloc of $23 million; a $91 million increase at Masinloc due to higher contract sales, where margins are more favorable than spot sales, lower fuel prices, improved availability and the favorable energy sales settlement described above; and higher capacity revenue at Kelanitissa of $10 million. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $20 million at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue increased 9% while gross margin increased 1,030%, primarily due to higher contract margins at Masinloc as a result of improved operations, availability and lower fuel prices, as well as the larger relative impact on gross margin from the one time favorable energy sales settlement described above. 138 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Corporate and other includes the net operating results from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, AES Wind Generation and renewables projects which are immaterial for the purposes of separate segment disclosure. The following table excludes inter segment activity and summarizes revenue and gross margin for Corporate and Other entities for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Revenue Europe Utilities $ 356 $ 286 $ 403 24 % 29 % Africa Utilities 422 370 379 14 % 2 % Africa Generation 61 65 65 6 % 0 % Wind Generation 202 133 128 52 % 4 % Corp/Other 25 16 37 56 % 57 % Total Corporate and Other $ 1,066 $ 870 $ 1,012 23 % 14 % Gross Margin Europe Utilities $ 21 $ 16 $ 34 31 % 53 % Africa Utilities 65 71 30 8 % 137 % Africa Generation 54 41 28 32 % 46 % Wind Generation 44 11 19 300 % 42 % Corp/Other 2 (22 ) (49 ) 109 % 55 % Total Corporate and Other $ 186 $ 117 $ 62 59 % 89 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $30 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other revenue increased $226 million for 2010, or 26% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: higher volume at our utility businesses in Ukraine driven by an overall increase in market demand; higher volume and utility tariffs at Sonel in Cameroon driven by an increase in market demand; and incremental revenue from new wind generation projects that commenced operations during the year and an overall volume increase across our wind businesses. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $8 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $77 million for 2010, or 66% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: an increase in gross margin from our new wind generation projects and higher volume, as discussed above; and an increase in volume at Dibamba, our generation business, in Cameroon. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs at Sonel. 139 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $162 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other revenue increased $20 million for 2009, or 2%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: higher tariffs in Ukraine of $27 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $12 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $67 million for 2009, or 108%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: a decrease in fixed costs across the Africa region. The increase was partially offset by: higher fuel consumption attributable to lower hydrology at Sonel. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense includes those expenses related to corporate and region staff functions and or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems, and development costs. General and administrative expenses increased $53 million, or 16%, to $392 million in 2010 from 2009. The increase is primarily related to business development costs associated with increased development efforts, primarily in Europe, Turkey and India. General and administrative expenses decreased $29 million, or 8%, to $339 million in 2009 from 2008. The decrease is primarily related to 2008 professional fees associated with remediation efforts and a reduction in business development costs. The favorable variance is partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the worldwide implementation of SAP. Interest expense Interest expense increased $41 million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to interest expense at Cartagena which is now a consolidated entity, higher interest rates at Tiet&ecirc;, increased debt principal at Eletropaulo and interest being expensed related to St. Nikola, our wind project in Bulgaria, due to commencement of operations in 2010. These increases were partially offset by reduced debt principal at the Parent Company. Interest expense decreased $285 million, or 16%, to $1.5 billion in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates globally due to economic conditions and inflationary adjustments to the market price index in Brazil. In addition, interest expense decreased as a result of favorable foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil and lower interest expenses associated with decreased debt balances at Eletropaulo. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense at Masinloc in the Philippines which was acquired in April 2008, and interest expense at Infovias in Brazil where a fee on a non exercised credit line was written off. Interest income Interest income increased $63 million, or 18%, to $411 million in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to a higher average balance in short term investments at Eletropaulo and the favorable impact of 140 Table of Contents foreign currency translation in Brazil as well as the settlement of a dispute related to inflation adjustments for energy sales at Tiet&ecirc;. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest income from a loan to a wind development project in Brazil which was repaid in June 2010. Interest income decreased $171 million, or 33%, to $348 million in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances in Brazil, unfavorable foreign currency translation in Brazil, the impact of decreased interest rates and inflationary adjustments on accounts receivable in 2008 at Gener in Chile and a decreased cash balance at the Parent Company.

The net impact to the Company after taxes and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Other income also included a gain on sale of assets at Eletropaulo. Other income of $465 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $165 million from the reduction in interest and penalties associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the REFIS program and a $129 million gain related to a favorable court decision enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. The net impact to the Company after income taxes and noncontrolling interests for these items was $44 million. In addition, the Company recognized income in 2009 of $80 million from a performance incentive bonus for management services provided to Ekibastuz and Maikuben in 2008. The management agreement was related to the sale of these businesses in Kazakhstan in May 2008; see further discussion of this transaction in Note 22 Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Other income of $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included gains on the extinguishment of a gross receipts tax liability and a legal contingency at Eletropaulo of $117 million and $75 million, respectively, $32 million of cash proceeds related to a favorable legal settlement at Southland in California, $29 million of insurance recoveries for damaged turbines at Uruguaiana, $23 million of gains associated with a sale of land at Eletropaulo and sales of turbines at Itabo, and compensation of $18 million for the impairment associated with the settlement agreement to shut down Hefei. 141 Table of Contents Other expense Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Loss on sale and disposal of assets $ 84 $ 42 $ 34 Gener gas settlement 72 Loss on extinguishment of debt 37 70 AES Wind transaction costs 22 Other 24 69 57 Total other expense $ 239 $ 111 $ 161 Other expense of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $72 million for a settlement agreement of gas transportation contracts at Gener. There were also previously capitalized transaction costs of $22 million that were incurred in connection with the preparation for the sale of a noncontrolling interest in our Wind Generation business which were written off upon the expiration of the letter of intent in June 2010. In addition, there were losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo, Panama, and Gener, an $18 million loss on debt extinguishment at Andres and Itabo and a $15 million loss at the Parent Company from the retirement of senior notes. Other expense of $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $13 million loss recognized when three of our businesses in the Dominican Republic received $110 million par value bonds issued by the Dominican Republic government to settle existing accounts receivable for the same amount from the government owned distribution companies. The loss represented an adjustment to reflect the fair value of the bonds on the date received. Other expense also included losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo and Andres and contingencies at our businesses in Kazakhstan and Alicura in Argentina. Other expense of $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $69 million of losses on the retirement of debt at the Parent Company in connection with the refinancing in June 2008 and IPALCO associated with a $375 million refinancing in April 2008 and losses on disposal of assets primarily at Eletropaulo. Goodwill Impairment In 2010, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2010, Deepwater, our pet coke fired merchant generation facility in Texas, determined that there was an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. This determination was primarily based on managements decision not to operate the plant for more than 30 days in the third quarter of 2010, current operating and cash flow losses, and forecasted operating and cash flow losses for the remainder of 2010 through 2014 as a result of declining trends in energy pricing curves and increasing pet coke prices. As a result, Deepwater recognized a goodwill impairment of $18 million. Deepwater is reported in the North America Generation segment. In 2009, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $122 million. This was a result of impairment at certain of our businesses in the United Kingdom and Ukraine as a result of the Companys annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of October 1. The most significant goodwill impairment was at Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom. Factors contributing to the recognition of impairment included: reduced profit expectations based on latest estimates of future commodity prices and reduced expectations on the recovery of cash flows on the existing plant following the Companys decision to forgo capital expenditures to meet emission allowance requirements taking effect in 2024. The fair value of the Companys reporting units are inherently sensitive to the assumptions underlying the estimates of fair value. Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Fair Value, Goodwill and Intangibles in Item 8 of this Form 10 K provides a 142 Table of Contents more detailed discussion of those assumptions. As discussed in Key Trends and Uncertainties, in the future, the fair values of the Companys reporting units might decline as a result of adverse changes in their operating environments or the businesses reaching the end of their finite lives, which could require the Company to record additional goodwill impairment charges. The Company did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2008. Asset Impairment Expense As discussed in Note 19 Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, asset impairment expense for the year 2010 was $1,221 million and consisted primarily of the following: Eastern Energy AEE operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated a recoverability test of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Southland In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and the exact form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process 143 Table of Contents through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations and the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. The Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment. The asset group was determined to be at the individual plant level and based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined that the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the Huntington Beach asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying value of the Huntington Beach plant of $288 million exceeded the fair value of $88 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $200 million. The undiscounted cash flows of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach generation facilities exceeded their respective carrying values and resulted in no impairment. Huntington Beach is reported in the North America Generation reportable segment. Tisza II During the third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into annual negotiations with the offtaker of its Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. As a result of these preliminary negotiations, as well as the further deterioration of the economic environment in Hungary, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. Thus, the Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and determined that based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount of the Tisza II asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The carrying value of the Tisza II asset group of $160 million exceeded the fair value of $75 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $85 million. Tisza II is reported in the Europe Generation reportable segment. Deepwater In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW pet coke fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, 144 Table of Contents all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Asset impairment expense for the year 2009 was $25 million. In 2009, the Company recognized a pre tax long lived asset impairment charge of $11 million related to the Companys Piabanha hydro project in Brazil. The Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows and abandoned the project. Asset impairment expense for the year 2008 was $175 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, the Company reviewed and prioritized projects in the development pipeline. From this review, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows for certain projects. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $75 million ($34 million, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes) related to two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non power development project at one of our facilities in North America. During 2008, the Company recognized additional impairment charges of $36 million related to long lived assets at Uruguaiana. The impairment was triggered by a combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy in 2007 that continued in 2008. Following an initial impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, further charges were incurred in 2008 due to fixed asset purchase agreements in place. During the first half of 2008, the Company withdrew from projects in South Africa and Israel which resulted in impairment charges of $36 million. The Company also recognized an impairment of $18 million related to the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China. Gain on sale of investments There was no gain on sale of investments in 2010. Gain on sale of investments of $131 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $98 million recognized in May 2009 related to the termination of the management agreement between the Company and Kazakhmys PLC for Ekibastuz and Maikuben, a gain of $14 million from the sale of the remaining assets associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China and $13 million from the reversal of a contingent liability related to the Kazakhstan sale in 2008. Gain on sale of investments of $909 million in 2008 consisted primarily of the sale in May 2008 of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Ekibastuz and Maikuben for a net gain of $905 million. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock There was no loss on sale of subsidiary stock in 2010 or 2009. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock of $31 million in 2008 was the result of sales of AES Gener shares made by our wholly owned subsidiary Cachagua. In November 2008, Cachagua sold 9.6% of its ownership in Gener to a third party reducing its ownership in Gener to 70.6%. 145 Table of Contents Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Companys net monetary position from foreign currency transaction activities: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) AES Corporation $ (50 ) $ 13 $ 38 Chile 8 65 (96 ) Philippines 8 15 (57 ) Brazil (6 ) (9 ) (44 ) Argentina 12 (10 ) (28 ) Kazakhstan 1 (24 ) 14 Colombia (4 ) (11 ) 5 Other (2 ) (6 ) (16 ) Total(1) $ (33 ) $ 33 $ (184 ) (1) Includes (losses) gains of $(10) million, $(39) million and $10 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These losses consisted primarily of losses at The AES Corporation partially offset by gains in Argentina. Losses of $50 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the devaluation of notes receivable resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound, and losses on foreign exchange swaps and options, partially offset by gains on cash balances and debt denominated in British Pounds. Gains of $12 million in Argentina were primarily due to a gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso by 5%, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These gains consisted primarily of gains in Chile, the Philippines and at The AES Corporation partially offset by losses in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. Gains of $65 million in Chile were primarily due to the appreciation of the Chilean Peso of 20% resulting in gains at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Peso, mainly cash and accounts receivables. This gain was partially offset by $14 million in losses on foreign currency derivatives. Gains of $15 million in the Philippines were primarily due to the appreciation of the Philippine Peso of 3%, resulting in gains at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on the remeasurement of U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $13 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the settlement of the senior unsecured credit facility and the revaluation of notes receivable denominated in the Euro, partially offset by losses on debt denominated in British Pounds. Losses of $24 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar and $12 million of foreign currency transaction losses on debt and other liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Kazakh Tenge. 146 Table of Contents Losses of $11 million in Colombia were primarily due to the appreciation of the Colombian Peso of 9%, resulting in losses at Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its Colombian Peso denominated debt and losses on foreign currency derivatives. Losses of $10 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2009, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt, partially offset by derivative gains. Losses of $9 million in Brazil were primarily due to energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar, resulting in foreign currency transaction losses of $18 million, partially offset by gains of $9 million due to the appreciation in 2009 of the Brazilian Real of 25%, resulting in gains at Sul and Uruguaiana associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These losses consisted primarily of losses in Chile, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina partially offset by gains at The AES Corporation and in Kazakhstan. Losses of $96 million in Chile were primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso of 28% in 2008, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable and value added tax (VAT) receivables. Losses of $57 million in the Philippines were primarily due to remeasurement losses at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on U.S. Dollar denominated debt resulting from depreciation of the Philippine Peso of 14% in 2008. Losses of $44 million in Brazil were primarily due to the realization of deferred exchange variance on past energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar. Losses of $28 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2008, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $38 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to debt denominated in British Pounds and gains on foreign exchange derivatives, partially offset by losses on notes receivable denominated in the Euro. Gains of $14 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction gains of $16 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar, offset by $5 million of foreign currency transaction losses on external and intercompany debt denominated in other than the Kazakh Tenge functional currency. Income taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $292 million, or 49%, to $307 million in 2010. The Companys effective tax rates were 29% for 2010 and 26% for 2009. The net increase in the 2010 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 relating to the CEMIG sale transaction, tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowances at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, and $165 million of non taxable income recorded in 2009 at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program. These items were offset by income tax benefits related to a reversal of withholding tax liabilities at certain Chilean subsidiaries and 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries. Included in the net tax expense related to the CEMIG sale transaction is tax expense on the equity earnings associated with the reversal of the net long term liability and tax benefit related to release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. 147 Table of Contents Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $172 million, or 22%, to $599 million in 2009. The Companys effective tax rates were 26% for 2009 and 29% for 2008. The net decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowance at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recorded at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $91 million, or 99%, to $183 million in 2010 from $92 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a gain recognized upon the sale of our interest in CEMIG during the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by 2009 equity in earnings of Cartagena which was accounted for as a consolidated entity in 2010 and thus reported directly within revenues and expenses. Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $59 million, or 179%, to $92 million in 2009 from $33 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a cash settlement received by Cartagena, in Spain, in June 2009 for liquidated damages received related to a construction delay from December 2005 to November 2006; increased earnings at Guacolda in Chile mainly due to lower cost of coal; increased earnings of Chigen affiliates from higher tariffs partially offset by lower volume and a valuation write off in 2008 at an affiliate in Turkey. These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings at OPGC, in India, mainly due to lower tariff and a dividend distribution tax in March 2009 and increased expenses for an equipment overhaul at Elsta in the Netherlands. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $93 million, or 8%, to $1.0 billion in 2010 from $1.1 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreased earnings at Eletropaulo as a result of the absence of legal settlement income present in 2009, a loss on legal settlement at Gener and reduced revenues due to decreased coal prices along with higher electricity purchases at Itabo. These decreases were partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian Real. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $340 million, or 45%, to $1.1 billion in 2009 from $0.8 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to increases in gross margin and other income, lower interest expense and a decrease in impairments in 2009 at our Brazilian businesses, and increases in gross margin and foreign currency transaction gains at our businesses in Chile. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $44 million at certain of our wind generation businesses as a result of a charge related to the potential future taxes that could be deemed due in the calculation of the hypothetical liquidation value of certain of our wind tax equity partnerships. Discontinued operations As further discussed in Note 21 Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Businesses to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, Discontinued Operations includes the results of five businesses: Ras Laffan, a generation business in Qatar (sold in October 2010); Barka, a generation business in Oman, (sold in August 2010); Lal Pir and Pak Gen, generation businesses in Pakistan, (sold in June 2010); and Jiaozuo, a generation business in China, (sold in December 2008). Prior periods have been restated to reflect these businesses within Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. In 2010, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $39 million and reflected the operations of our 55% stake in Ras Laffan, a combined cycle gas facility and water desalination plant in Qatar, our 35% stake in Barka, a combined cycle gas 148 Table of Contents facility and water desalination plant in Oman and our 55% stake in Lal Pir and Pak Gen, two oil fired facilities in Pakistan. The sale of Lal Pir and Pak Gen closed in June 2010, resulting in additional impairment expense and a loss on the sale in 2010 of $14 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The Barka plant was sold in August 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $63 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The sale of Ras Laffan closed in October 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $6 million, net of tax. In 2009, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $54 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir and Pak Gen. Loss on disposal of discontinued businesses, net of tax and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $105 million and represented the difference between the net book value of the Companys interests in its Pakistan businesses and their estimated fair value. In 2008, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $60 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir, Pak Gen and Jiaozuo, a coal fired generation facility in China sold in December 2008. The Company received $73 million for its 70% interest in the business. The net gain on the disposition was $7 million. Critical Accounting Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Companys most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Reserves We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the tax jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material. 149 Table of Contents On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act). The Act includes several provisions which provide for tax relief for businesses by extending certain tax benefits and credits, including the Subpart F exception for active financing income and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look through provisions of Subpart F. This legislation resulted in a benefit for the Companys 2010 provision for income taxes; however, there can be no assurances that the benefits of this legislation will extend beyond 2011, when it is currently scheduled to expire. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Goodwill and Other Intangibles and Long lived Assets, respectively, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level on October 1. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying amount. A long lived asset (asset group) will be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e., the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are less than its carrying amount. In the event that the carrying amount of the long lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment evaluation is performed, in which the fair value of the asset is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. Examples of indicators that would result in an impairment test for goodwill and a recoverability test for long lived assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate, legislation changes or a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition. Throughout the impairment evaluation process, management makes considerable judgments; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part of an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost/benefit analysis and the Companys internal valuation knowledge of the long lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the DCF model), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factors expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. 150 Table of Contents A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Managements Discussion and Analysis, Consolidated Results of Operations Goodwill Impairment and Asset Impairment Expense and Note 19 Impairment Expense and Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Fair Value Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent), derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long term liabilities. The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Companys investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Companys derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where 151 Table of Contents derivatives qualify and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Companys interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Companys derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterpartys) and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Platts). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instruments fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on indicative pricing quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities The Company adopted the fair value measurement accounting guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009. The most significant of these estimates surround the fair value measurement of long lived tangible and intangible assets when tested for impairment upon a triggering event or during the annual impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill. These estimates include making assumptions regarding useful life, the impact of economic obsolescence and expected future cash flows. Additional factors are discussed above in the Impairments section. 152 Table of Contents Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard creates a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business We are a global power company. We operate two primary lines of business. The first is our Generation business, where we own and or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities, other intermediaries and certain end users. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our Generation and Utilities businesses comprised approximately 45% and 55% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We are also continuing to expand our wind and solar generation businesses. These initiatives are not material contributors to our operating results at this time, but we believe that certain of these initiatives may become material in the future. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10 K. Our Organization and Segments. Our management reporting structure is organized along our two lines of business (Generation and Utilities) and three regions: (1) Latin America & Africa; (2) North America; and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia (collectively EMEA), each managed by a regional president. The financial reporting segment structure uses our management reporting structure as its foundation and reflects how we manage the business internally. Based on our application of the segment reporting accounting guidance, which provides certain quantitative thresholds and aggregation criteria, we have concluded that the Company has the following six reportable segments: Latin America Generation; Latin America Utilities; North America Generation; North America Utilities; Europe Generation; Asia Generation. We report the Companys Europe Utilities, Africa Utilities, Africa Generation, Wind Generation and Climate Solutions operating segments within Corporate and Other because they do not meet the criteria to allow for aggregation with another operating segment or the quantitative thresholds that would require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. None of these operating segments are currently material to our financial statement presentation of reportable segments, individually or in the aggregate. Corporate and Other also includes corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments and other intercompany charges such as self insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company modified its internal reporting structure to move the management of the Companys generation business in Jordan, Amman East, from Asia to Europe. Accordingly, Amman East is now reported within the Europe Generation segment. All prior periods have been retrospectively restated to reflect this change and conform to current period presentation. Key Drivers of Our Results of Operations. Our Generation and Utilities businesses are distinguished by the nature of their customers, operational differences, cost structure, regulatory environment and risk exposure. As a result, each line of business has slightly different drivers which affect operating results. Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other things, plant reliability and efficiency, power prices, volume, 113 Table of Contents management of fixed and variable operating costs, management of working capital including collection of receivables, and the extent to which our plants have hedged their exposure to currency and commodities such as fuel. For our Generation businesses which sell power under short term contracts or in the spot market, the most crucial factors are the current market price of electricity and the marginal costs of production. Growth in our Generation business is largely tied to securing new PPAs, expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building or acquiring new power plants. Performance drivers for our Utilities businesses include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; management of working capital, including collection of receivables; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive regulatory requirements; and in developing countries, reduction of commercial and technical losses. The operating results of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth and weather conditions in areas in which they operate. In addition to these drivers, as further explained below, the Company also has exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. One of the key factors which affect our Generation business is our ability to enter into contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of fuel used to produce that electricity. Long term contracts are intended to reduce exposure to volatility associated with fuel prices in the market and the price of electricity by fixing the revenue and costs for these businesses. The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. In turn, most of these businesses enter into long term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling arrangements where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. While these long term contractual agreements reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel, the predictability of operating results and cash flows vary by business based on the extent to which a facilitys generation capacity and fuel requirements are contracted and the negotiated terms of these agreements. Entering into these contracts exposes us to counterparty credit risk. For further discussion of these risks, see Supplier and or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. When fuel costs increase, many of our businesses are able to pass these costs on to their customers. Generation businesses with long term contracts in place do this by including fuel pass through or fuel indexing arrangements in their contracts. Utilities businesses can pass costs on to their customers through increases in current or future tariff rates. Therefore, in a rising fuel cost environment, the increased fuel costs for these businesses often result in an increase in revenue to the extent these costs can be passed through (though not necessarily on a one for one basis). Conversely, in a declining fuel cost environment, the decreased fuel costs can result in a decrease in revenue. Increases or decreases in revenue at these businesses that have the ability to pass through costs to the customer have a corresponding impact on cost of sales, to the extent the costs can be passed through, resulting in a limited impact on gross margin, if any. Although these circumstances may not have a large impact on gross margin, they can significantly affect gross margin as a percentage of revenue. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of revenue is a less relevant measure when evaluating our operating performance. To the extent our businesses are unable to pass through fuel cost increases to their customers, gross margin may be adversely affected. Global diversification also helps us mitigate risk. Our presence in mature markets helps mitigate the exposure associated with our businesses in emerging markets. Additionally, our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil, water (hydroelectric power), wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. However, to the extent the mix of fuel sources enabling our generation capabilities in any one market is not diversified, the spread in costs of different fuels or the availability of natural resources such as water for hydroelectric power production or wind may also influence the operating performance and the ability of our subsidiaries to compete within that market. For example, in a market where gas prices fall to a low level compared to coal prices, power prices may be set by low gas prices which can affect the profitability of our coal plants in that market. In certain cases, we may attempt to hedge fuel prices to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our interest rate and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the underlying business. However, we only hedge a 114 Table of Contents portion of our currency and commodity risks, and our businesses are still subject to these risks, as further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. Commodity and power price volatility could continue to impact our financial metrics to the extent this volatility is not hedged. For a discussion of our sensitivities to commodity, currency and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Form 10 K. Due to our global presence, the Company has significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure is primarily associated with the impact of the translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results from their local currency to U.S. Dollars that is required for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, there is foreign currency transaction exposure when an entity enters into transactions, including debt agreements, in currencies other than their functional currency. These risks are further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations. During 2010, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a significant impact on our operating results. If the current foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues, our gross margin and other financial metrics could continue to be affected. Another key driver of our results is our ability to bring new businesses into commercial operation successfully. We currently have approximately 1,300 MW of projects under construction in eight countries. Our prospects for improved operating results and cash flows are dependent upon successful completion of these projects on time and within budget. However, as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties, construction is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with site identification, financing, permitting and our ability to meet construction deadlines. Delays or the inability to complete projects and commence commercial operations can result in increased costs, impairment of assets and other challenges involving partners and counterparties to our construction agreements, PPAs and other agreements. Our gross margin is also impacted by the fact that in each country in which we conduct business, we are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity, and environmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business. Regulations differ on a country by country basis (and even at the state and local municipality levels) and are based upon the type of business we operate in a particular country, and affect many aspects of our operations and development projects. Our ability to negotiate tariffs, enter into long term contracts, pass through costs related to capital expenditures and otherwise navigate these regulations can have an impact on our revenue, costs and gross margin. Environmental and land use regulations, including existing and proposed regulation of GHG emissions, could substantially increase our capital expenditures or other compliance costs, which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. For a further discussion of the Regulatory Environment, see Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments Environmental, included in Item 8. Financial Statements, Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Associated with Government Regulation and Laws of this Form 10 K. Key Drivers of Results in 2010 In 2010, the Companys gross margin and cash flow from operations increased $531 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, while net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million compared to the prior year. During 2010, our North American generation businesses continued to face challenges associated with relatively lower gas prices and a decline in power prices relative to coal and other fuel. In particular, lower gas and power prices have affected the generation volume and financial results of our coal fired plants in New York and our petroleum coke fired plant in Texas which are merchant businesses and not subject to PPAs. We expect 115 Table of Contents this trend to continue. In 2010, these challenges were partially mitigated by hedging arrangements. In North America, current dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not present a long term opportunity to engage in hedging activity for 2011 and we have very limited hedges in place. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. As a result of these and other challenges that arose from new regulatory concerns, we impaired $1.1 billion of assets and goodwill in North America as described in Impairments below. In addition, AES Thames, our 208 MW coal fired generation business in Connecticut, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2011. Despite these challenges, many of our financial measures have improved when compared to 2009. Gross margin increased due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation caused by a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies in 2010 and better operating performance at certain businesses. For instance, certain of the Companys Latin American businesses experienced continued increases in market demand due to the local economic recovery in Latin America. The Company also benefited from higher demand and favorable market conditions at Masinloc, our generation business in the Philippines. Masinlocs higher availability enabled the Company to benefit from increased contract and spot market sales and favorable market prices in the Philippines. In addition, cash provided by operating activities increased due to the improved operating results at Latin America generation businesses and Masinloc; contributions from the consolidation of Cartagena and the Ballylumford acquisition in 2010; and changes in working capital in Latin America. Despite the increase in gross margin in 2010, net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased primarily from the impact of long lived asset impairments recognized related to four businesses: Eastern Energy in New York, Southland in California, Tisza II in Hungary and Deepwater in Texas. These were partially offset by gains from the sale of our discontinued businesses in Oman and Qatar and a decrease in goodwill impairment charges. In 2011, we expect to face continued challenges in our business, including the trends in North America described above. In addition, the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and commodity prices on our operations may continue into 2011. In 2011, the components of the tariff reset in Brazil and its potential impact on our Brazilian utilities are uncertain at this time and we expect continued challenges in our merchant businesses such as those in the U.S., Hungary and Northern Ireland. However, management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses and growth from new businesses acquired, that commenced operations in 2010 or are expected to commence operations in 2011, may lessen or offset the impact of these challenges described above, as they did in 2010. However, if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described above or elsewhere in this section impact us more than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our gross margin and net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In addition, we do not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. Such cash flows may be influenced by the operating challenges presented above and will also not include the cash flows from operations which were sold in 2010 or the increases experienced from the cash flows provided by the initial consolidation of Cartagena, the acquisition of Ballylumford and several working capital transactions at our Latin American utilities in 2010 as discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity. The following briefly describes the key changes in our reported revenue, gross margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, Adjusted Earnings per Share (a non GAAP measure) and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Results of Operations and Segment Analysis discussion within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. 116 Table of Contents Performance Highlights Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 Gross Margin $ 3,964 $ 3,433 $ 3,568 Net Income Attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share from Continuing Operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (a non GAAP measure)(1) $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 3,510 $ 2,202 $ 2,160 (1) See reconciliation and definition below under Non GAAP Measure. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue increased $2.7 billion, or 19%, to $16.6 billion in 2010 compared with $14.0 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $805 million; increased volume and rates at our Brazilian utilities attributable to increased demand due to the recovery of the local economy and the favorable impact of the June 2009 tariff reset; the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010; the favorable impact of rates at our generation businesses in Argentina; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; higher demand at Gener in Chile; the impact of the Companys new business in Northern Ireland, acquired in August 2010; and higher demand and rates at Indianapolis Power and Light. Gross margin increased $531 million, or 15%, to $4.0 billion in 2010 compared with $3.4 billion in 2009. Key drivers of the increase included: the favorable impact of foreign currency of $219 million; an increase in demand at our generation and utilities businesses in Latin America; higher generation rates and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines; and the impact of the consolidation of Cartagena, in Spain, in accordance with the new consolidation accounting guidance which became effective January 1, 2010. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs in Latin America, largely driven by bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil in 2009 that did not recur; and lower rates at our generation businesses in New York. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $649 million to $9 million in 2010, compared to $658 million in 2009. Key drivers of the decrease included: Impairment losses in New York related to our Eastern Energy facilities, in California related to our Southland (Huntington Beach) generation facility, in Hungary related to our Tisza II generation facility and in Texas related to our Deepwater facility; 117 Table of Contents A decrease in gain on sale of investments due to the sale of our businesses in Northern Kazakhstan which occurred in 2009; and A decrease in other income due to the reduction in interest and penalties in 2009 associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the Programa de Recuperacao Fiscal (REFIS) program and a favorable court decision in 2009 enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by: The gain on sale of discontinued operations related to the sale of Barka which occurred in August 2010; An increase in net equity in earnings of affiliates partially offset by income tax expense related to the sale of the Companys indirect investment in Companhia Energ&eacute;tica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Lower impairment expenses related to a goodwill impairment of our business in Kilroot that occurred in 2009; Lower income tax expense due to 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries; and An increase in gross margin as described above. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion, or 59%, to $3.5 billion in 2010 compared with $2.2 billion in 2009. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $837 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased tax payments in 2009 associated with a tax amnesty program of $326 million, higher working capital requirements during 2009 related to payments on the settlement of swap agreements of $65 million and in 2010, a $50 million decrease in employer contributions to pension plans and lower payments for contingencies; an increase of $215 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to the higher gross margin in 2010 combined with improved working capital mainly as a result of higher collections of value added taxes and accounts receivable; an increase of $99 million at Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher gross margin; and an increase of $58 million as a result of our consolidation of Cartagena in 2010 and the acquisition of Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $136 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations of businesses sold in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of businesses sold was $33 million and will not recur in 2011. In 2010 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities at our Latin American Utilities businesses included several items such as the tax amnesty program and settlement of swap agreements, as described above, that are not expected to recur. In addition, 2010 net cash provided by operating activities benefited from the one time cash savings related to the utilization of tax credits received as a result of the REFIS program. As such, the Company does not expect the trend of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities realized in 2010 to continue in 2011. 118 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue decreased $1.2 billion, or 8%, to $14.0 billion in 2009 compared with $15.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $997 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; decreases in volume at Uruguaiana due to the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold, as well as in New York and Hungary and lower dispatch in Northern Ireland due to unfavorable gas prices compared to coal; the impact of lower spot and contract energy prices at our generation business in Chile; and lower energy prices and volume at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase in tariff rates at our utilities businesses in Latin America primarily reflecting the recovery of energy purchases that were passed through to our customers. Gross margin decreased $135 million, or 4%, to $3.4 billion in 2009 compared with $3.6 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $218 million, largely driven by the Brazilian Real; lower energy prices and higher purchased energy costs at our generation businesses in the Dominican Republic and Argentina; increased pension costs in Brazil and the U.S.; and lower volume in New York due to lower spot market rates. These decreases were partially offset by: improved operating performance at our generation businesses in Chile and the Philippines; higher tariffs in Brazil and El Salvador; and bad debt recoveries and a reduction in bad debt expense in Brazil. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $576 million to $658 million in 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in 2008. Key drivers of the decrease included: a gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Northern Kazakhstan partially offset by a performance incentive bonus recognized in 2009 for management services provided to these subsidiaries and a settlement upon termination of the management agreement in 2009; the reduction in gross margin in 2009 as described above; and higher impairment expenses in 2009 as a result of an impairment of goodwill at Kilroot in Northern Ireland, and an impairment recognized on our assets in Pakistan which is reflected in discontinued operations, offset by a decline in long lived asset impairment compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by: a reduction in foreign currency transaction losses on net monetary position as a result of reduced losses at our businesses in Chile and the Philippines; a reduction in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates and debt balances in Brazil and favorable foreign currency translation; and lower income tax expenses driven in part by lower pre tax income and a decrease in the effective tax rate from 29% in 2008 to 26% in 2009 due, in part, to tax benefits recorded in 2009 upon the release of 119 Table of Contents valuation allowances at U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recognized in Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. In 2008, the $905 million gain recognized on the sale of our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses had a significant impact on net income attributable to The AES Corporation. In 2009, the Company recognized a performance incentive bonus of $80 million in the first quarter for management services provided to these sold businesses, reflected as other income. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized an additional gain on the sale of the businesses of $98.5 million upon the termination of the management agreement. While the Company engages in the sale of assets and businesses from time to time, the gain or loss recognized in any such sale will depend on a number of factors related to the asset or business that may be sold. Therefore, the Company does not believe that the decline in net income between 2008 and 2009 represents a trend. All of the amounts related to our two Northern Kazakhstan businesses were reported in continuing operations and will not recur in 2010 or future years. Net cash from operating activities increased $42 million, or 2%, to $2.2 billion in 2009 compared with $2.2 billion in 2008. This net increase was primarily due to the following: an increase of $238 million at our Latin American Generation businesses due to improved working capital management; an increase of $148 million at our Asia Generation businesses due to improved working capital management and improved gross margin; and an increase of $115 million at our Europe Generation businesses primarily due to the collection of the $80 million Kazakhstan management performance incentive bonus in the first quarter 2009. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $391 million at our Latin American Utilities businesses due to increased working capital requirements, including the payment of the settlement of a swap agreement, increased tax payments associated with a tax amnesty program and increased payments related to the settlement of contingencies and energy purchases, partially offset by increased operating results; and a decrease of $77 million at our North America Generation businesses, primarily due to reduced operating results. Non GAAP Measure We define adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) mark to market amounts related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) significant gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) significant losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. AES believes that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Companys internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to mark to market gains or losses related to derivative transactions, currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.11 per share. For purposes of measuring loss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be antidilutive. However, for purposes of computing Adjusted 120 Table of Contents EPS (a non GAAP measure), the Company has included the impact of dilutive common stock equivalents as the inclusion of the defined adjustments result in income for Adjusted EPS. The table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in GAAP diluted earnings per share to the weighted average shares used in calculating the non GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Reconciliation of Denominator used for Adjusted Earnings Per Share Loss Shares $ per Share GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Loss from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders $ (86 ) 769 $ (0.11 ) EFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES Stock options 2 Restricted stock units 3 NON GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE $ (86 ) 774 $ (0.11 ) Year Ended December 31, Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share 2010 2009 2008 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 Derivative mark to market (gains) losses(1) (0.01 ) 0.02 0.05 Currency transaction (gains) losses(2) (0.04 ) (0.04 ) 0.17 Disposition/acquisition (gains) losses (3) (0.19 )(4) (1.27 )(5) Impairment losses 1.07 (6) 0.21 (7) 0.13 (8) Debt retirement (gains) losses 0.03 (9) 0.25 (10) Adjusted earnings per share $ 0.94 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 (1) Derivative mark to market (gains) losses were net of income tax per share of $0.00, $0.01 and $0.00 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Managements Priorities Management continues to focus on the following priorities: Execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy including funds received in 2010 from asset and equity sales: investing in value accretive projects; delevering to increase financial flexibility, reduce risk and to create future borrowing capacity; and executing its stock repurchase program; from July through December 2010 we have repurchased a total of $99 million, or approximately 8.4 million shares of AES common stock, at an average price per share of $11.86, including commissions. Improvement of operations in the existing portfolio; Achieve cost savings through the alignment of overhead costs with business requirements, systems automation and optimal allocation of business development spending; Strategic portfolio management of existing projects including restructuring and potential sales of certain North American generation subsidiaries; Completion of an approximately 1,300 MW active construction program on time and within budget; Achieving commercial operation at Maritza in Bulgaria. At the end of 2010, the Company experienced certain commissioning delays, as further described in Key Trends and Uncertainties Development below; and 122 Table of Contents Integration of new projects. During 2010, the following projects were acquired or commenced commercial operations: Project Location Fuel GrossMW AES Equity Interest(Percent, Rounded) Ballylumford United Kingdom Gas 1,246 100 % JHRH(1) China Hydro 379 35 % Nueva Ventanas Chile Coal 272 71 % St. Nikola Bulgaria Wind 156 89 % Guacolda 4(2) Chile Coal 152 35 % Dong Qi(3) China Wind 49 49 % Huanghua II(3) China Wind 49 49 % St. Patrick France Wind 35 100 % North Rhins Scotland Wind 22 100 % Kepezkaya Turkey Hydro 28 51 % Damlapinar(4) Turkey Hydro 16 51 % (1) Jianghe Rural Electrification Development Co.

Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Some of these challenges are also described above in Key Drivers of Results in 2010. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. Development. During the past year, the Company has successfully acquired and completed construction of a number of projects, totaling approximately 2,404 MW, including the acquisition of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom and completion of construction of a number of projects in Europe, Chile and China. However, as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties of this Form 10 K, our development projects are subject to uncertainties. Certain delays have occurred at the 670 MW Maritza coal fired project in Bulgaria, and the project has not yet begun commercial operations. As noted in Note 10 Debt included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, as a result of these delays the project debt is in default and the Company is working with its lenders to resolve the default. In addition, as noted in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company is in litigation with the contractor regarding the cause of delays. At this time, we believe that Maritza will commence commercial operations for at least some of the projects capacity by the second half of 2011. However, commencement of commercial operations could be delayed beyond this time frame. There can be no assurance that Maritza will achieve commercial operations, in whole or in part, by the second half of 2011, resolve the default with the lenders or prevail in the litigation referenced above, which could result in the loss of some or all of our investment or require additional funding for the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results or financial position. Global Economic Conditions. During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Although the economic conditions in several of these countries have improved in recent months, our businesses could be impacted in the event these recent trends do not continue. 123 Table of Contents Our business or results of operations could be impacted if our subsidiaries are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all, are unable to raise funds through the sale of assets or are otherwise unable to finance or refinance their activities. The Company could also be adversely affected if capital market disruptions result in increased borrowing costs (including with respect to interest payments on the Companys or our subsidiaries variable rate debt) or if commodity prices affect the profitability of our plants or their ability to continue operations. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if general economic or political conditions in the markets where our subsidiaries operate deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the availability and or an increase in the cost of capital, or if the value of our assets remain depressed or decline further. Any of the foregoing events or a combination thereof could have a material impact on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, financial covenants, and or its credit rating. Our subsidiaries are subject to credit risk, which includes risk related to the ability of counterparties (such as parties to our PPAs, fuel supply agreements, hedging agreements and other contractual arrangements) to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price or to satisfy their financial or other contractual obligations. The Company has not suffered any material effects related to its counterparties during 2010. However, if macroeconomic conditions impact our counterparties, they may be unable to meet their commitments which could result in the loss of favorable contractual positions, which could have a material impact on our business. In addition, during the past year, certain European countries have faced a sovereign debt crisis and it is possible that other nations could be affected. This crisis has resulted in an increased risk of default by governments and the implementation of austerity measures in countries. If the crisis continues, worsens, or spreads, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company. Our businesses may be impacted if they are unable to access the capital markets, face increased taxes or labor costs, or if governments fail to fulfill their obligations to us or adopt austerity measures which adversely impact our projects. In addition, as noted in the Risk Factor entitled, Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges, our renewables businesses are dependent on favorable regulatory incentives, including subsidies, which are provided by sovereign governments. If these subsidies or other incentives are reduced or repealed, or sovereign governments are unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments or maintain favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, in whole or in part, this could impact the ability of the affected businesses to continue to grow their operations. For example, the Spanish government recently issued a decree which limits the feed in tariff and number of photovoltaic hours eligible for the tariff, which could adversely impact AES Solar in Spain. For further information on the decree see Item 1. Regulatory Spain of this Form 10 K. In addition, any of the foregoing could also impact contractual counterparties of our subsidiaries in core power or renewables. If such counterparties are adversely impacted, then they may be unable to meet their commitments to our subsidiaries. For further information on the importance of long term contracts and our counterparty credit risk, see the Risk Factor from this Form 10 K titled, We may not be able to enter into long term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. As a result of any of the foregoing events, we may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. The Companys investment in AES Solar, whose primary operations are in Europe, at December 31, 2010 was $312 million. For a discussion of the risks associated with commodity prices, see We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. It is also possible that commodity or power price volatility could continue to impact our financial results. As noted in Key Drivers of Results in 2010, and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk of this Form 10 K, the Companys North American businesses continue to face pressure as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, which has affected the results of certain of our coal plants in the region, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a PPA in place, but purchase 124 Table of Contents fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. If these conditions continue or worsen, these businesses may need to restructure their obligations or seek additional funding (including from the Parent) or face the possibility that they may be unable to meet their obligations and continue operations. Presently, Eastern Energy, Deepwater and Thames are seeking to restructure their financial obligations and or place certain of their plants in protective layup status to mitigate operating risks caused by high fuel costs and other competitive pressures. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. The Company presently manages its commodity risk with hedging activities to mitigate earnings volatility. However, at present in North America, dark spreads and the corresponding forward curves do not currently present an opportunity to engage in additional hedging activity for 2011. As a result, there are hedging arrangements in place for only a relatively small portion of 2011. As short term opportunities occur or should dark spreads improve, the Company may engage in additional hedging in 2011. Specifically, the operating results of the Companys Eastern Energy generation business in New York could be adversely impacted by continued higher coal prices relative to electricity prices if hedging continues to be uneconomic. If global economic conditions worsen, it could also affect the rates we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our rates based on prevailing market conditions as PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual rate or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. Impairments. Long lived assets. The global economic conditions and other adverse factors discussed above heighten the risk of a significant asset impairment. Examples of conditions that could be indicative of impairment which would require us to evaluate the recovery of a long lived asset or asset group include: current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset group; a significant adverse change in legal factors, including changes in environmental or other regulations or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used or in its physical condition. As further described in Item 1. Regulatory Matters United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR) had the right to require the termination of the long term PPAs under which Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom, supplies electricity to NIE Energy as early as 2010. One of the conditions to the early termination was 180 days notice, which was provided to Kilroot on April 30, 2010. At March 31, 2010, management evaluated Kilroots long lived assets for potential impairment assuming the early termination of the PPA and concluded that no impairment existed at that time. On October 28, 2010, Kilroot received final notice from NIAUR directing Kilroot and NIE Energy to terminate the PPA effective November 1, 2010. Kilroot may not be able to replace the contract on competitive terms and, upon cancellation of the PPA effective November 1, 2010, became a merchant plant. It will operate under the gross mandatory pool of the SEM in Northern Ireland. There have been no additional impairment indicators since March 31, 2010. AES Eastern Energy (AEE) operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. 125 Table of Contents The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated an impairment evaluation of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW petroleum coke (pet coke) fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and a recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 126 Table of Contents 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time, since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and what form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations. This was considered as an impairment indicator for the long lived asset groups. The recoverability test of the long lived asset groups indicated that the carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying amount of the Huntington Beach asset group exceeded its fair value by $200 million which was recognized as an impairment expense. The carrying amounts of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach long lived asset groups were determined to be recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis at September 30, 2010 and no impairment was necessary. During the third quarter of 2010, we also recognized impairment on the long lived assets at our Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. Tisza II operates under an annual contract with an off taker. In the third quarter of 2010, when Tisza II began the negotiation of its 2011 contract, future undiscounted cash flows of the plant were no longer expected to recover the long lived assets groups carrying amount due to prevailing market rates, higher generation costs and lower demand expectations. Accordingly, the Company measured the fair value of the long lived asset group and recorded an impairment expense of $85 million, representing the excess of carrying amount over the fair value at September 30, 2010. Goodwill. The Company seeks business acquisitions as one of its growth strategies. We have achieved significant growth in the past as a result of several business acquisitions, which also resulted in the recognition of goodwill. As noted in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10 K, there is always a risk that Our acquisitions may not perform as expected. The benefits of goodwill are typically realized through the future operating results of an acquired business. Management believes that the recoverability of goodwill is positively correlated with the economic environments in which our acquired businesses operate and a severe economic downturn could negatively impact the recoverability of goodwill. Also, the evolving environmental regulations, including GHG regulations, around the globe continue to increase the operating costs of our generation businesses. In extreme situations, the environmental regulations could even make a once profitable business uneconomical. In addition, most of our generation businesses have a finite life and as the acquired businesses reach the end of their finite lives, the carrying amount of goodwill is gradually recovered through their periodic operating results. The accounting guidance, however, prohibits the systematic amortization of goodwill and rather requires an annual impairment evaluation. Thus, as some of our acquired businesses approach the end of their finite lives, they may incur goodwill impairment charges even if there are no discrete adverse changes in the economic environment. As noted in Long lived assets above, adverse market conditions at Deepwater were also considered an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. Accordingly, in the second and third quarters of 2010, interim 127 Table of Contents goodwill impairment evaluations were performed at the Deepwater reporting unit level. The reporting unit passed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation in the second quarter and no impairment was recognized. In the third quarter, however, the reporting unit failed Step 1 of goodwill impairment evaluation. Upon measurement of impairment loss in Step 2, the entire $18 million goodwill balance was considered impaired and recognized as goodwill impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation and did not have any reporting units that were considered at risk. A reporting unit is considered at risk when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. While there were no potential impairment indicators that could result in the recognition of goodwill impairment for any of these reporting units, it is possible we may incur goodwill impairment on these reporting units in future years if any of the following events occur: a significant adverse change in business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a sale of assets at less than carrying amount, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, an acquisition not performing as expected, changing environmental regulations that significantly increase the cost of doing business, or a business reaches the end of its finite life. The likelihood of the occurrence of these events may increase because of the challenging global macroeconomic conditions. Regulatory Environment. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion byproducts), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter and mercury. For a description of material regulations faced by the Company, see Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our United States or international subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies and Regulators, politicians, non governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows set forth in this Form 10 K. Recent Events Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company continued to repurchase stock under the stock repurchase program announced on July 7, 2010. The Company has repurchased 1,026,610 shares at a cost of $13 million in 2011, bringing the cumulative total through February 22, 2010 to 9,409,435 shares at a total cost of $112 million (average price of $11.92 per share including commissions). As of February 25, 2011, $388 million of the $500 million authorized remained available under the stock repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 14 Equity. On February 1, 2011, AES Thames, LLC (Thames), our 208 MW coal fired plant in Connecticut, filed petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy is due, in part, to the increased cost of energy production. The bankruptcy protection is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or the results of operations. 128 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, Results of operations 2010 2009 2008 $ change2010 vs. 2009 $ change2009 vs. 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: Latin America Generation $ 4,281 $ 3,651 $ 4,468 $ 630 $ (817 ) Latin America Utilities 7,222 6,092 5,907 1,130 185 North America Generation 1,972 1,940 2,234 32 (294 ) North America Utilities 1,145 1,068 1,079 77 (11 ) Europe Generation 1,362 820 1,143 542 (323 ) Asia Generation 618 375 345 243 30 Corporate and Other(1) 1,066 870 1,012 196 (142 ) Eliminations(2) (1,019 ) (862 ) (991 ) (157 ) 129 Total Revenue $ 16,647 $ 13,954 $ 15,197 $ 2,693 $ (1,243 ) Gross Margin: Latin America Generation $ 1,497 $ 1,357 $ 1,398 $ 140 $ (41 ) Latin America Utilities 1,072 918 886 154 32 North America Generation 435 477 660 (42 ) (183 ) North America Utilities 249 239 261 10 (22 ) Europe Generation 268 212 273 56 (61 ) Asia Generation 240 93 (10 ) 147 103 Corporate and Other(3) 186 117 62 69 55 Eliminations(4) 17 20 38 (3 ) (18 ) General and administrative expenses (392 ) (339 ) (368 ) (53 ) 29 Interest expense (1,526 ) (1,485 ) (1,770 ) (41 ) 285 Interest income 411 348 519 63 (171 ) Other expense (239 ) (111 ) (161 ) (128 ) 50 Other income 108 465 375 (357 ) 90 Gain on sale of investments 131 909 (131 ) (778 ) Loss on sale of subsidiary stock (31 ) 31 Goodwill impairment (21 ) (122 ) 101 (122 ) Asset impairment expense (1,221 ) (25 ) (175 ) (1,196 ) 150 Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position (33 ) 33 (184 ) (66 ) 217 Other non operating expense (7 ) (12 ) (15 ) 5 3 Income tax expense (307 ) (599 ) (771 ) 292 172 Net equity in earnings of affiliates 183 92 33 91 59 Income from continuing operations 920 1,809 1,929 (889 ) (120 ) Income from operations of discontinued businesses 75 96 97 (21 ) (1 ) Gain (loss) from disposal of discontinued businesses 64 (150 ) 6 214 (156 ) Net income 1,059 1,755 2,032 (696 ) (277 ) Noncontrolling interests: Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,006 ) (1,099 ) (759 ) 93 (340 ) (Income) loss from discontinuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (44 ) 2 (39 ) (46 ) 41 Net income attributable to The AES Corporation $ 9 $ 658 $ 1,234 $ (649 ) $ (576 ) Per Share Data: Basic income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.75 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.69 ) Diluted income per share from continuing operations $ (0.11 ) $ 1.06 $ 1.73 $ (1.17 ) $ (0.67 ) (1) Corporate and Other includes revenue from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, Wind Generation and other renewables initiatives.

These increases were partially offset by: lower volume sold at Uruguaiana of $53 million as a result of renegotiation of its power sales agreements; lower volume due to unfavorable hydrology in Colombia and Argentina of $41 million; lower contract prices at Gener of $32 million; and lower contract prices on PPAs indexed to international coal prices in the Dominican Republic of $22 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $106 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $34 million, or 3%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher spot prices in Argentina of $69 million; higher volume and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic of $55 million; higher contract prices of $33 million in Colombia; the positive impact of $28 million resulting from the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana, as mentioned above; and higher volume of $23 million in Panama. These increases were partially offset by: higher fuel and purchased energy prices at Gener of $48 million; the net effect of lower PPA prices and higher fuel costs in the Dominican Republic of $38 million; 130 Table of Contents the impact of a reversal of bad debt expense during the first quarter of 2009 of $36 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of one of its power sales agreements; and higher fixed costs of $30 million at Gener primarily due to higher employee costs, increased maintenance expenses and costs incurred due to construction delays at Campiche. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 17% while gross margin increased 10%, primarily due to higher spot purchases and fuel prices at Gener and the reversal of bad debt expense as a result of the renegotiation of one of the power sales agreements at Uruguaiana in the first quarter of 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $181 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $636 million, or 14%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower spot and contract prices of $295 million at Gener; lower volume of $227 million at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiation of its power sales agreements in 2009 to reduce the energy volume sold; and lower energy prices and volume of $174 million in the Dominican Republic. These decreases were partially offset by: and increase of $100 million due to fewer outages at Gener and in Argentina in 2009; and higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $94 million, driven by Brazil and Argentina, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $53 million, or 4%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher prices of energy sold of $66 million at Tiet&ecirc;; fewer outages of $60 million at Gener and in Argentina; lower diesel consumption, partially offset by higher energy purchases and higher gas consumption, at Gener of $47 million; lower volume of energy purchased at Uruguaiana of $44 million as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements; and the favorable impact of $28 million of a decrease in bad debt expense at Uruguaiana as a result of the renegotiated power sales agreements. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of lower energy prices of $75 million in the Dominican Republic; lower volume and energy prices of $66 million in Argentina; higher purchased energy prices of $48 million at Uruguaiana; and lower spot sales of $48 million at Panama. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 18% while gross margin decreased 3%, primarily due to reduced energy purchases, fewer outages and lower bad debt expense. 131 Table of Contents Latin America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in Latin America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Latin America Utilities Revenue $ 7,222 $ 6,092 $ 5,907 19 % 3 % Gross Margin $ 1,072 $ 918 $ 886 17 % 4 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $697 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2010 increased $433 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $316 million, primarily in Brazil, due to increased market demand; and higher tariffs of $114 million primarily related to the July 2009 tariff reset in Brazil partially offset by the unfavorable impact on rates at Eletropaulo in Brazil of a cumulative adjustment to regulatory liabilities and higher energy prices across our Latin America utility businesses associated with energy purchases passed through to customers of $97 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $107 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $47 million, or 5%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased volume of $163 million, primarily in Brazil, due to the increased market demand; and lower contingencies of $142 million in Eletropaulo primarily related to labor contingencies which included a one time reversal, reflecting an agreement with Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o CESP, the pension plan administrator, of $51 million associated with claims for past benefit obligations which will now be accounted for as a component of the pension plan. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $238 million primarily due to the recovery in 2009 of a municipality receivable previously written off in Brazil and higher salaries and other employee related costs, provisions for commercial losses, regulatory penalties and maintenance costs; and $28 million related to the final settlement of the power sales agreement between Sul and Uruguaiana. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $442 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities revenue for 2009 increased $627 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $560 million reflecting the recovery of energy purchases of $453 million that were passed through to customers at our utilities in Brazil and El Salvador; and higher volume in Brazil of $62 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $62 million, primarily in Brazil, utilities gross margin for 2009 increased $94 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: higher tariffs of $107 million in El Salvador and Brazil; a $64 million recovery of a municipality receivable previously written off; 132 Table of Contents a non recurring PIS/COFINS fine in 2008 of $33 million; and higher volume of $32 million across the region. These increases were partially offset by: the unfavorable impact of higher fixed costs of $120 million mainly related to pension expense, labor contingencies and maintenance costs in Brazil. North America Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Generation Revenue $ 1,972 $ 1,940 $ 2,234 2 % 13 % Gross Margin $ 435 $ 477 $ 660 9 % 28 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $19 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $13 million, or 1%, from 2009 primarily due to: increased rates, volume and an availability bonus at TEG/TEP in Mexico of $41 million; higher volume, primarily due to fewer outages and higher rates, of $22 million at Merida in Mexico; higher volume of $19 million at Warrior Run in Maryland due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. These increases were partially offset by: a net decrease of $50 million in New York due to lower rates partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a net decrease of $18 million at Deepwater in Texas primarily due to lower volume; and a net decrease of $14 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $3 million, generation gross margin for 2010 decreased $45 million, or 9%, from 2009 primarily due to: a net decrease of $94 million in New York due to lower rates and higher coal prices partially offset by higher volume of electricity sold due to fewer outages; a decrease of $16 million at Deepwater due to lower volume and rates; a net decrease of $11 million in Puerto Rico primarily due to a penalty from a forced outage; a decrease of $9 million in Hawaii due to an unfavorable impact of mark to market derivatives; and a decrease of $7 million in Puerto Rico due to higher fixed costs. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase of $39 million in New York primarily due to lower fixed costs as a result of lower contract and maintenance costs, and other employee related costs; 133 Table of Contents a net increase of $26 million at TEG/TEP due to a current year availability bonus and fewer outages partially offset by higher fuel prices; higher volume of $14 million at Warrior Run due to fewer outages; and an increase of $13 million in New York due to the favorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 2% while gross margin decreased 9%, primarily due to the change in rates in New York having a greater impact on gross margin than revenue. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $44 million, primarily in Mexico, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $250 million, or 11%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $107 million in New York due to a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a decrease of $80 million due to a reduction in natural gas prices at Merida; increased outages of $22 million, $21 million and $17 million at Warrior Run, TEG/TEP and New York, respectively; lower rates of $20 million at Deepwater; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives in New York of $11 million; and the unfavorable impact in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $9 million, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $174 million, or 26%, from 2008 primarily due to: a net decrease of $72 million in New York driven by a reduction in the volume of electricity sold in the spot market as a result of lower spot rates, partially offset by a rate increase on electricity sold under favorable contracts; a $29 million unfavorable impact of mark to market derivative adjustments on coal supply contracts in Hawaii as a result of a gain of $22 million in 2008 compared to a loss of $7 million in 2009; an increase in outages of $22 million and $6 million at Warrior Run and in New York, respectively; the unfavorable impact of commodity derivatives of $11 million and higher emission allowance purchases of $13 million in New York; and the unfavorable impact of $9 million in 2009 of derivative amortization at Warrior Run. These decreases were partially offset by: a $15 million revenue adjustment at Merida in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 13% while gross margin decreased 28%, primarily due to the increase in coal prices in New York and the unfavorable impact of derivatives in 2009 in Hawaii that had no corresponding impact on revenue. 134 Table of Contents North America Utilities The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) North America Utilities Revenue $ 1,145 $ 1,068 $ 1,079 7 % 1 % Gross Margin $ 249 $ 239 $ 261 4 % 8 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Utilities revenue for 2010 increased $77 million, or 7%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail demand of $64 million as a result of warmer weather and higher fuel adjustment charges; and increased wholesale revenue of $11 million primarily due to higher prices. Utilities gross margin for 2010 increased $10 million, or 4%, from 2009 primarily due to: higher retail margin of $20 million due to increased demand; lower pension expense of $12 million; and lower emission allowance expense of $5 million. These increases were partially offset by: increased maintenance expenses of $16 million due to the timing of major generating unit overhauls; and increased fixed costs of $14 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased by 7% while gross margin increased 4%, primarily due to increased fuel and maintenance costs. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Utilities revenue for 2009 decreased $11 million, or 1%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower retail volume of $31 million due primarily to milder weather and the economic recession; and decreased wholesale revenue of $7 million driven by lower market prices. These decreases were partially offset by: $32 million of voluntary credits IPL provided to retail customers in 2008. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters North America of this Form 10 K for further information regarding these credits. Utilities gross margin for 2009 decreased $22 million, or 8%, from 2008 primarily due to: decreased wholesale margin of $16 million due to unfavorable prices; and increased pension expense of $25 million largely due to the decline in market value of IPLs pension assets during 2008. 135 Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by: increased retail margin of $15 million, primarily due to the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, partially offset by lower retail sales volumes in 2009; and decreased property tax expense of $5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue decreased by 1% while gross margin decreased 8%, primarily due to the $25 million increase in pension expense and the $32 million of voluntary customer credits IPL issued to its retail customers in 2008, both of which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. Europe Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Europe for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Europe Generation Revenue $ 1,362 $ 820 $ 1,143 66 % 28 % Gross Margin $ 268 $ 212 $ 273 26 % 22 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $41 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $583 million, or 71%, from 2009 primarily due to: $409 million from the adoption of new accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) which resulted in the consolidation of Cartagena in Spain, a generation business previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting; $117 million from the operations of Ballylumford in the United Kingdom, which was acquired in August 2010; $16 million from a full year of combined cycle operations at our Amman East plant in Jordan, which was single cycle until August 2009; higher tariffs of $16 million at Altai in Kazakhstan; higher volume of $15 million at Kilroot in the United Kingdom largely driven by coal pass through and increased demand, partially offset by lower capacity revenue due to the termination of the long term PPA and related supplementary agreements. These increases were partially offset by: lower volume and sales of emissions allowances in Hungary of $16 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $1 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $57 million, or 27%, from 2009 primarily due to: $62 million from the consolidation of Cartagena as discussed above; higher tariffs and lower fixed costs at Altai of $29 million; and $13 million from the operations of Ballylumford since its acquisition. 136 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: lower gross margin of $28 million primarily from the termination of the long term PPA at Kilroot; and lower gross margin of $20 million in Hungary primarily attributable to higher fuel costs that could not be passed through and lower sales of emission allowances. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 66% while gross margin increased 26%, primarily due to the consolidation of Cartagena and acquisition of Ballylumford that have a larger positive impact on revenue than gross margin, and the positive impact of higher energy revenue at Kilroot, which as a pass through had no corresponding impact on gross margin. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $146 million, driven mainly by Kilroot, Hungary and Kazakhstan, generation revenue for 2009 decreased $177 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower revenue of $101 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower volume of $81 million in Hungary due to the combined impact of the cancellation of one of our PPAs and reduced demand; and lower volume of $67 million at Kilroot, a coal fired plant, mainly driven by lower dispatch due to favorable gas prices compared to coal. These decreases were partially offset by: the benefit of new business of $50 million at Amman East, which commenced single cycle operations in July 2008; and higher rates of $15 million in Kazakhstan. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $35 million, driven mainly by Kilroot and Kazakhstan, generation gross margin for 2009 decreased $26 million, or 10%, from 2008 primarily due to: lower gross margin of $41 million as a result of the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in May 2008; lower demand of $12 million in Hungary; and an overall increase of $22 million in fixed costs across the region. These decreases were partially offset by: higher capacity revenue at Kilroot; higher energy prices in Kazakhstan; and the benefit of new business at Amman East. Asia Generation The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Asia for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Asia Generation Revenue $ 618 $ 375 $ 345 65 % 9 % Gross Margin $ 240 $ 93 $ (10 ) 158 % 1030 % 137 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $28 million, generation revenue for 2010 increased $215 million, or 57%, from 2009 primarily due to: favorable generation rates and volume of $210 million at Masinloc in the Philippines as a result of increased market demand and improved plant availability subsequent to the completion of its overhaul at the beginning of 2010; and higher demand from both new and existing contract and spot customers as a result of lower supply shortages in the Philippines power market due to a strong energy growth rate. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $13 million, generation gross margin for 2010 increased $134 million, or 144%, from 2009 primarily due to a combination of higher availability attributable to improved plant operations, higher market demand and favorable spot prices at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue increased 65% while gross margin increased 158%, primarily due to the positive influence on gross margin due to favorable spot rates and operational efficiencies resulting from the Masinloc plant overhauls in late 2009 and early 2010, which led to higher availability and allowed for more efficient operations that have materially improved the operating results for 2010 as compared to 2009. Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $23 million, primarily in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, generation revenue for 2009 increased $53 million, or 15%, from 2008 primarily due to: the benefit of $46 million of our new business Masinloc, which was acquired in April 2008; increased revenue of $70 million in 2009 at Masinloc due to improved rates and volume as a result of improved availability and new customer contracts; and $18 million from a one time favorable energy sales settlement at Masinloc. These increases were partially offset by: the decrease in revenue of $71 million at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka primarily due to a decline in fuel costs which are largely passed through to the customer and higher outages in 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by higher capacity revenue. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $6 million, primarily in the Philippines, generation gross margin for 2009 increased $109 million, or 1,090%, from 2008 primarily due to: the impact of our new business at Masinloc of $23 million; a $91 million increase at Masinloc due to higher contract sales, where margins are more favorable than spot sales, lower fuel prices, improved availability and the favorable energy sales settlement described above; and higher capacity revenue at Kelanitissa of $10 million. These increases were partially offset by: higher fixed costs of $20 million at Masinloc. For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue increased 9% while gross margin increased 1,030%, primarily due to higher contract margins at Masinloc as a result of improved operations, availability and lower fuel prices, as well as the larger relative impact on gross margin from the one time favorable energy sales settlement described above. 138 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Corporate and other includes the net operating results from our generation and utilities businesses in Africa, utilities businesses in Europe, AES Wind Generation and renewables projects which are immaterial for the purposes of separate segment disclosure. The following table excludes inter segment activity and summarizes revenue and gross margin for Corporate and Other entities for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % Change2010 vs. 2009 % Change2009 vs. 2008 ($s in millions) Revenue Europe Utilities $ 356 $ 286 $ 403 24 % 29 % Africa Utilities 422 370 379 14 % 2 % Africa Generation 61 65 65 6 % 0 % Wind Generation 202 133 128 52 % 4 % Corp/Other 25 16 37 56 % 57 % Total Corporate and Other $ 1,066 $ 870 $ 1,012 23 % 14 % Gross Margin Europe Utilities $ 21 $ 16 $ 34 31 % 53 % Africa Utilities 65 71 30 8 % 137 % Africa Generation 54 41 28 32 % 46 % Wind Generation 44 11 19 300 % 42 % Corp/Other 2 (22 ) (49 ) 109 % 55 % Total Corporate and Other $ 186 $ 117 $ 62 59 % 89 % Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $30 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other revenue increased $226 million for 2010, or 26% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: higher volume at our utility businesses in Ukraine driven by an overall increase in market demand; higher volume and utility tariffs at Sonel in Cameroon driven by an increase in market demand; and incremental revenue from new wind generation projects that commenced operations during the year and an overall volume increase across our wind businesses. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $8 million, primarily in Cameroon, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $77 million for 2010, or 66% from 2009. The increase was primarily due to: an increase in gross margin from our new wind generation projects and higher volume, as discussed above; and an increase in volume at Dibamba, our generation business, in Cameroon. These increases were partially offset by: an increase in fixed costs at Sonel. 139 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $162 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other revenue increased $20 million for 2009, or 2%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: higher tariffs in Ukraine of $27 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $12 million, primarily in Ukraine, Corporate and Other gross margin increased $67 million for 2009, or 108%, from 2008. The increase was primarily due to: a decrease in fixed costs across the Africa region. The increase was partially offset by: higher fuel consumption attributable to lower hydrology at Sonel. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense includes those expenses related to corporate and region staff functions and or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems, and development costs. General and administrative expenses increased $53 million, or 16%, to $392 million in 2010 from 2009. The increase is primarily related to business development costs associated with increased development efforts, primarily in Europe, Turkey and India. General and administrative expenses decreased $29 million, or 8%, to $339 million in 2009 from 2008. The decrease is primarily related to 2008 professional fees associated with remediation efforts and a reduction in business development costs. The favorable variance is partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the worldwide implementation of SAP. Interest expense Interest expense increased $41 million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to interest expense at Cartagena which is now a consolidated entity, higher interest rates at Tiet&ecirc;, increased debt principal at Eletropaulo and interest being expensed related to St. Nikola, our wind project in Bulgaria, due to commencement of operations in 2010. These increases were partially offset by reduced debt principal at the Parent Company. Interest expense decreased $285 million, or 16%, to $1.5 billion in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates globally due to economic conditions and inflationary adjustments to the market price index in Brazil. In addition, interest expense decreased as a result of favorable foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil and lower interest expenses associated with decreased debt balances at Eletropaulo. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense at Masinloc in the Philippines which was acquired in April 2008, and interest expense at Infovias in Brazil where a fee on a non exercised credit line was written off. Interest income Interest income increased $63 million, or 18%, to $411 million in 2010 from 2009. This increase was primarily due to a higher average balance in short term investments at Eletropaulo and the favorable impact of 140 Table of Contents foreign currency translation in Brazil as well as the settlement of a dispute related to inflation adjustments for energy sales at Tiet&ecirc;. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest income from a loan to a wind development project in Brazil which was repaid in June 2010. Interest income decreased $171 million, or 33%, to $348 million in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances in Brazil, unfavorable foreign currency translation in Brazil, the impact of decreased interest rates and inflationary adjustments on accounts receivable in 2008 at Gener in Chile and a decreased cash balance at the Parent Company. Other income Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Gain on extinguishment of tax and other liabilities $ 65 $ 168 $ 199 Tax credit settlement 129 Performance incentive fee 80 Insurance proceeds 40 Gain on sale of assets 12 14 34 Other 31 74 102 Total other income $ 108 $ 465 $ 375 Other income of $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to the extinguishment of a swap liability owed by two of our Brazilian subsidiaries, resulting in the recognition of a $62 million gain. The net impact to the Company after taxes and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Other income also included a gain on sale of assets at Eletropaulo. Other income of $465 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $165 million from the reduction in interest and penalties associated with federal tax debts at Eletropaulo and Sul as a result of the REFIS program and a $129 million gain related to a favorable court decision enabling Eletropaulo to receive reimbursement of excess non income taxes paid from 1989 to 1992 in the form of tax credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. The net impact to the Company after income taxes and noncontrolling interests for these items was $44 million. In addition, the Company recognized income in 2009 of $80 million from a performance incentive bonus for management services provided to Ekibastuz and Maikuben in 2008. The management agreement was related to the sale of these businesses in Kazakhstan in May 2008; see further discussion of this transaction in Note 22 Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Other income of $375 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included gains on the extinguishment of a gross receipts tax liability and a legal contingency at Eletropaulo of $117 million and $75 million, respectively, $32 million of cash proceeds related to a favorable legal settlement at Southland in California, $29 million of insurance recoveries for damaged turbines at Uruguaiana, $23 million of gains associated with a sale of land at Eletropaulo and sales of turbines at Itabo, and compensation of $18 million for the impairment associated with the settlement agreement to shut down Hefei. 141 Table of Contents Other expense Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Loss on sale and disposal of assets $ 84 $ 42 $ 34 Gener gas settlement 72 Loss on extinguishment of debt 37 70 AES Wind transaction costs 22 Other 24 69 57 Total other expense $ 239 $ 111 $ 161 Other expense of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $72 million for a settlement agreement of gas transportation contracts at Gener. There were also previously capitalized transaction costs of $22 million that were incurred in connection with the preparation for the sale of a noncontrolling interest in our Wind Generation business which were written off upon the expiration of the letter of intent in June 2010. In addition, there were losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo, Panama, and Gener, an $18 million loss on debt extinguishment at Andres and Itabo and a $15 million loss at the Parent Company from the retirement of senior notes. Other expense of $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $13 million loss recognized when three of our businesses in the Dominican Republic received $110 million par value bonds issued by the Dominican Republic government to settle existing accounts receivable for the same amount from the government owned distribution companies. The loss represented an adjustment to reflect the fair value of the bonds on the date received. Other expense also included losses on the disposal of assets at Eletropaulo and Andres and contingencies at our businesses in Kazakhstan and Alicura in Argentina. Other expense of $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $69 million of losses on the retirement of debt at the Parent Company in connection with the refinancing in June 2008 and IPALCO associated with a $375 million refinancing in April 2008 and losses on disposal of assets primarily at Eletropaulo. Goodwill Impairment In 2010, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2010, Deepwater, our pet coke fired merchant generation facility in Texas, determined that there was an interim impairment indicator for its goodwill. This determination was primarily based on managements decision not to operate the plant for more than 30 days in the third quarter of 2010, current operating and cash flow losses, and forecasted operating and cash flow losses for the remainder of 2010 through 2014 as a result of declining trends in energy pricing curves and increasing pet coke prices. As a result, Deepwater recognized a goodwill impairment of $18 million. Deepwater is reported in the North America Generation segment. In 2009, the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $122 million. This was a result of impairment at certain of our businesses in the United Kingdom and Ukraine as a result of the Companys annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of October 1. The most significant goodwill impairment was at Kilroot, our generation business in the United Kingdom. Factors contributing to the recognition of impairment included: reduced profit expectations based on latest estimates of future commodity prices and reduced expectations on the recovery of cash flows on the existing plant following the Companys decision to forgo capital expenditures to meet emission allowance requirements taking effect in 2024. The fair value of the Companys reporting units are inherently sensitive to the assumptions underlying the estimates of fair value. Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Fair Value, Goodwill and Intangibles in Item 8 of this Form 10 K provides a 142 Table of Contents more detailed discussion of those assumptions. As discussed in Key Trends and Uncertainties, in the future, the fair values of the Companys reporting units might decline as a result of adverse changes in their operating environments or the businesses reaching the end of their finite lives, which could require the Company to record additional goodwill impairment charges. The Company did not incur any goodwill impairment charges in 2008. Asset Impairment Expense As discussed in Note 19 Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, asset impairment expense for the year 2010 was $1,221 million and consisted primarily of the following: Eastern Energy AEE operates four coal fired power plants: Cayuga, Greenidge, Somerset and Westover, representing generation capacity of 1,169 MW in the western New York power market. During 2010, the power prices in the New York power market trended downward, similar to North America natural gas prices. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) continues to move forward with the potential addition of a new capacity zone, which is expected to put further downward pressure on the capacity prices paid to the AEE facilities. In November 2010, legislation was proposed in the state of New Jersey for the addition of state subsidized capacity additions serving to lower PJM capacity price expectations. Similar changes to capacity pricing may be made in the future in New York. Continued pressure on energy prices, driven by falling natural gas prices and state actions, indicate that capacity prices are unlikely to reach levels significantly in excess of those achieved historically. Accordingly, managements view of long term capacity markets in western New York was revised downward. In December 2010, management revised its cash flow forecasts based on these developments and forecasted continuing negative operating cash flow and losses through 2034. The forecasted energy prices are such that a hedge strategy significantly beyond those in place at December 31, 2010 would not be economical. Additionally, on November 15, 2010, Standard & Poors downgraded the bond rating of AEE from BB to B+. Collectively, in the fourth quarter of 2010, these events were considered an impairment indicator for the AES New York asset group, of which AEE is the most significant component and necessitated a recoverability test of the asset group. The long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include all of the generating plants of AEE. This determination was based on the assessment of the plants inability to generate independent cash flow. When the recoverability test of the asset group was performed, management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. While there were numerous assumptions that impact the fair value, potential state actions that impact capacity pricing and forward energy prices were the most significant. In determining the fair value of the asset group, the three valuation approaches prescribed by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value. Any salvage value of the asset group is expected to be offset by environmental and other remediation costs. Accordingly, the long lived asset group was considered fully impaired and $827 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Southland In May 2010, the California State Water Board approved a policy to reduce the number of marine animals killed by seawater cooling systems in coastal power plants in California. At that time since the policy required the approval of Californias Office of Administrative Law, it was unclear whether the policy would be approved and the exact form the regulations would take. In September 2010, the Office of Administrative Law in California approved the policy that will require the Company to change the process 143 Table of Contents through which it uses ocean water to cool the generation turbines at its Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach (collectively Southland) gas fired generation facilities in California. The policy requires compliance with the new regulations by December 31, 2020. The change in the water cooling process will result in significant future capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the new regulations and the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. The Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment. The asset group was determined to be at the individual plant level and based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined that the Huntington Beach asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the Huntington Beach asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. To assist management in determining the fair value of the asset group, an independent valuation firm was engaged. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. The carrying value of the Huntington Beach plant of $288 million exceeded the fair value of $88 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $200 million. The undiscounted cash flows of the Alamitos and Redondo Beach generation facilities exceeded their respective carrying values and resulted in no impairment. Huntington Beach is reported in the North America Generation reportable segment. Tisza II During the third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into annual negotiations with the offtaker of its Tisza II generation plant in Hungary. As a result of these preliminary negotiations, as well as the further deterioration of the economic environment in Hungary, the Company determined that an indicator of impairment existed at September 30, 2010. Thus, the Company performed an asset impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and determined that based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount of the Tisza II asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the asset group was then determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The carrying value of the Tisza II asset group of $160 million exceeded the fair value of $75 million resulting in the recognition of asset impairment expense of $85 million. Tisza II is reported in the Europe Generation reportable segment. Deepwater In March 2010, Deepwater, our 160 MW pet coke fired merchant power plant located in Texas, experienced deteriorating market conditions due to increasing pet coke prices and diminishing power prices. As a result, Deepwater incurred an operating loss for the period and forecasted short term losses. These conditions gradually worsened in the second quarter of 2010 and management determined it could not operate the plant at certain times during the year without generating negative operating margin. As the contraction of energy margin continued in the second quarter of 2010, management determined the collective events to be an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test for the long lived asset group. Based on the results of these tests, in the second quarter of 2010, management concluded no impairment was necessary. In the third quarter of 2010, these downward trends continued and management, after determining that there was an indicator of impairment, performed another impairment evaluation of Deepwaters goodwill and recoverability test of the long lived asset group. The results in the third quarter indicated no impairment was necessary for the asset group, but the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was deemed to be impaired and the $18 million goodwill balance was written off during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, further adverse trends in energy and pet coke pricing curves were observed in managements review of external market analyses. The most significant impact on the forecasted energy prices reviewed by management in November 2010 related to the general external market consensus that Federal CO2 cap and trade legislation was less likely, resulting in a drop in long term energy price projections. At that time, Deepwaters revised forecasts indicated that Deepwater would have operating losses which would extend beyond 2020 and negative cash flows through 2019. Management concluded that, on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the carrying amount of the asset group was no longer recoverable. To measure the amount of impairment loss, management was required to determine the fair value of the asset group. To this end, an independent valuation firm was engaged to assist management in its estimation of fair value. Cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions for the valuation were developed by management. In determining the fair value of the asset group, 144 Table of Contents all three valuation approaches described by the fair value measurement accounting guidance were considered. The fair value under the income approach was considered most appropriate. On that basis, the carrying value of the asset group was determined to be impaired and $79 million of impairment expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. Asset impairment expense for the year 2009 was $25 million. In 2009, the Company recognized a pre tax long lived asset impairment charge of $11 million related to the Companys Piabanha hydro project in Brazil. The Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows and abandoned the project. Asset impairment expense for the year 2008 was $175 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, the Company reviewed and prioritized projects in the development pipeline. From this review, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows for certain projects. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $75 million ($34 million, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes) related to two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non power development project at one of our facilities in North America. During 2008, the Company recognized additional impairment charges of $36 million related to long lived assets at Uruguaiana. The impairment was triggered by a combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy in 2007 that continued in 2008. Following an initial impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, further charges were incurred in 2008 due to fixed asset purchase agreements in place. During the first half of 2008, the Company withdrew from projects in South Africa and Israel which resulted in impairment charges of $36 million. The Company also recognized an impairment of $18 million related to the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China. Gain on sale of investments There was no gain on sale of investments in 2010. Gain on sale of investments of $131 million in 2009 consisted primarily of $98 million recognized in May 2009 related to the termination of the management agreement between the Company and Kazakhmys PLC for Ekibastuz and Maikuben, a gain of $14 million from the sale of the remaining assets associated with the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China and $13 million from the reversal of a contingent liability related to the Kazakhstan sale in 2008. Gain on sale of investments of $909 million in 2008 consisted primarily of the sale in May 2008 of two wholly owned subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Ekibastuz and Maikuben for a net gain of $905 million. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock There was no loss on sale of subsidiary stock in 2010 or 2009. Loss on sale of subsidiary stock of $31 million in 2008 was the result of sales of AES Gener shares made by our wholly owned subsidiary Cachagua. In November 2008, Cachagua sold 9.6% of its ownership in Gener to a third party reducing its ownership in Gener to 70.6%. 145 Table of Contents Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Companys net monetary position from foreign currency transaction activities: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) AES Corporation $ (50 ) $ 13 $ 38 Chile 8 65 (96 ) Philippines 8 15 (57 ) Brazil (6 ) (9 ) (44 ) Argentina 12 (10 ) (28 ) Kazakhstan 1 (24 ) 14 Colombia (4 ) (11 ) 5 Other (2 ) (6 ) (16 ) Total(1) $ (33 ) $ 33 $ (184 ) (1) Includes (losses) gains of $(10) million, $(39) million and $10 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These losses consisted primarily of losses at The AES Corporation partially offset by gains in Argentina. Losses of $50 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the devaluation of notes receivable resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound, and losses on foreign exchange swaps and options, partially offset by gains on cash balances and debt denominated in British Pounds. Gains of $12 million in Argentina were primarily due to a gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso by 5%, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction gains of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These gains consisted primarily of gains in Chile, the Philippines and at The AES Corporation partially offset by losses in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. Gains of $65 million in Chile were primarily due to the appreciation of the Chilean Peso of 20% resulting in gains at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Peso, mainly cash and accounts receivables. This gain was partially offset by $14 million in losses on foreign currency derivatives. Gains of $15 million in the Philippines were primarily due to the appreciation of the Philippine Peso of 3%, resulting in gains at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on the remeasurement of U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $13 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to the settlement of the senior unsecured credit facility and the revaluation of notes receivable denominated in the Euro, partially offset by losses on debt denominated in British Pounds. Losses of $24 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar and $12 million of foreign currency transaction losses on debt and other liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Kazakh Tenge. 146 Table of Contents Losses of $11 million in Colombia were primarily due to the appreciation of the Colombian Peso of 9%, resulting in losses at Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its Colombian Peso denominated debt and losses on foreign currency derivatives. Losses of $10 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2009, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt, partially offset by derivative gains. Losses of $9 million in Brazil were primarily due to energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar, resulting in foreign currency transaction losses of $18 million, partially offset by gains of $9 million due to the appreciation in 2009 of the Brazilian Real of 25%, resulting in gains at Sul and Uruguaiana associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These losses consisted primarily of losses in Chile, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina partially offset by gains at The AES Corporation and in Kazakhstan. Losses of $96 million in Chile were primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso of 28% in 2008, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable and value added tax (VAT) receivables. Losses of $57 million in the Philippines were primarily due to remeasurement losses at Masinloc (a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary) on U.S. Dollar denominated debt resulting from depreciation of the Philippine Peso of 14% in 2008. Losses of $44 million in Brazil were primarily due to the realization of deferred exchange variance on past energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar. Losses of $28 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of 10% in 2008, resulting in losses at Alicura (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Gains of $38 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to debt denominated in British Pounds and gains on foreign exchange derivatives, partially offset by losses on notes receivable denominated in the Euro. Gains of $14 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction gains of $16 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar, offset by $5 million of foreign currency transaction losses on external and intercompany debt denominated in other than the Kazakh Tenge functional currency. Income taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $292 million, or 49%, to $307 million in 2010. The Companys effective tax rates were 29% for 2010 and 26% for 2009. The net increase in the 2010 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax expense recorded in the second quarter of 2010 relating to the CEMIG sale transaction, tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowances at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, and $165 million of non taxable income recorded in 2009 at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program. These items were offset by income tax benefits related to a reversal of withholding tax liabilities at certain Chilean subsidiaries and 2010 asset impairments primarily recorded at certain U.S. subsidiaries. Included in the net tax expense related to the CEMIG sale transaction is tax expense on the equity earnings associated with the reversal of the net long term liability and tax benefit related to release of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. 147 Table of Contents Income tax expense on continuing operations decreased $172 million, or 22%, to $599 million in 2009. The Companys effective tax rates were 26% for 2009 and 29% for 2008. The net decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefit recorded in 2009 upon the release of valuation allowance at certain U.S. and Brazilian subsidiaries, $165 million of non taxable income recorded at Brazil as a result of the REFIS program in 2009 and an increase in U.S. taxes on distributions from the Companys primary holding company in the second quarter of 2008. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $91 million, or 99%, to $183 million in 2010 from $92 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to a gain recognized upon the sale of our interest in CEMIG during the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by 2009 equity in earnings of Cartagena which was accounted for as a consolidated entity in 2010 and thus reported directly within revenues and expenses. Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $59 million, or 179%, to $92 million in 2009 from $33 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a cash settlement received by Cartagena, in Spain, in June 2009 for liquidated damages received related to a construction delay from December 2005 to November 2006; increased earnings at Guacolda in Chile mainly due to lower cost of coal; increased earnings of Chigen affiliates from higher tariffs partially offset by lower volume and a valuation write off in 2008 at an affiliate in Turkey. These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings at OPGC, in India, mainly due to lower tariff and a dividend distribution tax in March 2009 and increased expenses for an equipment overhaul at Elsta in the Netherlands. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $93 million, or 8%, to $1.0 billion in 2010 from $1.1 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to decreased earnings at Eletropaulo as a result of the absence of legal settlement income present in 2009, a loss on legal settlement at Gener and reduced revenues due to decreased coal prices along with higher electricity purchases at Itabo. These decreases were partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian Real. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $340 million, or 45%, to $1.1 billion in 2009 from $0.8 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to increases in gross margin and other income, lower interest expense and a decrease in impairments in 2009 at our Brazilian businesses, and increases in gross margin and foreign currency transaction gains at our businesses in Chile. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $44 million at certain of our wind generation businesses as a result of a charge related to the potential future taxes that could be deemed due in the calculation of the hypothetical liquidation value of certain of our wind tax equity partnerships. Discontinued operations As further discussed in Note 21 Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Businesses to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, Discontinued Operations includes the results of five businesses: Ras Laffan, a generation business in Qatar (sold in October 2010); Barka, a generation business in Oman, (sold in August 2010); Lal Pir and Pak Gen, generation businesses in Pakistan, (sold in June 2010); and Jiaozuo, a generation business in China, (sold in December 2008). Prior periods have been restated to reflect these businesses within Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. In 2010, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $39 million and reflected the operations of our 55% stake in Ras Laffan, a combined cycle gas facility and water desalination plant in Qatar, our 35% stake in Barka, a combined cycle gas 148 Table of Contents facility and water desalination plant in Oman and our 55% stake in Lal Pir and Pak Gen, two oil fired facilities in Pakistan. The sale of Lal Pir and Pak Gen closed in June 2010, resulting in additional impairment expense and a loss on the sale in 2010 of $14 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The Barka plant was sold in August 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $63 million, net of tax and noncontrolling interests. The sale of Ras Laffan closed in October 2010, resulting in a gain on sale of $6 million, net of tax. In 2009, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $54 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir and Pak Gen. Loss on disposal of discontinued businesses, net of tax and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $105 million and represented the difference between the net book value of the Companys interests in its Pakistan businesses and their estimated fair value. In 2008, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax and income attributable to noncontrolling interests, was $60 million and reflected the operations of Ras Laffan, Barka, Lal Pir, Pak Gen and Jiaozuo, a coal fired generation facility in China sold in December 2008. The Company received $73 million for its 70% interest in the business. The net gain on the disposition was $7 million. Critical Accounting Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Companys most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Reserves We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the tax jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material. 149 Table of Contents On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act). The Act includes several provisions which provide for tax relief for businesses by extending certain tax benefits and credits, including the Subpart F exception for active financing income and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look through provisions of Subpart F. This legislation resulted in a benefit for the Companys 2010 provision for income taxes; however, there can be no assurances that the benefits of this legislation will extend beyond 2011, when it is currently scheduled to expire. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Goodwill and Other Intangibles and Long lived Assets, respectively, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level on October 1. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying amount. A long lived asset (asset group) will be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e., the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are less than its carrying amount. In the event that the carrying amount of the long lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment evaluation is performed, in which the fair value of the asset is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. Examples of indicators that would result in an impairment test for goodwill and a recoverability test for long lived assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate, legislation changes or a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition. Throughout the impairment evaluation process, management makes considerable judgments; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part of an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost/benefit analysis and the Companys internal valuation knowledge of the long lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the DCF model), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factors expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. 150 Table of Contents A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Managements Discussion and Analysis, Consolidated Results of Operations Goodwill Impairment and Asset Impairment Expense and Note 19 Impairment Expense and Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Fair Value Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Companys financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent), derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long term liabilities. The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Companys investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Companys derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where 151 Table of Contents derivatives qualify and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Companys interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Companys derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterpartys) and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Platts). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instruments fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on indicative pricing quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities The Company adopted the fair value measurement accounting guidance for nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009. The most significant of these estimates surround the fair value measurement of long lived tangible and intangible assets when tested for impairment upon a triggering event or during the annual impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill. These estimates include making assumptions regarding useful life, the impact of economic obsolescence and expected future cash flows. Additional factors are discussed above in the Impairments section. 152 Table of Contents Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard creates a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest.
