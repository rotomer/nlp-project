ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those informational statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements. We desire to take advantage of these provisions. This report contains cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected herein, and in any other statements made by Company officials in communications with the financial community and contained in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Forward looking statements are not based on historical information and relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Furthermore, forward looking information is subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. In particular, statements containing words such as expect, anticipate, believe, goal, objective, may, should, estimate, intends, projects, will, assumes, potential, target, or similar words as well as specific projections of future results, generally qualify as forward looking. Aflac undertakes no obligation to update such forward looking statements. We caution readers that the following factors, in addition to other factors mentioned from time to time, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements: legislative and regulatory developments assessments for insurance company insolvencies competitive conditions in the United States and Japan new product development and customer response to new products and new marketing initiatives ability to attract and retain qualified sales associates and employees ability to repatriate profits from Japan changes in U.S. and or Japanese tax laws or accounting requirements credit and other risks associated with Aflacs investment activities significant changes in investment yield rates fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates deviations in actual experience from pricing and reserving assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity, mortality, persistency, expenses, and investment yields level and outcome of litigation downgrades in the Companys credit rating changes in rating agency policies or practices subsidiarys ability to pay dividends to the Parent Company ineffectiveness of hedging strategies catastrophic events general economic conditions in the United States and Japan II 5 Table of Contents COMPANY OVERVIEW Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (the Company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Companys insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of Aflac Incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three year period ended December 31, 2006. As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes. This MD&A is divided into four primary sections. In the first section, we discuss our critical accounting estimates. We then follow with a discussion of the results of our operations on a consolidated basis and by segment. The third section presents an analysis of our financial condition as well as a discussion of market risks of financial instruments. We conclude by addressing the availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of Aflacs results of operations and financial condition are those related to investments, deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from managements analyses and judgments. The application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 95% of our assets and 84% of our liabilities are reported and thus have a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders equity. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results. Investments Aflacs investments in debt and equity securities include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For privately issued securities, we receive pricing data from external sources that take into account each securitys credit quality and liquidity characteristics. We also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. These reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 59, Accounting for Non Current Marketable Equity Securities; Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, II 6 Table of Contents Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities; Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position 115 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments and related guidance. The identification of distressed investments, the determination of fair value if not publicly traded, and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require evaluation of factors, including but not limited to: percentage decline in value and the length of time during which the decline has occurred recoverability of principal and interest market conditions ability to hold the investment to maturity review of the issuers overall operating performance rating agency opinions and actions regarding the issuers credit standing adverse changes in the issuers availability of production resources, revenue sources and technological conditions adverse changes in the issuers economic, regulatory or political environment Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Policy Liabilities Aflacs products are generally long duration fixed benefit indemnity contracts. As such, our products are accounted for under the requirements of SFAS No. 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises. We make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business to match expected policy benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with expected policy premiums. These assumptions include persistency, morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses. If actual results match the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs, profits will emerge as a level percentage of earned premiums. However, because actual results will vary from the assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary from year to year. We measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business. Our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our DAC is recoverable. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Under the requirements of SFAS No. 60, certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policys premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income. Future amortization of DAC is based upon our estimates of persistency, interest, and future premium revenue generally established at the time of policy issuance. However, the unamortized balance of DAC reflects actual persistency. As presented in the following table, the ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has been relatively stable for Aflac U.S. over the last three years. The ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has shown a slight upward trend for Aflac Japan for the last three years. This trend is a result of a greater proportion of our annualized premiums being under the alternative commission schedule, which pays a higher commission on first year premiums and lower commissions on renewal premiums. This schedule is very popular with our new agents as it helps them with cash flow for personal and business needs as they build their II 7 Table of Contents business. While this has resulted in a higher unamortized DAC balance, the overall cost to the company has been reduced. Deferred Policy Acquisition Cost Ratios Aflac Japan Aflac U.S. (In Yen) (In Dollars) (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Deferred policy acquisition costs 459,404 427,894 397,261 $ 2,168 $ 1,966 $ 1,783 Annualized premiums in force 1,083,126 1,027,762 961,895 4,101 3,711 3,374 Deferred policy acquisition costs as a percentage of annualized premiums in force 42.4 % 41.6 % 41.3 % 52.9 % 53.0 % 52.8 % Policy Liabilities The following table provides details of policy liabilities by segment and in total as of December 31. Policy Liabilities (In millions) 2006 2005 U.S. segment: Future policy benefits $ 4,391 $ 3,780 Unpaid policy claims 816 848 Other policy liabilities 158 143 Total U.S. policy liabilities $ 5,365 $ 4,771 Japan segment: Future policy benefits $ 36,447 $ 34,071 Unpaid policy claims 1,574 1,657 Other policy liabilities 2,051 1,828 Total Japan policy liabilities $ 40,072 $ 37,556 Consolidated: Future policy benefits $ 40,841 $ 37,853 Unpaid policy claims 2,390 2,504 Other policy liabilities 2,209 1,972 Total consolidated policy liabilities $ 45,440 $ 42,329 Our policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with SFAS No. 60 and Actuarial Standards of Practice, include two primary components: future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 90% and 5% of total policy liabilities as of December 31, 2006, respectively. Future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. We calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. These assumptions are generally established at the time a policy II 8 Table of Contents is issued. The assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. As required by GAAP, we also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience. Unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us. We compute unpaid policy claims on an undiscounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. We update the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability. Our insurance products provide fixed benefit amounts that are not subject to medical cost inflation. Furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the United States and Japan. This geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. Claims incurred under Aflacs policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. The unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. Severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. Our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we increased Aflacs U.S. unpaid policy claims liability by $28 million. As part of our analysis of recent cancer claims experience, we noted that the overall duration of cancer outpatient treatments has lengthened. Since our reserving methods are designed to fully accrue each cancer outpatient treatment as of the date of initial treatment, we increased our estimate of the Aflac U.S. unpaid policy claims liability by $28 million. This change in estimate is reflected in current years earnings. If we had been using the new claims factors to produce our claim liability estimates at the end of 2005, the increase for 2006 would have been $9 million. We expect that the annual impact on future earnings will be approximately $9 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter we transferred $170 million of the Aflac U.S. unpaid policy claims liability to future policy benefits. This transfer was primarily related to new product lines where early policy duration claims have been lower than we anticipated. However, our analysis indicates that it is appropriate to hold this liability in future policy benefits. This transfer had no impact on net earnings. Also during the fourth quarter of 2006, we transferred $85 million from Aflac Japans unpaid policy claims liability to its future policy benefits liability. This transfer, which was primarily related to a continued decline in current period claims caused by changes to health care delivery in Japan, had no effect on net earnings. Our 2006 claims review indicated that we experienced a continued decline in the average number of hospital days associated with the typical cancer treatment period in Japan. We believe the average number of days declined primarily due to changes in financial incentives provided to hospitals by the government sponsored health care system in Japan to shorten the average hospital stay. However, our claims statistics also indicated that the declines in the average number of days per hospitalization are generally offset by an increase in the frequency of II 9 Table of Contents hospitalizations associated with the treatment of cancer. This shift reduced current period claims, and future period claims are anticipated to increase by similar amounts. In computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. We monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. Claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. In calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, we do not calculate a range of estimates. The following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of December 31, 2006, to changes in severity and frequency of claims. For the years 2004 through 2006, and before the effect of the fourth quarter 2006 adjustments noted above, our assumptions changed on average by approximately 1% in total, and we believe that a variation in assumptions in a range of plus or minus 1% in total is reasonably likely to occur. Sensitivity of Unpaid Policy Claims Liability (In millions) Total Severity Total Frequency Decrease by 2% Decrease by 1% Unchanged Increase by 1% Increase by 2% Increase by 2% $ $ 16 $ 31 $ 48 $ 65 Increase by 1% (16 ) 16 32 48 Unchanged (31 ) (16 ) 16 32 Decrease by 1% (47 ) (32 ) (16 ) 16 Decrease by 2% (62 ) (47 ) (31 ) (16 ) New Accounting Pronouncements During the last three years, various accounting standard setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. For information on new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. II 10 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table is a presentation of items impacting net earnings and net earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31. Items Impacting Net Earnings In Millions Per Diluted Share 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Net earnings $ 1,483 $ 1,483 $ 1,266 $ 2.95 $ 2.92 $ 2.45 Items impacting net earnings, net of tax: Realized investment gains (losses) 51 167 (5 ) .10 .33 (.01 ) Impact from SFAS 133 (10 ) (13 ) (.02 ) (.03 ) Release of deferred tax asset valuation allowance 34 128 .07 .25 Japanese pension obligation transfer 3 .01 Realized Investment Gains and Losses Our investment strategy is to invest in fixed income securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the Companys profitability. We do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and or general portfolio maintenance and rebalancing. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the principal drivers of our profitability. In 2006, we realized pretax gains of $79 million (after tax, $51 million, or $.10 per diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps and the liquidation of equity securities held by Aflac U.S. In 2005, we realized pretax gains of $262 million (after tax, $167 million, or $.33 per diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps. We began our bond swap program in the second half of 2005 and concluded it in the first half of 2006. These bond swaps took advantage of tax loss carryforwards and also resulted in an improvement in overall portfolio credit quality and investment income. During 2004, we received an issuers offer to redeem certain available for sale yen denominated debt securities held by the Company. We accepted the issuers offer of $205 million and recorded a pretax loss of $23 million. This investment loss and other investment gains and losses in the normal course of business decreased 2004 pretax earnings by $12 million (after tax, $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share). Impact from SFAS 133 We entered into cross currency swap agreements to effectively convert our dollar denominated senior notes, which mature in 2009, into a yen denominated obligation (see Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The effect of issuing fixed rate, dollar denominated debt and swapping it into fixed rate, yen denominated debt has the same economic impact on Aflac II 11 Table of Contents as if we had issued yen denominated debt of a like amount. However, the accounting treatment for cross currency swaps is different from issuing yen denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133), requires that the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of the cross currency swaps, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, be reflected in net earnings (other income). This change in fair value is determined by relative dollar and yen interest rates and has no cash impact on our results of operations. At maturity, the fair value will equal initial contract fair value, and the cumulative impact of gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the interest component will be zero. We have the ability and intent to retain the cross currency swaps until their maturity. The impact from SFAS 133 includes the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross currency swaps, which does not qualify for hedge accounting. We have also issued yen denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes. We have designated these notes as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the value of these yen denominated notes and the notional amounts of the cross currency swaps exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, we would be required to recognize the foreign currency effect on the excess, or ineffective portion, in net earnings (other income). The ineffective portion would be included in the impact from SFAS 133. These hedges were effective during the three year period ended December 31, 2006; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings. During the third quarter of 2006, we entered into interest rate swap agreements related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes (see Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). By entering into these contracts, we have been able to lock in the interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. SFAS 133 requires that the change in the fair value of the swap contracts be recorded in other comprehensive income so long as the hedge is deemed effective. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in net earnings (other income). The impact from SFAS 133 would include any ineffectiveness associated with these interest rate swaps. The fair value of these swaps and related changes in fair value were immaterial during the year ended December 31, 2006. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Nonrecurring Items We received regulatory approval for a change in the allocation of expenses under the management fee agreement between Aflac and the Parent Company in 2005. This enabled the Parent Company to fully utilize its tax basis, non life operating losses and therefore release the valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax assets, resulting in a benefit of $34 million ($.07 per diluted share) in 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 eliminated the 90% limitation on the utilization of foreign tax credits. As a result of this tax law change, we recognized a benefit of $128 million ($.25 per diluted share) in 2004 for the release of the valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax II 12 Table of Contents assets. The 2005 and 2004 tax benefits are included as reductions to income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. During 2004, we concluded the process of returning the substitutional portion of Aflac Japans pension plan to the Japanese government as allowed by the Japan Pension Insurance Law. We recognized a one time gain (other income) as the result of this transfer to the Japanese government in the amount of $6 million (after tax, $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share) in 2004. Foreign Currency Translation Aflac Japans premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen denominated assets to support yen denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. We translate Aflac Japans yen denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its yen denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our Company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, management evaluates Aflacs financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Income Taxes Our combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was 34.5% in 2006, 33.4% in 2005, and 28.6% in 2004. Total income taxes were $781 million in 2006, compared with $743 million in 2005 and $507 million in 2004. Japanese income taxes on Aflac Japans results account for most of our consolidated income tax expense. Our 2005 income tax rate was lower than normal primarily as a result of the release of the valuation allowance for non life losses discussed previously. Our 2004 income tax rate and tax expense were also lower than normal as a result of the release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets discussed previously. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. II 13 Table of Contents Earnings Guidance We communicate earnings guidance in this report based on the growth in net earnings per diluted share. However, certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of managements control may have a significant impact on actual results. Therefore, our comparison of net earnings includes certain assumptions to reflect the limitations that are inherent in projections of net earnings. In comparing year over year results, we exclude the effect of realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133 and nonrecurring items. We also assume no impact from foreign currency translation on the Aflac Japan segment and the Parent Companys yen denominated interest expense for a given year in relation to the prior year. Subject to the preceding assumptions, our objective for 2006 was to achieve net earnings per diluted share of at least $2.92, an increase of 15.0% over 2005 using the preceding assumptions. We reported 2006 net earnings per diluted share of $2.95. Adjusting that number for realized investment gains ($.10 per diluted share), the impact from SFAS 133 (nil per diluted share) and foreign currency translation (a loss of $.08 per diluted share), we exceeded our objective for the year. Our objective for 2007 is to increase net earnings per diluted share by 15% to 16% over 2006, on the basis described above. If we achieve this objective, the following table shows the likely results for 2007 net earnings per diluted share, including the impact of foreign currency translation using various yen/dollar exchange rate scenarios. 2007 Net Earnings Per Share (EPS) Scenarios* Weighted Average Yen/Dollar Exchange Rate Net Earnings Per Diluted Share % Growth Over 2006 Yen Impact on EPS 105.00 $ 3.45 3.48 21.1 22.1 % $ .17 110.00 3.37 3.40 18.2 19.3 .09 116.31** 3.28 3.31 15.1 16.1 120.00 3.23 3.26 13.3 14.4 (.05 ) 125.00 3.17 3.20 11.2 12.3 (.11 ) *Excludes realized investment gains/losses, impact from SFAS 133 and nonrecurring items in 2007 and 2006 **Actual 2006 weighted average exchange rate INSURANCE OPERATIONS Aflacs insurance business consists of two segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. Aflac Japan, which operates as a branch of Aflac, is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. GAAP financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual financial statements. Furthermore, we are required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets. We measure and evaluate our insurance segments financial performance using operating earnings on a pretax basis. We define segment operating earnings as the profits we derive from our II 14 Table of Contents operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. We believe that an analysis of segment pretax operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is conducted in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars. We evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales, an industry operating measure. Total new annualized premium sales, which include new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, represent the premiums that we would collect over a 12 month period, assuming the policies remain in force. Premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period. II 15 Table of Contents AFLAC JAPAN SEGMENT Aflac Japan Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac Japans pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency, and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan Summary of Operating Results (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Premium income $ 8,762 $ 8,745 $ 8,368 Net investment income: Yen denominated investment income 1,064 1,111 1,087 Dollar denominated investment income 624 524 470 Net investment income 1,688 1,635 1,557 Other income 25 31 18 Total operating revenues 10,475 10,411 9,943 Benefits and claims 6,847 6,898 6,679 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 285 284 274 Insurance commissions 859 892 881 Insurance and other expenses 832 822 730 Total operating expenses 1,976 1,998 1,885 Total benefits and expenses 8,823 8,896 8,564 Pretax operating earnings* $ 1,652 $ 1,515 $ 1,379 Weighted average yen/dollar exchange rate 116.31 109.88 108.26 In Dollars In Yen Percentage change over previous year: 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Premium income .2 % 4.5 % 14.2 % 5.9 % 6.3 % 6.7 % Net investment income 3.2 5.0 9.6 9.0 7.0 2.3 Total operating revenues .6 4.7 13.4 6.3 6.6 6.0 Pretax operating earnings* 9.1 9.9 22.9 15.4 11.5 14.7 *See Page II 14 for our definition of segment operating earnings. The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of 5.4% in 2006 and 6.8% in both 2005 and 2004, reflect the high persistency of Aflac Japans business and the sales of new policies. Annualized premiums in force at December 31, 2006, were 1.08 trillion yen, compared with 1.03 trillion yen in 2005 and 961.9 billion yen in 2004. Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year end exchange rates, were $9.1 billion in 2006, $8.7 billion in 2005 and $9.2 billion in 2004. Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar denominated and reverse dual currency securities (yen denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). Dollar denominated investment income from these assets accounted for approximately 37% of Aflac Japans investment income in 2006, II 16 Table of Contents compared with 32% in 2005 and 30% in 2004. In years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating Aflac Japans dollar denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen weakens, translating dollar denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. On a constant currency basis, dollar denominated investment income accounted for approximately 36% of Aflac Japans investment income during 2006, compared with 32% in both 2005 and 2004. The following table illustrates the effect of translating Aflac Japans dollar denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year. Aflac Japan Percentage Changes Over Prior Year (Yen Operating Results) Including Foreign Excluding Foreign Currency Changes Currency Changes** 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Net investment income 9.0 % 7.0 % 2.3 % 6.8 % 6.3 % 4.5 % Total operating revenues 6.3 6.6 6.0 6.0 6.4 6.3 Pretax operating earnings* 15.4 11.5 14.7 13.3 10.8 15.3 *See Page II 14 for our definition of segment operating earnings. **Amounts excluding foreign currency changes on dollar denominated items were determined using the same yen/dollar exchange rate for the current year as each respective prior year. The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac Japan. Ratios to total revenues, in dollars: 2006 2005 2004 Benefits and claims 65.4 % 66.2 % 67.2 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 2.7 2.7 2.8 Insurance commissions 8.2 8.6 8.9 Insurance and other expenses 7.9 8.0 7.2 Total operating expenses 18.8 19.3 18.9 Pretax operating earnings* 15.8 14.5 13.9 *See Page II 14 for our definition of segment operating earnings. The benefit ratio has declined over the past several years, reflecting the impact of newer products with lower loss ratios. We have also experienced favorable claim trends in our major product lines. We expect the benefit ratio to continue to decline in future years primarily reflecting the shift to newer products and riders. However, this decline is partially offset by the effect of low investment yields, which impacts our profit margin by reducing the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves (see table and discussion on Page II 27). The operating expense ratio was higher in 2005 as a result of additional advertising expenditures and the write off of previously capitalized systems development costs. We expect the operating expense ratio to be relatively stable II 17 Table of Contents in 2007. Due to improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded to 15.8% in 2006. We expect continued expansion in the profit margin in 2007. Aflac Japan Sales Aflac Japans total new annualized premium sales declined 8.8% in 2006. The sales decline primarily reflected industry wide weakness in the market for stand alone medical insurance as well as continued declines in the sale of Rider MAX. The following table presents Aflac Japans total new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31. In Dollars In Yen (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Total new annualized premium sales $ 1,010 $ 1,167 $ 1,133 117.5 128.8 122.5 Percentage change over prior year (13.5 )% 3.0 % 8.2 % (8.8 )% 5.1 % 1.1 % Aflac Japans sales mix has been shifting during the last few years.

We expect this weakness will continue into 2007. However, with continued cost pressure on Japans health care system, we expect demand for medical products will continue to rise in the future and we remain encouraged about the outlook for the medical insurance market. Although that market is very competitive, Aflac Japan retains the distinction of being the number one seller of stand alone medical insurance in Japan. We believe that our number one position benefits us in the marketplace. As a result, we continue to believe that the medical category will be an important part of our product portfolio. The ordinary life category increased 16.9% in 2006, benefiting from the sale of WAYS, the innovative life insurance product we introduced in January 2006. Unlike traditional life insurance, WAYS allows a policyholder to convert a portion of the life insurance coverage to medical, nursing care, or fixed annuity benefits at retirement age. We remain very pleased with the initial response to WAYS, which accounted for approximately 8% of new sales in 2006. In June 2006, we began selling a new cancer plan aimed at existing cancer insurance policyholders. This new product provides additional benefits for inpatient and outpatient care. Our II 18 Table of Contents cancer life policies are also marketed by Dai ichi Mutual Life and in June 2006, Dai ichi Life began selling a new cancer product customized for their market. As a result, new sales from cancer insurance products were stable in 2006. We are convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio. We continue to expect 2007 to be a challenging year from a sales perspective and look for sales to again decline in the first half of the year, followed by modest sales increases in the second half of 2007. Aflac Japan Investments Growth of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations, timing of and yields on new investments, and the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on dollar denominated investment income. Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than Japanese government or other public corporate bonds would have provided, while still adhering to prudent standards for credit quality. All of our privately issued securities are rated investment grade at the time of purchase. These securities are generally issued with standard documentation for medium term note programs and have appropriate covenants. The following table presents the results of Aflac Japans investment activities for the years ended December 31. 2006 2005 2004 New money yield yen only 3.10 % 2.95 % 2.94 % New money yield blended 3.33 3.19 3.13 Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 4.11 4.14 4.26 At December 31, 2006, the yield on Aflac Japans investment portfolio, including dollar denominated investments, was 4.14%, compared with 4.22% a year ago. See Investments and Cash on Page II 28 for additional information. Japanese Economy Recent events indicate that Japans economy has begun to recover. The Bank of Japans January 2007 Monthly Report of Recent Economic & Financial Developments stated that Japans economy is expanding moderately, noting increases in exports and capital expenditures and moderate increases in household income, private consumption and housing investment, all against the backdrop of high corporate profits and expansion of overseas economies. The report did note a downward trend related to public investment and projected the trend to continue. However, it also included an expectation that the economy would continue to expand moderately, supported by expectations of increasing exports and domestic private demand. Nevertheless, the time required for a full economic recovery remains uncertain. II 19 Table of Contents Japans system of compulsory public health care insurance provides medical coverage to every Japanese citizen. These public medical expenditures are covered by a combination of premiums paid by insureds and their employers, taxes, and copayments from the people who receive medical service. However, given Japans aging population, the resources available to these publicly funded social insurance programs have come under increasing pressure. As a result, copayments and other out of pocket expenses have been rising and affecting more people. In 2003, copayments were raised from 20% to 30% for most consumers and other reforms were implemented in 2006. Additional reforms are being considered. We believe higher out of pocket expenses will lead more consumers to purchase supplemental insurance plans. Many insurance companies have recognized the opportunities for selling supplemental medical insurance in Japan and have launched new products in recent years. However, we believe our favorable cost structure compared with other insurers makes us a very effective competitor. In addition, we believe our brand, customer service, and financial strength also benefit our market position. Japanese Regulatory Environment The FSA adopted new mortality tables effective April 1, 2007, that will be used when developing our policy premium and reserving assumptions on newly underwritten policies. These new tables reflect recent improvements in survival rates in Japan. If our other assumptions remain unchanged, these revisions will generally lead to a decrease in policy premiums for death benefit products and an increase in premium rates for third sector products and annuities. Additionally, the FSA has implemented a new rule for third sector product reserving. The new reserving rule will be implemented in the Japanese fiscal year starting April 1, 2007. Under the new rule, we are required to conduct stress testing of our reserves using a prescribed method that incorporates actual incidence rates. The results of the tests and their relation to our reserves determine whether reserve strengthening is required. We do not anticipate that the new reserving requirements will have a material impact on our FSA based financial statements or our pricing. As disclosed in our third quarter 2006 Form 10 Q, Aflac Japan, along with the entire life insurance industry, began a review of the last five years of paid claims to determine if those claims were paid fully and accurately. In a recent notification from the FSA, the review process has been changed from a voluntary program to one that is mandatory and has been expanded to include a review of cash surrender value payments. Additionally, the FSA established a reporting deadline of April 13, 2007. We expect to complete our review of claims and cash surrender value payments and report our findings to the FSA within the time frame specified. As a result of this review, we have found some payment errors and we are correcting them. Additionally, we are using this review to identify process changes that will help ensure that payment errors such as these are not repeated. Although immaterial to our financial statements, we have recorded a liability for our estimate of the underpaid portion of those claims in our 2006 financial statements. II 20 Table of Contents AFLAC U.S. SEGMENT Aflac U.S. Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac U.S. pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac U.S. Aflac U.S. Summary of Operating Results (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Premium income $ 3,552 $ 3,245 $ 2,935 Net investment income 465 421 396 Other income 10 10 9 Total operating revenues 4,027 3,676 3,340 Benefits and claims 2,169 1,991 1,803 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 290 258 245 Insurance commissions 444 410 371 Insurance and other expenses 539 492 424 Total operating expenses 1,273 1,160 1,040 Total benefits and expenses 3,442 3,151 2,843 Pretax operating earnings* $ 585 $ 525 $ 497 Percentage change over previous year: Premium income 9.5 % 10.6 % 13.1 % Net investment income 10.4 6.5 9.4 Total operating revenues 9.5 10.0 12.6 Pretax operating earnings* 11.4 5.6 11.7 *See Page II 14 for our definition of segment operating earnings. The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force of 10.5% in 2006, 10.0% in 2005, and 10.9% in 2004 were favorably affected by increased sales at the worksite primarily through cafeteria plans and a slight improvement in the persistency of several products. Annualized premiums in force at December 31 were $4.1 billion in 2006, compared with $3.7 billion in 2005 and $3.4 billion in 2004. II 21 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac U.S. Ratios to total revenues: 2006 2005 2004 Benefits and claims 53.9 % 54.2 % 54.0 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 7.2 7.0 7.3 Insurance commissions 11.0 11.2 11.1 Insurance and other expenses 13.4 13.3 12.7 Total operating expenses 31.6 31.5 31.1 Pretax operating earnings* 14.5 14.3 14.9 *See Page II 14 for our definition of segment operating earnings. After several years of trending upward, the benefit ratio declined modestly in 2006. As a percentage of premium income, the benefit ratio was 61.0% in 2006, 61.3% in 2005, and 61.4% in 2004. We expect the benefit ratio to decline slightly in future periods due to favorable claim cost trends. The 2006 operating expense ratio reflects the write off of remaining deferred policy acquisition costs associated with a large payroll account that terminated in the first quarter. We expect the operating expense ratio, excluding discretionary promotional expenses, to remain relatively stable in future periods. The pretax operating profit margin is expected to increase slightly in 2007. Aflac U.S. Sales For 2006, total new annualized premium sales increased 13.1%, which exceeded our objective of 8% to 12% growth for the year. These record sales results were due, in part, to the re enrollment of a large payroll account. Our accident/disability and cancer expense products were again the primary contributors to sales. The following table presents Aflacs U.S. total new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Total new annualized premium sales $ 1,423 $ 1,259 $ 1,186 Increase over prior year 13.1 % 6.1 % 5.1 % Our objective for 2007 is to increase total new annualized premium sales by 6% to 10%.

During the third quarter of 2006, we launched revised specified health event and intensive care plans. In 2007 we will introduce an innovative care policy that provides benefits to help offset costs associated with caring for dependents as a result of their accident or illness. Another aspect of our growth strategy is our focus on growing and improving our U.S. sales force, and we were encouraged to see continued expansion in 2006. Although we did not set a specific recruiting target for 2006, we continued to emphasize recruiting as a means for growing our producer base. We recruited more than 26,000 new associates during 2006, which was 7.8% higher than 2005. At December 31, 2006, Aflac U.S. was represented by more than 68,300 licensed sales associates, which was 8.5% higher than a year ago. Our primary focus has been on increasing producing sales associates. We believe that we can achieve better producer growth through more effective and standardized training for our sales associates and sales management. On an average weekly basis, the number of producing associates rose 6.4% in 2006 to approximately 10,300, compared with a year ago. As previously disclosed, our focus has shifted from average monthly producers to average weekly producers as both a reporting and management metric. This shift provides for a more active management of our sales associates and allows our sales management to monitor progress and needs on a real time basis. Aflac U.S. Investments The following table presents the results of Aflacs U.S. investment activities. 2006 2005 2004 New money yield 6.44 % 6.16 % 6.30 % Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 6.86 6.54 6.68 At December 31, 2006, the portfolio yield on Aflacs U.S. portfolio was 7.15%, compared with 7.24% a year ago. See Investments and Cash on Page II 28 for additional information. OTHER OPERATIONS Corporate operating expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation, benefits, and facilities expenses. Corporate expenses, excluding investment income, were $57 million in 2006, $56 million in 2005, and $67 million in 2004. Investment income included in reported corporate expenses was $16 million in 2006, $14 million in 2005, and $5 million in 2004. Corporate expenses in 2004 were higher than normal primarily as a result of increased expenses associated with our retirement obligations. II 23 Table of Contents ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations during the last two years. The yen/dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen denominated balance sheet items to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The exchange rate at December 31, 2006, was 119.11 yen to one dollar, or .9% weaker than the December 31, 2005, exchange rate of 118.07. The weaker yen decreased reported investments and cash by $357 million; total assets by $400 million; and total liabilities by $392 million, compared with the amounts that would have been reported for 2006 if the exchange rate had remained unchanged from December 31, 2005. Market Risks of Financial Instruments Because we invest in fixed income securities, our financial instruments are exposed primarily to two types of market risks: currency risk and interest rate risk. Currency Risk The functional currency of Aflac Japans insurance operation is the Japanese yen. All of Aflac Japans premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as are most of its investment income and other expenses. Furthermore, most of Aflac Japans investments, cash and liabilities are yen denominated. When yen denominated securities mature or are sold, the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen denominated securities. Aflac Japan holds these yen denominated assets to fund its yen denominated policy obligations. In addition, Aflac Incorporated has yen denominated notes payable and cross currency swaps related to its dollar denominated senior notes. Although we generally do not convert yen into dollars, we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. On a consolidated basis, we attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders equity to foreign currency translation fluctuations. We accomplish this by investing a portion of Aflac Japans investment portfolio in dollar denominated securities, by the Parent Companys issuance of yen denominated debt and by the use of cross currency swaps (see Hedging Activities on Page II 35 for additional information). As a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is mitigated. The dollar values of our yen denominated net assets, which are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations for financial reporting purposes, are summarized as follows (translated at end of period exchange rates) for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2006 2005 Aflac Japan yen denominated net assets $ 2,317 $ 2,184 Parent Company yen denominated net liabilities (1,434 ) (1,403 ) Consolidated yen denominated net assets subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations $ 883 $ 781 II 24 Table of Contents The following table demonstrates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of our yen denominated assets and liabilities, and our consolidated yen denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of December 31.

This primarily occurs when we repatriate funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., which is done annually. The exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. These repatriations have not been greater than 80% of Aflac Japans prior year earnings determined in accordance with standards established by the FSA. A portion of the repatriation may be used to service Aflac Incorporateds yen denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars. II 25 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt securities. We use modified duration analysis, which measures price percentage volatility, to estimate the sensitivity of fair values to interest rate changes on debt securities we own. For example, if the current duration of a debt security is 10, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. Likewise, the fair value of the debt security will decrease by approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. The estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt securities we own, notes payable, cross currency swaps and our obligation for the Japanese policyholder protection fund as of December 31 follows: Sensitivity of Fair Values of Financial Instruments to Interest Rate Changes 2006 2005 +100 +100 Fair Basis Fair Basis (In millions) Value Points Value Points Debt securities: Fixed maturity securities: Yen denominated $ 32,328 $ 28,712 $ 29,791 $ 26,427 Dollar denominated 9,845 9,033 9,190 8,407 Perpetual debentures: Yen denominated 7,735 6,965 7,911 7,086 Dollar denominated 698 653 711 661 Total debt securities $ 50,606 $ 45,363 $ 47,603 $ 42,581 Notes payable* $ 1,421 $ 1,386 $ 1,395 $ 1,362 Cross currency and interest rate swap liabilities $ 7 $ 5 $ 12 $ 10 Japanese policyholder protection fund $ 175 $ 175 $ 203 $ 203 *Excludes capitalized lease obligations Changes in the interest rate environment have contributed to the unrealized gains on debt securities we own. However, we do not expect to realize a majority of these unrealized gains because we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Likewise, should significant amounts of unrealized losses occur because of increases in market yields, we would not expect to realize these losses because we have the intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity or recovery of value. For additional information on unrealized losses on debt securities, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. II 26 Table of Contents We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. The following table presents the approximate duration of our yen denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of December 31. (In years) 2006 2005 Yen denominated debt securities 13 12 Policy benefits and related expenses to be paid in future years 13 13 Premiums to be received in future years on policies in force 10 10 The following table shows a comparison of average required interest rates for future policy benefits and investment yields, based on amortized cost, for the years ended December 31. Comparison of Interest Rates for Future Policy Benefits and Investment Yields (Net of investment expenses) 2006 2005 2004 U.S. Japan* U.S. Japan* U.S. Japan* Policies issued during year: Required interest on policy reserves 5.50 % 2.77 % 5.50 % 2.88 % 6.36 % 2.97 % New money yield on investments 6.40 3.12 6.11 3.01 6.25 3.00 Policies in force during year: Required interest on policy reserves 6.28 4.71 6.36 4.79 6.40 4.87 Return on average invested assets 6.86 3.88 6.54 3.92 6.68 4.02 *Represents yen denominated investments for Aflac Japan that support policy obligations and therefore excludes Aflac Japans annuities, and dollar denominated investments and related investment income In response to low interest rates in the United States, we lowered our required interest assumption for newly issued products to 5.5% in 2005. In Japan, we lowered our required interest assumption for some newly issued products to 2.5% in 2005. However, the majority of Japans newly issued products have a required interest assumption of 3.0%. We continue to monitor the spread between our new money yield and the required interest assumption for newly issued products in both the United States and Japan and will re evaluate those assumptions as necessary. Over the next two years, we have yen denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of Aflac Japans current net investment yield of 3.88%. These securities total $1.1 billion at amortized cost and have an average yield of 5.80%. Currently, when debt securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. As a result, securities that mature may contribute to a decline in our overall portfolio yield. However, adding riders to our older policies has helped offset the negative investment spread. And despite negative investment spreads, adequate overall profit margins still exist in Aflac Japans aggregate block of business because of profits that have emerged from changes in mix of business and favorable experience from mortality, morbidity, and expenses. II 27 Table of Contents Investments and Cash Our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while emphasizing liquidity, safety and quality. Our investment objective, subject to appropriate risk constraints, is to fund policyholder obligations and other liabilities in a manner that enhances shareholders equity. We seek to achieve this objective through a diversified portfolio of fixed income investments that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities it supports. Aflac invests primarily within the debt securities markets. The following table details investment securities by segment as of December 31.

We have investments in both publicly issued and privately issued securities. However, the status of issuance should not be viewed as an indicator of liquidity or as a limitation on the determination of fair value. The outstanding amount(s) of a particular issuance, as well as the level of activity in a particular issuance and the state of the market, including credit events and the interest rate environment, affect liquidity regardless of type of issuance. We routinely assess the fair value of all of our investments. This process includes evaluating quotations provided by outside securities pricing sources and or compiled using data provided by external debt and equity market sources, as described more fully in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table details investment securities by type of issuance as of December 31.

Privately issued securities held by Aflac Japan at amortized cost accounted for $31.3 billion, or 64.0%, of total debt securities at December 31, 2006, and $27.9 billion, or 61.8%, of total debt securities at December 31, 2005. Reverse dual currency debt securities accounted for $9.7 billion, or 28.9%, of total privately issued securities at December 31, 2006, compared with $8.9 billion, or 29.6%, of total privately issued securities at December 31, 2005. Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than those available from Japanese government bonds. Aflac Japans investments in yen denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non Japanese issuers and have longer maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our asset/liability matching and our overall investment returns. Most of our privately issued securities are issued under medium term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and or event risk covenants are required. Our investment activities expose us to credit risk, which is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying investment positions. However, we continue to adhere to prudent standards for credit quality. We accomplish this by considering our product needs and overall corporate objectives, in addition to credit risk. Our investment policy requires that all securities be rated investment grade at the time of purchase. In evaluating the initial rating, we look at the overall senior issuer rating, the explicit rating for the actual issue or the rating for the security class, and, where applicable, the appropriate designation from the Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). All of our securities have ratings from either a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or the SVO of the NAIC. In addition, we perform extensive internal credit reviews to ensure that we are consistent in applying rating criteria for all of our securities. We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and II 29 Table of Contents internal credit analysis. The distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the years ended December 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows: Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating 2006 2005 2004 AAA 10.6 % 6.1 % 9.1 % AA 48.9 45.5 41.2 A 35.1 42.9 36.7 BBB 5.4 5.5 13.0 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The distributions of debt securities we own, by credit rating, were as follows: Composition by Credit Rating December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Cost Value Cost Value AAA 5.8 % 5.7 % 4.0 % 3.9 % AA 35.0 35.8 33.7 34.9 A 39.4 39.2 38.9 38.7 BBB 17.2 17.2 21.1 20.6 BB or lower 2.6 2.1 2.3 1.9 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The overall credit quality of our portfolio remained high in part because our investment policy prohibits us from purchasing below investment grade securities. In the event of a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade status, we do not automatically liquidate our position. However, if the security is in the held to maturity portfolio, we immediately transfer it to the available for sale portfolio so that the securitys fair value and its unrealized gain/loss are reflected on the balance sheet. Once we designate a security as below investment grade, we intensify our monitoring of the issuer. We do not automatically recognize an impairment if the securitys amortized cost exceeds its fair value. Our investment management starts by reviewing its credit analysis. Included in this process are an evaluation of the issuer, its current credit posture and an assessment of the future prospects for the issuer. We then obtain fair value information from at least three independent pricing sources. Upon determining the fair value, we move our focus to an analysis of whether or not the decline in fair value, if any, is other than temporary. For securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value, investment management then reviews the issue based on our impairment policy to determine if the investment should be impaired and or liquidated. The assessment of whether a decline is other than II 30 Table of Contents temporary requires significant management judgment and is discussed more fully in the Critical Accounting Estimates section on Page II 6.

This occurs when one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade. Our policy is to review each issue on a case by case basis to determine if a split rated security should be classified as investment grade or below investment grade. Our review includes evaluating the issuers credit position as well as current market pricing and other factors, such as the issuers or securitys inclusion on a credit rating downgrade watch list.

Declines in fair value noted above resulted from changes in interest rates, yen/dollar exchange rates, and issuer credit status. However, we believe that it would be inappropriate to recognize impairment charges because we believe the changes in fair value are temporary. Based on our evaluation and analysis of specific issuers in accordance with our impairment policy, impairment charges recognized in each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2006 were immaterial. II 33 Table of Contents Realized losses on debt securities were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2006: Realized Losses on Debt Securities Realized (In millions) Proceeds Loss Investment grade securities, length of consecutive unrealized loss: Less than six months $ 426 $ 15 Six months to 12 months 617 14 Over 12 months 37 1 Below investment grade securities, length of consecutive unrealized loss: Less than six months 37 3 Six months to 12 months 17 2 Total $ 1,134 $ 35 Realized losses on below investment grade securities primarily relate to the 2006 disposition of Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments totaled $1.2 billion, or 2.3% of total investments and cash, as of December 31, 2006, compared with $1.3 billion, or 2.6%, at December 31, 2005. For additional information concerning our investments, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred policy acquisition costs totaled $6.0 billion at December 31, 2006, an increase of $435 million, or 7.8% over 2005. The following table presents deferred policy acquisition costs by segment for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2006 2005 Aflac Japan $ 3,857 $ 3,624 Aflac U.S. 2,168 1,966 Aflac Japans deferred policy acquisition costs increased 6.4% (7.4% increase in yen). The weaker yen at year end decreased reported deferred policy acquisition costs by $34 million. Deferred policy acquisition costs of Aflac U.S. increased 10.3%. The increase in deferred policy acquisition costs was primarily driven by total new annualized premium sales. II 34 Table of Contents Policy Liabilities Policy liabilities totaled $45.4 billion at December 31, 2006, an increase of $3.1 billion, or 7.3% over 2005. The following table presents policy liabilities by segment for the years ending December 31. (In millions) 2006 2005 Aflac Japan $ 40,072 $ 37,556 Aflac U.S. 5,365 4,771 Aflac Japans policy liabilities increased 6.7% (7.6% increase in yen). The weaker yen at year end decreased reported policy liabilities by $353 million. Policy liabilities of Aflac U.S. increased 12.5%. The increase in total policy liabilities is the result of the growth and aging of our in force business. Notes Payable Notes payable totaled $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2006 and 2005. The ratio of debt to total capitalization (debt plus shareholders equity, excluding the unrealized gains and losses on investment securities) was 17.2% as of December 31, 2006, compared with 18.8% a year ago. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Benefit Plans Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan have various benefit plans. For additional information on our U.S. and Japanese plans, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Policyholder Protection Fund The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. In 2002, the members of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC) approved the Financial Services Agencys proposal, which increased the industrys obligation to the policyholder protection fund. In 2005, legislation was enacted extending the LIPPC framework, which included government fiscal measures supporting the LIPPC through March 2009. These new measures do not contemplate additional industry assessments through March 2009 absent an event requiring LIPPC funds. The likelihood and timing of future assessments, if any, cannot be determined at this time. Hedging Activities Aflac has limited hedging activities. Our primary exposure to be hedged is our investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. First, Aflac Japan owns dollar denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. Second, we have designated the Parent Companys yen denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes payable and cross currency swaps) as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the total of these II 35 Table of Contents yen denominated liabilities is equal to or less than our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective and the related exchange effect is reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. Should these yen denominated liabilities exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, the portion of the hedge that exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan would be deemed ineffective. As required by SFAS No. 133, we would then recognize the foreign exchange effect on the ineffective portion in net earnings (other income). We estimate that if the ineffective portion was 10 billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every one yen weakening/strengthening in the end of period yen/dollar exchange rate. At December 31, 2006, our hedge was effective with yen denominated assets exceeding yen denominated liabilities by 105.4 billion yen, compared with 92.3 billion yen at December 31, 2005. During the third quarter of 2006, we entered into interest rate swap agreements related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes. By entering into these contracts, we have been able to lock in our interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. Changes in the fair value of the swap contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income. The fair value of these swaps and related changes in fair value were immaterial during the year ended December 31, 2006. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, we had no material unconditional purchase obligations that were not recorded on the balance sheet. Additionally, we had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent Company through dividends and management fees. Aflac declared dividends to the Parent Company in the amount of $665 million in 2006, compared with $526 million in 2005 and $643 million in 2004. During 2006, Aflac paid $68 million to the Parent Company for management fees, compared with $73 million in 2005 and $33 million in 2004. The increase in management fees in 2005 resulted from a change in the allocation of expenses under the management fee agreement between Aflac and the Parent Company. The primary uses of cash by the Parent Company are shareholder dividends and our share repurchase program. The Parent Companys sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not expected to change materially in the future. The Parent Company also accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital. Capital is primarily used to fund business expansion and capital expenditures. In 2003, we filed a Shelf Registration Statement (SRS) with Japanese regulatory authorities to issue up to 100 billion yen of Samurai notes in Japan. In July 2005, we issued 40 billion yen (approximately $360 million) of these securities with a coupon of .71% and a five year maturity. These securities are not available to U.S. persons. The remaining 60 billion yen of the 2003 SRS expired in December 2005. As a result, II 36 Table of Contents we filed a new SRS with Japanese regulatory authorities in February 2006 to issue up to 100 billion yen (approximately $840 million using the December 31, 2006, exchange rate) of Samurai notes in Japan. If issued, these securities will not be available to U.S. persons. We also filed an SRS in August 2006 with Japanese regulatory authorities to issue up to 100 billion yen (approximately $840 million using the December 31, 2006, period end exchange rate) of Uridashi notes in Japan. In September 2006, the Parent Company issued 45 billion yen of yen denominated Uridashi notes from this SRS. If issued, the remaining 55 billion yen of yen denominated Uridashi notes will not be available to U.S. persons. We believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. For additional information, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income. The primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are policy claims, commissions, operating expenses, income taxes and payments to the Parent Company for management fees and dividends. Both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable. When making an investment decision, our first consideration is based on product needs. Our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment grade debt securities. These objectives also take into account duration matching, and because of the long term nature of our business, we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs. As a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. Therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. We expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses. The following table presents the estimated payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. We translated our yen denominated obligations using the December 31, 2006, exchange rate. Actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. Distribution of Payments by Period Less Total Total Than One to Four to After (In millions) Liability* Payments One Year Three Years Five Years Five Years Future policy benefits liability $ 40,841 $ 208,221 $ 6,403 $ 12,791 $ 12,496 $ 176,531 Unpaid policy claims liability 2,390 2,390 1,794 378 130 88 Long term debt principal 1,416 1,416 252 450 630 84 Long term debt interest 4 71 18 30 14 9 Policyholder protection fund 175 175 29 47 53 46 Operating service agreements N/A ** 530 47 128 121 234 Operating lease obligations N/A ** 143 42 36 19 46 Capitalized lease obligations 10 10 4 5 1 Total contractual obligations $ 44,836 $ 212,956 $ 8,589 $ 13,865 $ 13,464 $ 177,038 *Liability amounts are those reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. **Not applicable. II 37 Table of Contents The distribution of payments for future policy benefits is an estimate of all future benefit payments for policies in force as of December 31, 2006. These projected values contain assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality and morbidity. The distribution of payments for unpaid policy claims includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. Actual amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above. We anticipate that the future policy benefit liability of $40.8 billion at December 31, 2006, along with future net premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund future policy benefit payments. Consolidated Cash Flows We translate cash flows for Aflac Japans yen denominated items into U.S. dollars using weighted average exchange rates. In years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. The following table summarizes consolidated cash flows by activity for the years ended December 31. Consolidated Cash Flows by Activity (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Operating activities $ 4,397 $ 4,433 $ 4,486 Investing activities (4,057 ) (6,692 ) (1,418 ) Financing activities (434 ) (196 ) (313 ) Exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents (61 ) 6 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (94 ) $ (2,516 ) $ 2,761 Operating Activities Consolidated cash flow from operations was $4.4 billion in both 2006 and 2005, and $4.5 billion in 2004. The following table summarizes operating cash flows by source for the years ended December 31. Cash Provided by Operating Activities (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Aflac Japan $ 3,437 $ 3,691 $ 3,670 Aflac U.S. and Other Operations 960 742 816 The decrease in Aflac Japan cash flows was due primarily to an increase in income tax payments in 2006 as a result of realized gains related to our bond swap program. II 38 Table of Contents Investing Activities Operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase debt securities to meet future policy obligations. The following table summarizes investing cash flows by source for the years ended December 31. Cash Provided (Used) by Investing Activities (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Aflac Japan $ (3,372 ) $ (3,574 ) $ (3,692 ) Aflac U.S. and Other Operations (685 ) (3,118 ) 2,274 Cash flows for Aflac U.S. and Other Operations included the January 2005 return of cash collateral from the security lending activities of Aflac U.S. at the end of 2004 (approximately $2.6 billion). Prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. Currently, when debt securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, the long term nature of our business and our strong cash flows provide us with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. When market opportunities arise, we dispose of selected debt securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities and or improve future investment yields. As a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year. Dispositions before maturity were approximately 7% of the annual average investment portfolio of debt securities available for sale during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with 11% in 2005 and 5% in 2004. The increase of dispositions before maturity in 2006 and 2005 primarily resulted from the bond swaps we executed from the third quarter of 2005 through the second quarter of 2006. Financing Activities Consolidated cash used by financing activities was $434 million in 2006, $196 million in 2005 and $313 million in 2004. In September 2006, we received $382 million in connection with the Parent Companys issuance of yen denominated Uridashi notes. In June 2006, the Parent Company paid $355 million in connection with the maturity of the 2001 Samurai notes. In October 2005, we paid $261 million in connection with the maturity of the 2000 Samurai notes. In July 2005, the Parent Company received $360 million from its issuance of yen denominated Samurai notes. Cash provided by investment type contracts was $217 million in 2006, compared with $257 million in 2005 and $220 million in 2004. II 39 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of treasury stock activity during the years ended December 31.

The Nebraska insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net gain from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. These regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by Aflac to the Parent Company. A life insurance companys statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the NAIC, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance companys state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from GAAP and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. The continued long term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations. Aflacs insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings. The NAICs risk based capital (RBC) formula is used by insurance regulators to facilitate identification of inadequately capitalized insurance companies. The RBC formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurers operations. Aflacs RBC ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position. Currently, the NAIC has ongoing regulatory initiatives relating to revisions to the RBC II 40 Table of Contents formula as well as numerous initiatives covering insurance products, investments, and other actuarial and accounting matters. We believe that we will continue to maintain a strong RBC ratio and statutory capital and surplus position in future periods. In addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by U.S. insurance regulators, Japans FSA may not allow profit repatriations or other transfers from Aflac Japan if they would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders. The FSA maintains its own solvency standard. Aflac Japans solvency margin ratio significantly exceeds regulatory minimums. Payments are made from Aflac Japan to the Parent Company for management fees and to Aflac U.S. for allocated expenses and profit repatriations. During 2006, Aflac Japan paid $25 million to the Parent Company for management fees, compared with $28 million in 2005 and $24 million in 2004. Expenses allocated to Aflac Japan were $32 million in 2006, $30 million in 2005 and $26 million in 2004. During 2006, Aflac Japan repatriated profits of $442 million (50.0 billion yen) to Aflac U.S., compared with $374 million (41.2 billion yen) in 2005 and $220 million (23.9 billion yen) in 2004. Profits repatriated in 2004 were lower primarily as a result of realized investment losses recognized in 2003. For additional information on regulatory restrictions on dividends, profit repatriations and other transfers, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Rating Agencies Aflac is rated AA by both Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings and Aa2 (Excellent) by Moodys for financial strength. A.M. Best assigned Aflac an A+ (Superior) rating for financial strength and operating performance. Aflac Incorporateds senior debt, Samurai notes, and Uridashi notes are rated A by Standard & Poors, A+ by Fitch Ratings, and A2 by Moodys. Other In October 2006, the board of directors declared the first quarter 2007 cash dividend of $.185 per share. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2007. In 2004, the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 30 million shares of our common stock. In 2006, the board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional 30 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 37 million shares were available for purchase under our share repurchase programs.
