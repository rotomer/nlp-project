ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those informational statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements. We desire to take advantage of these provisions. This report contains cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected herein, and in any other statements made by Company officials in communications with the financial community and contained in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Forward looking statements are not based on historical information and relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Furthermore, forward looking information is subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements containing words such as expect, anticipate, believe, goal, objective, may, should, estimate, intends, projects, will, assumes, potential, target or similar words as well as specific projections of future results, generally qualify as forward looking. Aflac undertakes no obligation to update such forward looking statements. We caution readers that the following factors, in addition to other factors mentioned from time to time, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements: legislative and regulatory developments, including changes to health care and health insurance delivery assessments for insurance company insolvencies competitive conditions in the United States and Japan new product development and customer response to new products and new marketing initiatives ability to attract and retain qualified sales associates and employees ability to repatriate profits from Japan changes in U.S. and or Japanese tax laws or accounting requirements credit and other risks associated with Aflacs investment activities significant changes in investment yield rates fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates deviations in actual experience from pricing and reserving assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity, mortality, persistency, expenses and investment yields level and outcome of litigation downgrades in the Companys credit rating changes in rating agency policies or practices subsidiarys ability to pay dividends to the Parent Company ineffectiveness of hedging strategies catastrophic events general economic conditions in the United States and Japan, including increased uncertainty in the U.S. and international financial markets II 6 Table of Contents COMPANY OVERVIEW Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Companys insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of Aflac Incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three year period ended December 31, 2007. As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes. This MDA is divided into four primary sections. In the first section, we discuss our critical accounting estimates. We then follow with a discussion of the results of our operations on a consolidated basis and by segment. The third section presents an analysis of our financial condition as well as a discussion of market risks of financial instruments. We conclude by addressing the availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of Aflacs results of operations and financial condition are those related to investments, deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from managements analyses and judgments. The application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 94% of our assets and 84% of our liabilities are reported and thus have a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders equity. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results. Investments Aflacs investments in debt and equity securities include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For privately issued securities, we receive pricing data from external sources that take into account each securitys credit quality and liquidity characteristics. We also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. These reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 59, Accounting for Non Current Marketable Equity Securities; Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities; Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position 115 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments and related guidance. The identification of distressed investments, II 7 Table of Contents the determination of fair value if not publicly traded, and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require evaluation of factors, including but not limited to: percentage decline in value and the length of time during which the decline has occurred recoverability of principal and interest market conditions ability to hold the investment to maturity review of the issuers overall operating performance rating agency opinions and actions regarding the issuers credit standing adverse changes in the issuers availability of production resources, revenue sources and technological conditions adverse changes in the issuers economic, regulatory or political environment Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Policy Liabilities Aflacs products are generally long duration fixed benefit indemnity contracts. As such, those products are accounted for under the requirements of SFAS No. 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises. We make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business to match expected policy benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with expected policy premiums. These assumptions include persistency, morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses. If actual results match the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs, profits will emerge as a level percentage of earned premiums. However, because actual results will vary from the assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary from year to year. We measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business. Our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our DAC is recoverable. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Under the requirements of SFAS No. 60, certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policys premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income. Future amortization of DAC is based upon our estimates of persistency, interest and future premium revenue generally established at the time of policy issuance. However, the unamortized balance of DAC reflects actual persistency. As presented in the following table, the ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has been relatively stable for Aflac U.S. over the last three years. The ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has shown a slight upward trend for Aflac Japan for the last three years. This trend is a result of a greater proportion of our annualized premiums being under the alternative commission schedule, which pays a higher commission on first year premiums and lower commissions on renewal premiums. This schedule is very popular with our new agents as it helps them with cash flow for personal and business needs as they build their business. While this has resulted in a higher unamortized DAC balance, the overall cost to the company has been reduced.

Policy Liabilities (In millions) 2007 2006 U.S. segment: Future policy benefits $ 4,958 $ 4,391 Unpaid policy claims 856 816 Other policy liabilities 165 158 Total U.S. policy liabilities $ 5,979 $ 5,365 Japan segment: Future policy benefits $ 40,715 $ 36,447 Unpaid policy claims 1,599 1,574 Other policy liabilities 2,380 2,051 Total Japan policy liabilities $ 44,694 $ 40,072 Consolidated: Future policy benefits $ 45,675 $ 40,841 Unpaid policy claims 2,455 2,390 Other policy liabilities 2,546 2,209 Total consolidated policy liabilities $ 50,676 $ 45,440 Our policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with SFAS No. 60 and Actuarial Standards of Practice, include two primary components: future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 90% and 5% of total policy liabilities as of December 31, 2007, respectively. Future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. We calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. These assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued. The assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing II 9 Table of Contents the gross premiums for a policy. As required by GAAP, we also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience. Unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us. We compute unpaid policy claims on a non discounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. We update the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability. Our insurance products provide fixed benefit amounts per occurrence that are not subject to medical cost inflation. Furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the United States and Japan. This geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. Claims incurred under Aflacs policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. The unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. Severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. Our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders. As a part of our established financial reporting and accounting practices and controls, we perform actuarial reviews of our policyholder liabilities on an ongoing basis and reflect the results of those reviews in our results of operations and financial condition as required by GAAP. Our fourth quarter 2007 review indicated that we needed to strengthen the liability for two closed blocks of business, primarily due to better than expected persistency. In Japan, we strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $18 million for a closed block of dementia policies. In the United States, we strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $8 million for a closed block of small face amount life insurance coverage. Our 2006 analysis of recent cancer claims experience indicated that the overall duration of cancer outpatient treatments had lengthened. Because our reserving methods are designed to fully accrue each cancer outpatient treatment as of the date of initial treatment, we increased our estimate of the Aflac U.S. unpaid policy claims liability by $28 million in December 2006. This change in estimate was reflected in 2006 earnings. If we had been using the new claims factors to produce our claim liability estimates at the end of 2005, the increase for 2006 would have been $9 million. In 2006, our review also indicated that our policyholder liabilities were fairly stated in the aggregate; however, the components of policyholder liabilities (the unpaid policy claims liability and the future policy benefits liability) needed to be refined. As a result of our review, we took the actions described below. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we transferred $170 million of the Aflac U.S. unpaid policy claims liability to the future policy benefits liability for our accident/disability, short term disability, dental and specified health event lines of business. For the accident/disability line of business, a very small portion of the benefits in one of our policy forms required a future policy benefits liability to be accumulated. This amount was insignificant to our financial position in any year. However, to provide for this obligation, we approximated this liability II 10 Table of Contents amount as part of the unpaid policy claims liability. We determined that it was appropriate to modify our calculation method to determine the future policy benefits liability for that benefit separately from our unpaid policy claims liability and to move this liability of $25 million into the future policy benefits liability. For one of our short term disability policy forms, we determined that a selection factor assumption that should have applied to the future claim costs was not reflected in the calculation of the future policy benefits liability. We began using the calculation including the selection factor in the fourth quarter of 2006. We use a total liability approach to determine the unpaid policy claims liability for that line of business. For this reason, the underestimated amount of the future policy benefits liability, approximately $50 million, was accounted for in prior periods in the unpaid policy claims liability. As a result, we transferred $50 million from the unpaid policy claims liability into the future policy benefits liability for that line of business. For our dental and specified health event product lines, both of which are recently introduced product lines with limited actual claims experience, we refined the reserving methodology. For this reason, we had determined our policy liabilities for these two product lines using a total liability approach. This approach utilized expectations of claims costs and impact of underwriting based largely on the product pricing assumptions. As we developed experience on the dental and specified health event product lines, we modified our assumptions as to the impact of underwriting selection. Our experience has shown that the underwriting selection impact is greater than we had anticipated in our original pricing. In addition, for our dental plan, we also modified our assumption of the impact of various benefit waiting periods for that plan to reflect the larger than anticipated impact of the waiting periods. Both of these changes in assumptions resulted in 2006 claims being lower than anticipated in the original pricing assumptions for these two products. Thus, our unpaid claims liability was lower than we originally estimated. However, our analysis also showed that the future claim cost curve would be steeper than we originally anticipated. Thus, we expected more future claims than we previously estimated and increased our liability for future policy benefits accordingly. For this reason, in the fourth quarter of 2006, we modified our methodology to use a combination of claim cost expectations and claim completion factors to calculate the unpaid policy claims liability for these two product lines. As a result, the modification in methodology resulted in a transfer from the unpaid policy claims liability of approximately $95 million to the future policy benefits liability. Also during the fourth quarter of 2006, we transferred $85 million from Aflac Japans unpaid policy claims liability to its future policy benefits liability. This transfer primarily related to a continued decline in current period claims caused by changes to health care delivery in Japan and had no effect on net earnings. Our 2006 claims review indicated that we have experienced a continued decline in the average number of in hospital days associated with cancer treatment periods in Japan. We believe the average number of days per hospital visit declined primarily due to changes in financial incentives provided to hospitals by the government sponsored health care system in Japan to shorten the average hospital stay. However, our claims statistics also indicated that the declines in the average number of days per hospitalization have generally been offset by an increase in the frequency of future hospitalizations associated with the treatment of cancer. As a result, we reflected the increased number of future hospitalizations per claimant in our future policy benefit liability. More hospitalizations per claimant will result in a larger amount of expected future claims and an increase in our liability for future policy benefits. Meanwhile, we are paying less for current period claims, and therefore have a smaller unpaid claims liability. II 11 Table of Contents In computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. We monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. Claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. In calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, we do not calculate a range of estimates. The following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of December 31, 2007, to changes in severity and frequency of claims. For the years 2005 through 2007, and before the effect of the fourth quarter 2006 adjustments noted above, our assumptions changed on average by approximately 1% in total, and we believe that a variation in assumptions in a range of plus or minus 1% in total is reasonably likely to occur. Sensitivity of Unpaid Policy Claims Liability (In millions) Total Severity Decrease Decrease Increase Increase Total Frequency by 2% by 1% Unchanged by 1% by 2% Increase by 2% $ $ 16 $ 32 $ 49 $ 66 Increase by 1% (16 ) 16 33 49 Unchanged (32 ) (16 ) 16 32 Decrease by 1% (48 ) (32 ) (16 ) 16 Decrease by 2% (63 ) (48 ) (32 ) (16 ) The growth of the future policy benefits liability is the result of the aging of our in force block of business and the addition of new business. In addition, the growth in 2006 was moderately impacted by the previously discussed transfer of $170 million at Aflac U.S. and $85 million at Aflac Japan from the unpaid policy claims liability to the future policy benefits liability. These two transfers accounted for less than 1% of the increase in the aggregate. The table below reflects the growth of future policy benefits liability for the years ended December 31. Future Policy Benefits (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2007 2006 2005 Aflac U.S. $ 4,958 $ 4,391 $ 3,780 Growth rate 12.9 % 16.2 % 12.7 % Aflac Japan $ 40,715 $ 36,447 $ 34,071 Growth rate 11.7 % 7.0 % (5.4 )% Consolidated $ 45,675 $ 40,841 $ 37,853 Growth rate 11.8 % 7.9 % (3.8 )% Yen/dollar exchange rate (end of period) 114.15 119.11 118.07 Aflac Japan (in yen) 4,648 4,341 4,023 Growth rate 7.1 % 7.9 % 7.2 % II 12 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements During the last three years, various accounting standard setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. For information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table is a presentation of items impacting net earnings and net earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31. Items Impacting Net Earnings In Millions Per Diluted Share 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Net earnings $ 1,634 $ 1,483 $ 1,483 $ 3.31 $ 2.95 $ 2.92 Items impacting net earnings, net of tax: Realized investment gains (losses) 19 51 167 .04 .10 .33 Impact from SFAS 133 2 (10 ) (.02 ) Release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 34 .07 Realized Investment Gains and Losses Our investment strategy is to invest in investment grade fixed income securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the Companys profitability. We do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and or general portfolio maintenance and rebalancing. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the principal drivers of our profitability. In 2007, we realized pretax gains of $28 million (after tax, $19 million, or $.04 per diluted share) primarily as a result of securities sold or redeemed in the normal course of business. In 2006, we realized pretax gains of $79 million (after tax, $51 million, or $.10 per diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps and the liquidation of equity securities held by Aflac U.S. In 2005, we realized pretax gains of $262 million (after tax, $167 million, or $.33 per diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps. We began our bond swap program in the second half of 2005 and concluded it in the first half of 2006. These bond swaps took advantage of tax loss carryforwards and also resulted in an improvement in overall portfolio credit quality and investment income. Impact from SFAS 133 We entered into cross currency swap agreements to effectively convert our dollar denominated senior notes, which mature in 2009, into a yen denominated obligation (see Notes 4 and 7 of the II 13 Table of Contents Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The effect of issuing fixed rate, dollar denominated debt and swapping it into fixed rate, yen denominated debt has the same economic impact on Aflac as if we had issued yen denominated debt of a like amount. However, the accounting treatment for cross currency swaps is different from issuing yen denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133), requires that the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of the cross currency swaps, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, be reflected in net earnings. This change in fair value is determined by relative dollar and yen interest rates and has no cash impact on our results of operations. At maturity, the fair value will equal initial contract fair value, and the cumulative impact of gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the interest component will be zero. We have the ability and intent to retain the cross currency swaps until their maturity. The impact from SFAS 133 includes the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross currency swaps, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, and is included in other income. We have also issued yen denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes. We have designated these notes as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the value of these yen denominated notes and the notional amounts of the cross currency swaps exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, we would be required to recognize the foreign currency effect on the excess, or ineffective portion, in net earnings. The ineffective portion would be included in the impact from SFAS 133. These hedges were effective during the three year period ended December 31, 2007; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes and have designated the swap agreements as a hedge of the variability of the debt cash flows. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. SFAS 133 requires that the change in the fair value of the swap contracts be recorded in other comprehensive income so long as the hedge is deemed effective. Any ineffectiveness would be recognized in net earnings (other income) and would be included in the impact from SFAS 133. These hedges were effective during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings. See Notes 1, 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Nonrecurring Items We received regulatory approval for a change in the allocation of expenses under the management fee agreement between Aflac and the Parent Company in 2005. This enabled the Parent Company to fully utilize its tax basis, non life operating losses and therefore release the valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax assets, resulting in a benefit of $34 million ($.07 per diluted share) in 2005. The tax benefit was included as a reduction to income tax expense in the 2005 consolidated statements of earnings. Foreign Currency Translation Aflac Japans premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen denominated assets to support yen denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. We translate Aflac Japans yen denominated II 14 Table of Contents income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its yen denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our Company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, management evaluates Aflacs financial performance, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Income Taxes Our combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was 34.6% in 2007, 34.5% in 2006, and 33.4% in 2005. Total income taxes were $865 million in 2007, compared with $781 million in 2006 and $743 million in 2005. Japanese income taxes on Aflac Japans results account for most of our consolidated income tax expense. Our 2005 income tax rate was lower than normal primarily as a result of the release of the valuation allowance for non life losses discussed previously. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Earnings Guidance We communicate earnings guidance in this report based on the growth in net earnings per diluted share. However, certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of managements control may have a significant impact on actual results. Therefore, our comparison of net earnings includes certain assumptions to reflect the limitations that are inherent in projections of net earnings. In comparing year over year results, we exclude the effect of realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133 and nonrecurring items. We also assume no impact from foreign currency translation on the Aflac Japan segment and the Parent Companys yen denominated interest expense for a given year in relation to the prior year. Subject to the preceding assumptions, our objective for 2007 was to increase net earnings per diluted share by 15% to 16% over 2006. We reported 2007 net earnings per diluted share of $3.31. Adjusting that number for realized investment gains ($.04 per diluted share), the impact from SFAS 133 (nil per diluted share) and foreign currency translation (a loss of $.02 per diluted share), we met our objective for the year. Our objective for 2008 is to increase net earnings per diluted share by 13% to 15% over 2007, on the basis described above. If we achieve this objective, the following table shows the likely results for 2008 net earnings per diluted share, including the impact of foreign currency translation using various yen/dollar exchange rate scenarios.

GAAP financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual financial statements. Furthermore, we are required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets. We measure and evaluate our insurance segments financial performance using operating earnings on a pretax basis. We define segment operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. We believe that an analysis of segment pretax operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is conducted in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars. We evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales. Total new annualized premium sales, which include new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, represent the premiums that we would collect over a 12 month period, assuming the policies remain in force. For Aflac Japan, total new annualized premium sales are determined by applications written during the reporting period. For Aflac U.S., total new annualized premium sales are determined by applications that are accepted during the reporting period. Premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period. II 16 Table of Contents AFLAC JAPAN SEGMENT Aflac Japan Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac Japans pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan Summary of Operating Results (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Premium income $ 9,037 $ 8,762 $ 8,745 Net investment income: Yen denominated investment income 1,102 1,064 1,111 Dollar denominated investment income 699 624 524 Net investment income 1,801 1,688 1,635 Other income 27 25 31 Total operating revenues 10,865 10,475 10,411 Benefits and claims 6,935 6,847 6,898 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 318 285 284 Insurance commissions 850 859 892 Insurance and other expenses 941 832 822 Total operating expenses 2,109 1,976 1,998 Total benefits and expenses 9,044 8,823 8,896 Pretax operating earnings* $ 1,821 $ 1,652 $ 1,515 Weighted average yen/dollar exchange rate 117.93 116.31 109.88 In Dollars In Yen Percentage change over previous year: 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Premium income 3.1 % .2 % 4.5 % 4.3 % 5.9 % 6.3 % Net investment income 6.7 3.2 5.0 8.0 9.0 7.0 Total operating revenues 3.7 .6 4.7 4.9 6.3 6.6 Pretax operating earnings* 10.2 9.1 9.9 11.8 15.4 11.5 *See the Insurance Operations section of this MDA for our definition of segment operating earnings. The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of 3.9% in 2007, 5.4% in 2006 and 6.8% in 2005, reflect the high persistency of Aflac Japans business and the sales of new policies. Annualized premiums in force at December 31, 2007, were 1.13 trillion yen, compared with 1.08 trillion yen in 2006 and 1.03 trillion yen in 2005. Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year end exchange rates, were $9.9 billion in 2007, $9.1 billion in 2006, and $8.7 billion in 2005. Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar denominated and reverse dual currency securities (yen denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). Dollar denominated investment income from these assets accounted for approximately 39% of Aflac Japans investment income in 2007, compared with 37% in 2006 and 32% in 2005. In years when the yen strengthens in relation to the II 17 Table of Contents dollar, translating Aflac Japans dollar denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen weakens, translating dollar denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. On a constant currency basis, dollar denominated investment income accounted for approximately 39% of Aflac Japans investment income during 2007, compared with 36% in 2006 and 32% in 2005. The following table illustrates the effect of translating Aflac Japans dollar denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year. Aflac Japan Percentage Changes Over Prior Year (Yen Operating Results) Including Foreign Excluding Foreign Currency Changes Currency Changes** 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Net investment income 8.0 % 9.0 % 7.0 % 7.4 % 6.8 % 6.3 % Total operating revenues 4.9 6.3 6.6 4.9 6.0 6.4 Pretax operating earnings* 11.8 15.4 11.5 11.3 13.3 10.8 *See the Insurance Operations section of this MDA for our definition of segment operating earnings. **Amounts excluding foreign currency changes on dollar denominated items were determined using the same yen/dollar exchange rate for the current year as each respective prior year. The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac Japan. Ratios to total revenues in dollars: 2007 2006 2005 Benefits and claims 63.8 % 65.4 % 66.2 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 2.9 2.7 2.7 Insurance commissions 7.8 8.2 8.6 Insurance and other expenses 8.7 7.9 8.0 Total operating expenses 19.4 18.8 19.3 Pretax operating earnings* 16.8 15.8 14.5 *See the Insurance Operations section of this MDA for our definition of segment operating earnings. The benefit ratio has declined over the past several years, reflecting the impact of newer products and riders with lower loss ratios. We have also experienced favorable claim trends in our major product lines. We expect the improvement in the benefit ratio to continue as we shift to newer products and riders and benefit from the impact of favorable claim trends. However, this improvement is partially offset by the effect of low investment yields, which impacts our profit margin by reducing the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves (see table and discussion in the Interest Rate Risk section of this MDA). We expect the operating expense ratio to increase modestly in 2008. Due to improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded to 16.8% in 2007. We expect continued expansion in the profit margin in 2008. II 18 Table of Contents Aflac Japan Sales As discussed last year, we expected sales to decline in the first half of 2007 and to be flat to up 4% in the second half. Consistent with our expectations, Aflac Japans total new annualized premium sales in yen declined 6.9% in the first six months of 2007 but increased 2.5% in the last six months of 2007, resulting in an overall decrease of 2.4% for the full year, compared with 2006. The sales decline primarily reflected industrywide weakness in the market for stand alone medical insurance as well as continued declines in the sales of Rider MAX and ordinary life products. The following table presents Aflac Japans total new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31. In Dollars In Yen (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Total new annualized premium sales $ 974 $ 1,010 $ 1,167 114.6 117.5 128.8 Percentage change over prior year (3.5 ) % (13.5 ) % 3.0 % (2.4 ) % (8.8 ) % 5.1 % The following table details the contributions to total new annualized premium sales by major product for the years ended December 31. 2007 2006 2005 Medical policies 33 % 33 % 37 % Cancer life 33 28 26 Ordinary life 22 23 18 Rider MAX 7 10 11 Other 5 6 8 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Cancer insurance was our top selling product category for Aflac Japan in 2007 with sales rising 12.9% over 2006. We expect cancer insurance sales to remain strong in part because of the successful introduction of Cancer Forte, which is the first major revision we have made to our cancer product category in six years. With Cancer Forte, we increased outpatient benefits. In addition to our traditional first occurrence benefit, this product also pays an annuity to a newly diagnosed patient from the second year through the fifth year following diagnosis. It also assists policyholders with counseling and doctor referral services through a third party upon diagnosis of the disease. Our cancer life policies are also marketed by Dai ichi Mutual Life and in June 2006, Dai ichi Life began selling a new cancer product customized for their market. In 2007, Dai ichi Life sold nearly 244,000 of our market leading cancer life policies, enabling Dai ichi Life to retain its distinction as the number two seller of cancer insurance behind only Aflac Japan. We are convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio. Medical sales decreased 3.8% in 2007. However, as the year progressed, medical sales improved, primarily resulting from the success of Gentle EVER, our new nonstandard medical product that was introduced in August 2007. With continued cost pressure on Japans health care system, we expect the need for medical products will continue to rise in the future and we remain encouraged II 19 Table of Contents about the outlook for the medical insurance market. Although the market is very competitive, Aflac Japan remained the number one seller of stand alone medical insurance in Japan in 2007. We believe that our number one position benefits us in the marketplace. As a result, we continue to believe that the medical category will be an important part of our product portfolio. We believe that there is still a strong need for our products in Japan. Our objective is to increase sales 3% to 7% in 2008, including contributions from our new distribution channels which we expect to gradually increase throughout the year (see the Japanese Regulatory Environment section of this MDA for further discussion regarding these distribution channels). Aflac Japan Investments Growth of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations, timing of and yields on new investments, and the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on dollar denominated investment income. Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than Japanese government or other public corporate bonds would have provided, while still adhering to prudent standards for credit quality. All of our privately issued securities are rated investment grade at the time of purchase. These securities are generally issued with standard documentation for medium term note programs and have appropriate covenants. The following table presents the results of Aflac Japans investment activities for the years ended December 31. 2007 2006 2005 New money yield yen only 3.05 % 3.10 % 2.95 % New money yield blended 3.38 3.33 3.19 Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 4.06 4.11 4.14 At December 31, 2007, the yield on Aflac Japans investment portfolio, including dollar denominated investments, was 4.02%, compared with 4.14% a year ago. See the Investments and Cash section of this MDA for additional information. Japanese Economy The Bank of Japans January 2008 Monthly Report of Recent Economic Financial Developments stated that Japans economy is expanding moderately. Private consumption has been steady, while household income has increased moderately. Business investment in plant and equipment has continued to trend upward against the background of high corporate profits. However, mainly due to the drop in housing investment, the pace of growth for Japans economy has been slowing. Housing investment is expected to recover gradually, and business investment in plant and equipment and private consumption are likely to increase due to high corporate profits and the moderate rise in household income. However, public investment is projected to be on a downtrend. The report projected that Japans economy is expected to continue expanding moderately, however at a slow pace. We believe that although the Japanese economy has been growing in recent years, the ability to sustain such expansion remains uncertain. II 20 Table of Contents Japans system of compulsory public health care insurance provides medical coverage to every Japanese citizen. These public medical expenditures are covered by a combination of premiums paid by insureds and their employers, taxes and copayments from the people who receive medical service. However, given Japans aging population, the resources available to these publicly funded social insurance programs have come under increasing pressure. As a result, copayments and other out of pocket expenses have been rising and affecting more people. We believe higher out of pocket expenses will lead consumers to purchase more supplemental medical insurance. Many insurance companies have recognized the opportunities for selling supplemental medical insurance in Japan and have launched new products in recent years. However, we believe our favorable cost structure compared with other insurers makes us a very effective competitor. In addition, we believe our brand, customer service and financial strength also benefit our market position. Japanese Regulatory Environment Japans Financial Services Agency (FSA) adopted new mortality tables for reserving newly underwritten policies effective April 2007. These new tables reflect recent improvements in survival rates in Japan and have generally resulted in a decrease in policy premiums for death benefit products and an increase in premium rates for third sector (health) products and annuities. We reflected the impact of the new mortality table in our product pricing for the first sector (life) products effective April 2007. For the third sector, the revised tables were reflected in our product pricing effective September 2007. Additionally, the FSA has implemented a new rule for third sector product reserving. The new reserving rule was effective April 1, 2007. Under the new rule, we are required to conduct stress testing of our reserves using a prescribed method that incorporates actual morbidity. The results of the tests and their relation to our reserves determine whether reserve strengthening is required. This new reserve requirement will not impact our GAAP financial statements, and we currently estimate that adoption of this requirement will not have a material impact on our 2007 FSA based financial statements or on our product pricing. At the end of 2006, Aflac Japan, along with the entire life insurance industry, began a review of the last five years of paid claims to determine if those claims were paid fully and accurately. In April 2007, Aflac Japan reported the findings of its review to the FSA. In October 2007, the insurance industry updated its data for underpaid claims. The updated data for the industry included an increase in the number of cases and yen amount of underpayment compared to the data that was first reported in April, primarily a result of a type of underpayment where companies did not notify policyholders of their potential eligibility for additional benefit payments, which the policyholders did not claim in their original claim filings. Our initial estimate for that type of underpayment was fairly accurate and the number of cases was very small. In the fourth quarter we reported 26,700 cases of delayed interest payments on cash surrender values, which on average was 75 yen per case (approximately $.66 per case using the December 31, 2007, period end exchange rate). In total for the five year period, we reported 1.9 billion yen (approximately $16.8 million using the December 31, 2007, period end exchange rate) of underpaid claims in April, and we revised the amount to 2.1 billion yen (approximately $18.4 million using the December 31, 2007, period end exchange rate) in October. We are using this review to identify process changes that will help ensure that payment errors such as these are not repeated. The financial impact of paying the claims that were in error was immaterial to our operations and has been provided for in our 2007 and 2006 financial statements as applicable. II 21 Table of Contents We expect that our distribution system will continue to evolve in Japan. Regulatory changes that took effect in December 2007 enable banks to sell our products to their customers. We believe that it will take time for momentum to build in the bank channel for selling third sector products. However, our strong brand as the leading seller of cancer and medical insurance products in Japan and our extensive, long standing relationships with more than 60% of Japans banks place us in a strong position to sell through this new channel. By the end of January 2008, we had agreements with 41 banks to market Aflacs products through more than 3,300 branches nationwide. In October 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japans postal system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. The privatization laws split Japan Post into four entities that began operating in October 2007. The four entities are Japan Post Service Co., Ltd.; Japan Post Network Co., Ltd.; Japan Post Bank Co., Ltd.; and Japan Post Insurance Co., Ltd. In November 2007, Japan Post Network Co. selected Aflac Japan as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through Japans vast post office network. Japan Post Network Co. operates the 24,000 post offices located throughout Japan, providing a significant opportunity for us to reach new consumers. II 22 Table of Contents AFLAC U.S. SEGMENT Aflac U.S. Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac U.S. pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac U.S. Aflac U.S. Summary of Operating Results (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Premium income $ 3,936 $ 3,552 $ 3,245 Net investment income 500 465 421 Other income 10 10 10 Total operating revenues 4,446 4,027 3,676 Benefits and claims 2,350 2,169 1,991 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 323 290 258 Insurance commissions 481 444 410 Insurance and other expenses 600 539 492 Total operating expenses 1,404 1,273 1,160 Total benefits and expenses 3,754 3,442 3,151 Pretax operating earnings* $ 692 $ 585 $ 525 Percentage change over previous year: Premium income 10.8 % 9.5 % 10.6 % Net investment income 7.5 10.4 6.5 Total operating revenues 10.4 9.5 10.0 Pretax operating earnings* 18.3 11.4 5.6 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MDA for our definition of segment operating earnings. The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force of 10.0% in 2007, 10.5% in 2006, and 10.0% in 2005 were favorably affected by increased sales at the worksite primarily through cafeteria plans and a slight improvement in the persistency of several products. Annualized premiums in force at December 31 were $4.5 billion in 2007, compared with $4.1 billion in 2006 and $3.7 billion in 2005. Net investment income is expected to be flat for 2008 compared with 2007 due to the transfer of approximately $450 million to the Parent Company from Aflac U.S. to support the expected increase in share repurchases in 2008. II 23 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac U.S. Ratios to total revenues: 2007 2006 2005 Benefits and claims 52.9 % 53.9 % 54.2 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 7.3 7.2 7.0 Insurance commissions 10.8 11.0 11.2 Insurance and other expenses 13.4 13.4 13.3 Total operating expenses 31.5 31.6 31.5 Pretax operating earnings* 15.6 14.5 14.3 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MDA for our definition of segment operating earnings. After several years of trending upward, the benefit ratio declined in 2007 and 2006, primarily reflecting favorable claim cost trends on our major product lines. We expect the benefit ratio, operating expense ratio, and pretax operating profit margin to remain relatively stable in 2008. Aflac U.S. Sales For 2007, total new annualized premium sales increased 9.5%, which was at the upper end of our objective of 6% to 10% growth for the year. An administrative change in the timing of agents production credit for delay bill policy conversions accelerated approximately $8 million of conversion premiums from the first quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding the impact of the change in conversion processing, total new annualized premium sales were up 8.9% for 2007. The following table presents Aflacs U.S. total new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Total new annualized premium sales $ 1,558 $ 1,423 $ 1,259 Increase over prior year 9.5 % 13.1 % 6.1 % Our objective for 2008 is to increase total new annualized premium sales by 8% to 12%. The following table details the contributions to total new annualized premium sales by major product category for the years ended December 31. 2007 2006 2005 Accident/disability coverage 51 % 52 % 51 % Cancer expense insurance 18 17 19 Hospital indemnity products 14 12 11 Fixed benefit dental coverage 6 6 8 Other 11 13 11 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Total new annualized premium sales for accident/disability, our leading product category, increased 7.1% in 2007, while cancer expense insurance increased 11.1% and our hospital indemnity category increased 19.9%, compared with 2006. II 24 Table of Contents One aspect of our growth strategy is the continued enhancement of our product line. In August 2007, Aflac U.S. introduced a new cancer product, Maximum Difference. This new cancer indemnity plan incorporates coverage for medical advances in cancer prevention, diagnostics, treatment and the many new ways cancer patients may now receive their care. Maximum Difference allows customization of coverage to fit varying needs and budgets. Another aspect of our growth strategy is our focus on growing and improving our U.S. sales force, and we were encouraged to see continued expansion in 2007. We recruited more than 24,200 new sales associates in 2007, resulting in more than 71,200 licensed sales associates at December 31, 2007, a 4.2% increase compared with 2006. Over the last two years, our primary focus has been on increasing the number of average weekly producers, which measures producers who make solid, consistent contributions to sales. On a weekly basis, the average number of U.S. associates actively producing business rose 6.0% to more than 10,900 in 2007. Our focus on average weekly producers as both a reporting and management metric provides for a more active management of our sales associates and allows our sales management to monitor progress and needs on a real time basis. Aflac U.S. Investments The following table presents the results of Aflacs U.S. investment activities. 2007 2006 2005 New money yield 6.44 % 6.44 % 6.16 % Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 6.79 6.86 6.54 At December 31, 2007, the portfolio yield on Aflacs U.S. portfolio was 7.00%, compared with 7.15% a year ago. See the Investments and Cash section of this MDA for additional information. OTHER OPERATIONS Corporate operating expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation, benefits and facilities expenses. Corporate expenses, excluding investment income, were $56 million in 2007, $57 million in 2006, and $56 million in 2005. Investment income included in reported corporate expenses was $31 million in 2007, $16 million in 2006, and $14 million in 2005. II 25 Table of Contents ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations during the last two years. The yen/dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen denominated balance sheet items to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The exchange rate at December 31, 2007, was 114.15 yen to one dollar, or 4.3% stronger than the December 31, 2006, exchange rate of 119.11. The stronger yen increased reported investments and cash by $1.9 billion, total assets by $2.1 billion, and total liabilities by $2.1 billion, compared with the amounts that would have been reported for 2007 if the exchange rate had remained unchanged from December 31, 2006. Market Risks of Financial Instruments Because we invest in fixed income securities, our financial instruments are exposed primarily to two types of market risks: currency risk and interest rate risk. Currency Risk The functional currency of Aflac Japans insurance operation is the Japanese yen. All of Aflac Japans premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as are most of its investment income and other expenses. Furthermore, most of Aflac Japans investments, cash and liabilities are yen denominated. When yen denominated securities mature or are sold, the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen denominated securities. Aflac Japan holds these yen denominated assets to fund its yen denominated policy obligations. In addition, Aflac Incorporated has yen denominated notes payable and cross currency swaps related to its dollar denominated senior notes. Although we generally do not convert yen into dollars, we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in other comprehensive income. On a consolidated basis, we attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders equity to foreign currency translation fluctuations. We accomplish this by investing a portion of Aflac Japans investment portfolio in dollar denominated securities, by the Parent Companys issuance of yen denominated debt and by the use of cross currency swaps (see the Hedging Activities section of this MDA for additional information). As a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is mitigated. The dollar values of our yen denominated net assets, which are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations for financial reporting purposes, are summarized as follows (translated at end of period exchange rates) for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2007 2006 Aflac Japan yen denominated net assets $ 2,415 $ 2,317 Parent Company yen denominated net liabilities (1,496 ) (1,434 ) Consolidated yen denominated net assets subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations $ 919 $ 883 II 26 Table of Contents The following table demonstrates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of our yen denominated assets and liabilities, and our consolidated yen denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of December 31.

This primarily occurs when we repatriate funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., which is done annually. The exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. These repatriations have not been greater than 80% of Aflac Japans prior year earnings determined in accordance with standards established by the FSA. A portion of the repatriation may be used to service Aflac Incorporateds yen denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars. II 27 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt securities. We use modified duration analysis, which measures price percentage volatility, to estimate the sensitivity of fair values to interest rate changes on debt securities we own. For example, if the current duration of a debt security is 10, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. Likewise, the fair value of the debt security will decrease by approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. The estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt securities we own, notes payable, cross currency swaps and our obligation to the Japanese policyholder protection corporation as of December 31 follows: Sensitivity of Fair Values of Financial Instruments to Interest Rate Changes 2007 2006 +100 +100 Fair Basis Fair Basis (In millions) Value Points Value Points Debt securities: Fixed maturity securities: Yen denominated $ 36,314 $ 32,151 $ 32,328 $ 28,712 Dollar denominated 10,388 9,505 9,845 9,033 Perpetual debentures: Yen denominated 7,598 6,889 7,735 6,965 Dollar denominated 431 395 698 653 Total debt securities $ 54,731 $ 48,940 $ 50,606 $ 45,363 Notes payable* $ 1,452 $ 1,415 $ 1,421 $ 1,386 Cross currency and interest rate swap liabilities $ 35 $ 27 $ 7 $ 5 Japanese policyholder protection corporation $ 151 $ 151 $ 175 $ 175 * Excludes capitalized lease obligations Changes in the interest rate environment impact the fair value of our debt securities and, as a result, directly affect the balance of unrealized gains or losses for a given period in relation to a prior period. Decreases in market yields generate unrealized gains and increases in market yields generate unrealized losses. However, we would not expect to realize a majority of those unrealized gains or losses because we have the intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity or recovery of value. For additional information on unrealized losses on debt securities, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. II 28 Table of Contents We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. The following table presents the approximate duration of our yen denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of December 31. (In years) 2007 2006 Yen denominated debt securities 13 13 Policy benefits and related expenses to be paid in future years 14 13 Premiums to be received in future years on policies in force 10 10 The following table shows a comparison of average required interest rates for future policy benefits and investment yields, based on amortized cost, for the years ended December 31. Comparison of Interest Rates for Future Policy Benefits and Investment Yields (Net of Investment Expenses) 2007 2006 2005 U.S. Japan* U.S. Japan* U.S. Japan* Policies issued during year: Required interest on policy reserves 5.50 % 2.74 % 5.50 % 2.77 % 5.50 % 2.88 % New money yield on investments 6.40 3.11 6.40 3.12 6.11 3.01 Policies in force during year: Required interest on policy reserves 6.20 4.63 6.28 4.71 6.36 4.79 Return on average invested assets 6.79 3.83 6.86 3.88 6.54 3.92 * Represents yen denominated investments for Aflac Japan that support policy obligations and therefore excludes Aflac Japans annuities, and dollar denominated investments and related investment income In response to low interest rates in the United States, we lowered our required interest assumption for newly issued products to 5.5% in 2005. In Japan, we lowered our required interest assumption for some newly issued products to 2.5% in 2005. However, the majority of Japans newly issued products have a required interest assumption of 3.0%. We continue to monitor the spread between our new money yield and the required interest assumption for newly issued products in both the United States and Japan and will re evaluate those assumptions as necessary. Over the next two years, we have yen denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of Aflac Japans current net investment yield of 3.83%. These securities total $1.9 billion at amortized cost and have an average yield of 5.70%. Currently, when our debt securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. As a result, securities that mature may contribute to a decline in our overall portfolio yield. However, adding riders to our older policies has helped offset the negative investment spread. Despite negative investment spreads, adequate overall profit margins still exist in Aflac Japans aggregate block of business because of profits that have emerged from changes in the mix of business and favorable experience from mortality, morbidity and expenses. II 29 Table of Contents Investments and Cash Our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while emphasizing liquidity, safety and quality. Our investment objective, subject to appropriate risk constraints, is to fund policyholder obligations and other liabilities in a manner that enhances shareholders equity. We seek to achieve this objective through a diversified portfolio of fixed income investments that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities it supports. Aflac invests primarily within the debt securities markets. The following table details investment securities by segment as of December 31. Investment Securities by Segment Aflac Japan Aflac U.S. (In millions) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Securities available for sale, at fair value: Fixed maturities $ 23,532 $ 22,044 $ 6,874 * $ 6,659 * Perpetual debentures 3,764 3,935 331 473 Equity securities 22 25 Total available for sale 27,318 26,004 7,205 7,132 Securities held to maturity, at amortized cost: Fixed maturities 16,799 13,464 20 19 Perpetual debentures 3,985 3,990 Total held to maturity 20,784 17,454 20 19 Total investment securities $ 48,102 $ 43,458 $ 7,225 $ 7,151 * Excludes investment grade, available for sale fixed maturity securities held by the Parent Company of $105 in 2007 and $102 in 2006. We have investments in both publicly and privately issued securities. However, the status of issuance should not be viewed as an indicator of liquidity or as a limitation on the determination of fair value. The outstanding amount of a particular issuance, as well as the level of activity in a particular issuance and market conditions, including credit events and the interest rate environment, affect liquidity regardless of type of issuance. We routinely assess the fair value of all of our investments. This process includes evaluating quotations provided by outside securities pricing sources and or compiled using data provided by external debt and equity market sources, as described more fully in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table details investment securities by type of issuance as of December 31. II 30 Table of Contents Investment Securities by Type of Issuance 2007 2006 Amortized Fair Amortized Fair (In millions) Cost Value Cost Value Publicly issued securities: Fixed maturities $ 15,986 $ 16,919 $ 15,092 $ 16,269 Perpetual debentures 173 157 173 176 Equity securities 13 19 13 22 Total publicly issued 16,172 17,095 15,278 16,467 Privately issued securities: Fixed maturities 30,232 29,783 25,490 25,905 Perpetual debentures 8,084 7,872 8,158 8,256 Equity securities 3 3 3 3 Total privately issued 38,319 37,658 33,651 34,164 Total investment securities $ 54,491 $ 54,753 $ 48,929 $ 50,631 Privately issued securities accounted for 70.3% of total debt securities, at amortized cost, at December 31, 2007, compared with 68.8% at December 31, 2006. Privately issued securities held by Aflac Japan at amortized cost accounted for $36.0 billion, or 66.0%, of total debt securities at December 31, 2007, compared with $31.3 billion, or 64.0%, of total debt securities at December 31, 2006. Reverse dual currency debt securities accounted for $11.1 billion, or 29.2%, of total privately issued securities at December 31, 2007, compared with $9.7 billion, or 28.9%, of total privately issued securities at December 31, 2006. Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than those available from Japanese government bonds. Aflac Japans investments in yen denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non Japanese issuers and have longer maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our asset/liability matching and our overall investment returns. Most of our privately issued securities are issued under medium term note programs and have standard documentation, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and or event risk covenants are required. Our investment activities expose us to credit risk, which is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying investment positions. However, we continue to adhere to prudent standards for credit quality. We accomplish this by considering our product needs and overall corporate objectives, in addition to credit risk. In evaluating the initial rating, we look at the overall senior issuer rating, the explicit rating for the actual issue or the rating for the security class, and, where applicable, the appropriate designation from the Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). All of our securities have ratings from either a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or the SVO of the NAIC. In addition, we perform extensive internal credit reviews to ensure that we are consistent in applying rating criteria for all of our securities. In light of recent market activity surrounding the subprime lending market, we have performed a review of our investment portfolio. We have no direct investment exposure to the subprime lending market and have not identified any material indirect exposure to that market. We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and II 31 Table of Contents internal credit analysis. The distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the years ended December 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows: Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating 2007 2006 2005 AAA 18.4 % 10.6 % 6.1 % AA 44.1 48.9 45.5 A 30.2 35.1 42.9 BBB 7.3 5.4 5.5 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The increase in securities purchased in the AAA rated category is primarily due to the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills by Aflac Japan prior to repatriating profits to Aflac U.S. in the third quarter of 2007. The distributions of debt securities we own, by credit rating, were as follows: Composition by Credit Rating December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Cost Value Cost Value AAA 6.3 % 6.2 % 5.8 % 5.7 % AA 44.3 45.3 35.0 35.8 A 30.7 30.4 39.4 39.2 BBB 16.8 16.6 17.2 17.2 BB or lower 1.9 1.5 2.6 2.1 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The increase in AAA and AA rated holdings compared with December 31, 2006, resulted from purchases and credit rating upgrades by rating agencies; the offset was a corresponding decrease in the A rated holdings. The decline in BB or lower rated securities resulted from the upgrade of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines from below investment grade to investment grade during the second quarter of 2007. In the event of a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade status, we do not automatically liquidate our position. However, if the security is in the held to maturity portfolio, we immediately transfer it to the available for sale portfolio so that the securitys fair value and its unrealized gain or loss are reflected on the balance sheet. Once we designate a security as below investment grade, we intensify our monitoring of the issuer. We do not automatically recognize an impairment if the securitys amortized cost exceeds its fair value. Our investment management starts by reviewing its credit analysis. Included in this process are an evaluation of the issuer, its current credit and liquidity posture, its operations and an assessment of the future prospects for the issuer. We then obtain fair value information from at least three independent pricing sources. Upon determining the fair value, we move our focus to an analysis of whether the decline in fair value, if any, is other than temporary. For securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value, investment management then reviews the issue based on our impairment policy to determine if the investment should be impaired and or liquidated. The assessment of II 32 Table of Contents whether a decline is other than temporary requires significant management judgment and is discussed more fully in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MDA. Securities classified as below investment grade as of December 31 were as follows: Below Investment Grade Securities 2007 2006 Par Amortized Fair Par Amortized Fair (In millions) Value Cost Value Value Cost Value Ahold $ 310 $ 311 $ 272 $ 299 $ 300 $ 245 Ford Motor Credit 263 263 215 252 252 229 KLM Royal Dutch Airlines * * * 252 252 229 CSAV 210 210 143 201 201 145 BAWAG 123 123 90 118 118 103 Ford Motor Company 111 122 93 111 122 100 Tennessee Gas Pipeline * * * 31 30 35 International Securities Trading Corp. 20 * * * Patrick Family Housing (Patrick AFB) 4 1 1 * * * Aloha Utilities Inc. 2 2 1 * * * Total $ 1,043 $ 1,032 $ 815 $ 1,264 $ 1,275 $ 1,086 * Investment grade at respective reporting date Occasionally a debt security will be split rated. This occurs when one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade. Our policy is to review each issue on a case by case basis to determine if a split rated security should be classified as investment grade or below investment grade. Our review includes evaluating the issuers credit position as well as current market pricing and other factors, such as the issuers or securitys inclusion on a credit rating downgrade watch list. Split rated securities as of December 31, 2007, represented .7% of total debt securities at amortized cost and were as follows: Split Rated Securities Amortized Moodys SP Fitch Investment Grade (In millions) Cost Rating Rating Rating Status Signum (Ahold) $ 280 Baa3 BB+ BB+ Below Investment Grade Tennessee Gas Pipeline 31 Baa3 BB BBB Investment Grade Union Carbide Corp. 15 Ba2 BBB BBB Investment Grade Ahold Finance USA Inc. 15 Baa3 BB+ BB+ Below Investment Grade Oncor Electric Delivery 11 Ba1 BBB BBB Investment Grade Bell Canada 9 Baa1 BB+ BB Investment Grade II 33 Table of Contents The following table provides details on amortized cost, fair value and unrealized gains and losses for our investments in debt securities by investment grade status as of December 31, 2007.

Declines in fair value noted above resulted from changes in interest rates, yen/dollar exchange rates, and issuer credit status, as well as increasing risk premiums. However, we believe that it would be inappropriate to recognize impairment charges because we believe the changes in fair value are temporary. Based on our evaluation and analysis of specific issuers in accordance with our impairment policy, impairment charges recognized in 2007 were $23 million, before taxes. Impairment charges in 2006 and 2005 were immaterial. Realized losses on debt securities, as a result of sales and impairment charges, were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2007: Realized Losses on Debt Securities Realized (In millions) Proceeds Loss Investment grade securities, length of consecutive unrealized loss: Less than six months $ 163 $ 1 Six months to 12 months 52 3 Over 12 months 60 2 Below investment grade securities, length of consecutive unrealized loss: Less than six months 20 Over 12 months 2 Total $ 275 $ 28 Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.6 billion, or 2.7% of total investments and cash, as of December 31, 2007, compared with $1.2 billion, or 2.3%, at December 31, 2006. For additional information concerning our investments, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. II 35 Table of Contents Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs The following table presents deferred policy acquisition costs by segment for the years ended December 31.

The stronger yen at year end increased reported deferred policy acquisition costs by $178 million. Deferred policy acquisition costs of Aflac U.S. increased 10.0%. The increase in deferred policy acquisition costs was primarily driven by total new annualized premium sales. Policy Liabilities The following table presents policy liabilities by segment for the years ending December 31. (In millions) 2007 2006 Aflac Japan $ 44,694 $ 40,072 Aflac U.S. 5,979 5,365 Other business segments 3 3 Total $ 50,676 $ 45,440 Increase over prior year 11.5 % 7.3 % Aflac Japans policy liabilities increased 11.5% (6.9% increase in yen). The stronger yen at year end increased reported policy liabilities by $1.9 billion. Policy liabilities of Aflac U.S. increased 11.4%. The increase in total policy liabilities is the result of the growth and aging of our in force business. Notes Payable Notes payable totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.4 billion at December 31, 2006. The ratio of debt to total capitalization (debt plus shareholders equity, excluding the unrealized gains and losses on investment securities) was 15.6% as of December 31, 2007, compared with 17.2% a year ago. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Benefit Plans Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan have various benefit plans. For additional information on our U.S. and Japanese plans, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. II 36 Table of Contents Policyholder Protection Corporation The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. In 2005, legislation was enacted extending the framework of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC), which included government fiscal measures supporting the LIPPC through March 2009. These measures do not contemplate additional industry assessments through March 2009 absent an event requiring LIPPC funds. The likelihood and timing of future assessments, if any, cannot be determined at this time. Hedging Activities Aflac has limited hedging activities. Our primary exposure to be hedged is our investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. First, Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. Second, we have designated the Parent Companys yen denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes payable and cross currency swaps) as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the total of these yen denominated liabilities is equal to or less than our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective and the related exchange effect is reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. Should these yen denominated liabilities exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, the portion of the hedge that exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan would be deemed ineffective. As required by SFAS No. 133, we would then recognize the foreign exchange effect on the ineffective portion in net earnings (other income). We estimate that if the ineffective portion was 10 billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every one yen weakening/strengthening in the end of period yen/dollar exchange rate. At December 31, 2007, our hedge was effective with yen denominated assets exceeding yen denominated liabilities by 105.2 billion yen, compared with 105.4 billion yen at December 31, 2006. We have interest rate swap agreements related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes. By entering into these contracts, we have been able to lock in our interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. Changes in the fair value of the swap contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income. The fair value of these swaps and related changes in fair value were immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2007, we had no material unconditional purchase obligations that were not recorded on the balance sheet. Additionally, we had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. II 37 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent Company through dividends and management fees. Aflac paid dividends to the Parent Company in the amount of $1.4 billion in 2007, compared with $665 million in 2006 and $526 million in 2005. During 2007, Aflac paid $80 million to the Parent Company for management fees, compared with $68 million in 2006 and $73 million in 2005. The primary uses of cash by the Parent Company are shareholder dividends and our share repurchase program. The Parent Companys sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable. For additional information, see the Financing Activities section of this MDA. The Parent Company also accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital. Capital is primarily used to fund business expansion and capital expenditures. We have a Shelf Registration Statement (SRS) on file with Japanese regulatory authorities to issue up to 100 billion yen of yen denominated Samurai notes in Japan. In June 2007, the Parent Company issued 30 billion yen of yen denominated Samurai notes from this SRS. If issued, the remaining 70 billion yen (approximately $613 million using the December 31, 2007, period end exchange rate) of yen denominated Samurai notes will not be available to U.S. persons. We also have an SRS on file with Japanese regulatory authorities to issue up to 100 billion yen of Uridashi notes in Japan. In September 2006, the Parent Company issued 45 billion yen of yen denominated Uridashi notes from this SRS. If issued, the remaining 55 billion yen (approximately $482 million using the December 31, 2007, period end exchange rate) of yen denominated Uridashi notes will not be available to U.S. persons. We believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. For additional information, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income. The primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are policy claims, commissions, operating expenses, income taxes and payments to the Parent Company for management fees and dividends. Both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable. When making an investment decision, our first consideration is based on product needs. Our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment grade debt securities. These objectives also take into account duration matching; and, because of the long term nature of our business, we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs. As a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. Therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. We expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses. II 38 Table of Contents The following table presents the estimated payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007. We translated our yen denominated obligations using the December 31, 2007, exchange rate. Actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. Distribution of Payments by Period Less Total Total Than One to Four to After (In millions) Liability* Payments One Year Three Years Five Years Five Years Future policy benefits liability $ 45,675 $ 229,269 $ 7,014 $ 13,949 $ 13,412 $ 194,894 Unpaid policy claims liability 2,455 2,455 1,866 363 128 98 Long term debt principal 1,457 1,457 800 569 88 Long term debt interest 5 72 22 29 14 7 Policyholder protection corporation 151 151 23 51 59 18 Operating service agreements N/A ** 606 96 178 149 183 Operating lease obligations N/A ** 145 46 35 21 43 Capitalized lease obligations 8 8 3 4 1 Total contractual obligations $ 49,751 $ 234,163 $ 9,070 $ 15,409 $ 14,353 $ 195,331 * Liability amounts are those reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. ** Not applicable Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $34 million have been excluded from the tabular disclosure above because the timing of cash payment is not reasonably estimable. The distribution of payments for future policy benefits is an estimate of all future benefit payments for policies in force as of December 31, 2007. These projected values contain assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality and morbidity. The distribution of payments for unpaid policy claims includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. Actual amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above. We anticipate that the future policy benefit liability of $45.7 billion at December 31, 2007, along with future net premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund future policy benefit payments. Consolidated Cash Flows We translate cash flows for Aflac Japans yen denominated items into U.S. dollars using weighted average exchange rates. In years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. The following table summarizes consolidated cash flows by activity for the years ended December 31. Consolidated Cash Flows by Activity (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Operating activities $ 4,656 $ 4,397 $ 4,433 Investing activities (3,654 ) (4,057 ) (6,692 ) Financing activities (655 ) (434 ) (196 ) Exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents 13 (61 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 360 $ (94 ) $ (2,516 ) II 39 Table of Contents Operating Activities The following table summarizes operating cash flows by source for the years ended December 31. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Aflac Japan $ 3,573 $ 3,437 $ 3,691 Aflac U.S. and other operations 1,083 960 742 Total $ 4,656 $ 4,397 $ 4,433 We expect cash provided by operating activities in the future to decline as a result of increased U.S. federal tax payments. U.S. cash tax payments are expected to increase in 2008 because we fully utilized our remaining tax credit carryforwards. Future cash provided by operating activities will also be reduced by the payout of lump sum benefits to policyholders on a closed block of business. The majority of these benefit payouts will begin in 2008 and will conclude in 2012. We anticipate paying out approximately $450 million over the five year period. Investing Activities Operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase debt securities to meet future policy obligations. The following table summarizes investing cash flows by source for the years ended December 31. Net Cash Used by Investing Activities (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Aflac Japan $ (3,231 ) $ (3,372 ) $ (3,574 ) Aflac U.S. and other operations (423 ) (685 ) (3,118 ) Total $ (3,654 ) $ (4,057 ) $ (6,692 ) Cash used by investing activities for Aflac U.S. and other operations in 2005 included the January 2005 return of cash collateral from the security lending activities of Aflac U.S. at the end of 2004 (approximately $2.6 billion). Prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. Currently, when our debt securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, the long term nature of our business and our strong cash flows provide us with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. When market opportunities arise, we dispose of selected debt securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and or rebalance our portfolio. As a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year. Dispositions before maturity were approximately 4% of the annual average investment portfolio of debt securities available for sale during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with 7% in 2006 and 11% in 2005. Dispositions before maturity in 2006 and 2005 were impacted by the bond swaps we executed from the third quarter of 2005 through the second quarter of 2006. II 40 Table of Contents Financing Activities Consolidated cash used by financing activities was $655 million in 2007, $434 million in 2006 and $196 million in 2005. In June 2007, we received $242 million in connection with the Parent Companys issuance of yen denominated Samurai notes, and we paid $242 million in connection with the maturity of the 2002 Samurai notes. In June 2006, the Parent Company paid $355 million in connection with the maturity of the 2001 Samurai notes. In September 2006, the Parent Company received $382 million from its issuance of yen denominated Uridashi notes. In October 2005, we paid $261 million in connection with the maturity of the 2000 Samurai notes. In July 2005, the Parent Company received $360 million from its issuance of yen denominated Samurai notes. Cash returned to shareholders through treasury stock purchases and dividends was $979 million in 2007, compared with $728 million in 2006 and $647 million in 2005.

Under the agreement, we purchased 12.5 million shares of our outstanding common stock at $60.58 per share for a total purchase price of $757 million. The repurchase was funded with internal capital. The shares were acquired as a part of previously announced share repurchase authorizations by our board of directors and will be held in treasury. Under the agreement, Merrill Lynch plans to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market from time to time until it has acquired a number of shares equivalent to the number of shares we purchased from Merrill Lynch. At the end of this period, we may receive, or may be required to remit, a purchase price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the ASR program period. Under the terms of the ASR we may elect to receive or pay any settlement amount in cash or shares of our common stock at our option. The completion and settlement of the ASR program is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2008, although the settlement may occur before the second quarter at Merrill Lynchs option.

The Nebraska insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net gain from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. These regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by Aflac to the Parent Company. A life insurance companys statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the NAIC, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance companys state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from GAAP and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. The continued long term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations. Aflacs insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings. The NAICs risk based capital (RBC) formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. The RBC formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurers operations. Aflacs RBC ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position. Currently, the NAIC has ongoing regulatory initiatives relating to revisions to the RBC formula as well as numerous initiatives covering insurance products, investments, and other actuarial and accounting matters. We believe that we will continue to maintain a strong RBC ratio and statutory capital and surplus position in future periods. In addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by U.S. insurance regulators, Japans FSA may not allow profit repatriations or other transfers from Aflac Japan if they would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders. The FSA maintains its own solvency standard. Aflac Japans solvency margin ratio significantly exceeds regulatory minimums. Payments are made from Aflac Japan to the Parent Company for management fees and to Aflac U.S. for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings. During 2007, Aflac Japan paid $32 million to the Parent Company for management fees, compared with $25 million in 2006 and $28 million in 2005. Expenses allocated to Aflac Japan were $33 million in 2007, $32 million in 2006 and $30 million in II 42 Table of Contents 2005. During 2007, Aflac Japan remitted profits of $567 million (67.8 billion yen) to Aflac U.S., compared with $442 million (50.0 billion yen) in 2006 and $374 million (41.2 billion yen) in 2005.
