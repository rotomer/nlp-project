Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those informational statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements. We desire to take advantage of these provisions. This report contains cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected herein, and in any other statements made by Company officials in communications with the financial community and contained in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Forward looking statements are not based on historical information and relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Furthermore, forward looking information is subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements containing words such as expect, anticipate, believe, goal, objective, may, should, estimate, intends, projects, will, assumes, potential, target or similar words as well as specific projections of future results, generally qualify as forward looking. Aflac undertakes no obligation to update such forward looking statements. We caution readers that the following factors, in addition to other factors mentioned from time to time, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements: difficult condition in global capital markets and the economy generally governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets defaults and downgrades in certain securities in our investment portfolio impairment of financial institutions credit and other risks associated with Aflacs investment in hybrid securities differing judgments applied to investment valuations subjective determinations of amount of impairments taken on our investments realization of unrealized losses limited availability of acceptable yen denominated investments concentration of our investments in any particular sector concentration of business in Japan ongoing changes in our industry exposure to significant financial and capital markets risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates significant changes in investment yield rates deviations in actual experience from pricing and reserving assumptions subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to the Parent Company changes in regulation by governmental authorities ability to attract and retain qualified sales associates and employees ability to continue to develop and implement improvements in information technology systems changes in U.S. and or Japanese accounting standards decreases in our financial strength or debt ratings level and outcome of litigation ability to effectively manage key executive succession catastrophic events failure of internal controls or corporate governance policies and procedures 41 Table of Contents COMPANY OVERVIEW Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Companys insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business. MDA OVERVIEW Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of Aflac Incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three year period ended December 31, 2008. As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes. This MDA is divided into the following sections: Critical accounting estimates Results of operations, consolidated and by segment Analysis of financial condition, including discussion of market risks of financial instruments Capital Resources and Liquidity, including discussion of availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of Aflacs results of operations and financial condition are those related to investments, deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from managements analyses and judgments. The application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 96% of our assets and 86% of our liabilities are reported as of December 31, 2008, and thus has a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders equity. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results. Investments Aflacs investments in debt securities, perpetual securities and equity securities include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For privately issued securities, we receive pricing data from external sources that take into account each securitys credit quality and liquidity characteristics. We also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. These reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The identification of distressed investments, the determination of fair value if not publicly traded, and the assessment of 42 Table of Contents whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require evaluation of factors, including but not limited to: percentage decline in value and the length of time during which the decline has occurred recoverability of principal and interest market conditions our ability to hold the investment to maturity review of the issuers overall operating performance and financial condition rating agency opinions and actions regarding the issuers credit standing adverse changes in the issuers availability of production resources, revenue sources and technological conditions adverse changes in the issuers economic, industry, regulatory or political environment See Notes 1, 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Policy Liabilities Aflacs products are generally long duration fixed benefit indemnity contracts. We make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business to match expected policy benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with expected policy premiums. These assumptions include persistency, morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses. If actual results match the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs, profits will emerge as a level percentage of earned premiums. However, because actual results will vary from the assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary from year to year. We measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business. Our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our DAC is recoverable. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policys premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income. Future amortization of DAC is based upon our estimates of persistency, interest and future premium revenue generally established at the time of policy issuance. However, the unamortized balance of DAC reflects actual persistency. As presented in the following table, the ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force increased slightly for Aflac U.S. in 2008, compared with the prior two years, as a result of the introduction of an accelerated commission payment option for new associates and the refinement of our first year commission deferrals on certain products. The ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has shown a slight upward trend for Aflac Japan for the last three years. This trend is a result of a greater proportion of our annualized premiums being under the alternative commission schedule, which pays a higher commission on first year premiums and lower commissions on renewal premiums. This schedule is very popular with our new agents as it helps them with cash flow for personal and business needs as they build their business. While this has resulted in a higher unamortized DAC balance, the overall cost to the company has been reduced. 43 Table of Contents Deferred Policy Acquisition Cost Ratios Aflac Japan Aflac U.S. (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Deferred policy acquisition costs $ 5,644 $ 4,269 $ 3,857 $ 2,593 $ 2,385 $ 2,168 Annualized premiums in force 12,761 9,860 9,094 4,789 4,510 4,101 Deferred policy acquisition costs as a percentage of annualized premiums in force 44.2 % 43.3 % 42.4 % 54.1 % 52.9 % 52.9 % Policy Liabilities The following table provides details of policy liabilities by segment and in total as of December 31. Policy Liabilities (In millions) 2008 2007 U.S. segment: Future policy benefits $ 5,442 $ 4,958 Unpaid policy claims 933 856 Other policy liabilities 375 165 Total U.S. policy liabilities $ 6,750 $ 5,979 Japan segment: Future policy benefits $ 53,866 $ 40,715 Unpaid policy claims 2,184 1,599 Other policy liabilities 3,416 2,380 Total Japan policy liabilities $ 59,466 $ 44,694 Consolidated: Future policy benefits $ 59,310 $ 45,675 Unpaid policy claims 3,118 2,455 Other policy liabilities 3,791 2,546 Total consolidated policy liabilities $ 66,219 $ 50,676 Our policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with applicable guidelines as defined under GAAP and Actuarial Standards of Practice, include two primary components: future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 90% and 5% of total policy liabilities as of December 31, 2008, respectively. Future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. We calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. These assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued. The assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. As required by GAAP, we also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience. Unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been 44 Table of Contents reported to us. We compute unpaid policy claims on a non discounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. We update the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability. Our insurance products provide fixed benefit amounts per occurrence that are not subject to medical cost inflation. Furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the United States and Japan. This geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. Claims incurred under Aflacs policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. The unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. Severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. Our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders. As a part of our established financial reporting and accounting practices and controls, we perform actuarial reviews of our policyholder liabilities on an ongoing basis and reflect the results of those reviews in our results of operations and financial condition as required by GAAP. Our fourth quarter 2007 review indicated that we needed to strengthen the liability for two closed blocks of business, primarily due to better than expected persistency. In Japan, we strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $18 million for a closed block of dementia policies. In the United States, we strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $8 million for a closed block of small face amount life insurance coverage. In 2007, our unpaid policy claims liability for prior years declined by approximately $400 million. More than 70% of the release of our unpaid policy claims liability resulted from incurred but not reported claims that are estimated using a claim cost and completion factor method. During the first 12 months after a claim is incurred, we estimate the ultimate cost of the claim based on initial expected claim cost factors that reflect our experience in prior periods. In the 13th month after incurral, we change the estimating basis to a completion factor method because the actual cash payments to date for claims 13 or more months old are deemed to have sufficient credibility on which to base the remaining liability estimate. Prior to the 13th month, the historical claim cost method is deemed to have more credibility. The difference in estimate between the two methods is routinely recognized in our financial statements in the 13th month after a claim is incurred. For the past several years, we have experienced a downward trend in our current period hospitalization claim costs, primarily in Japan. For this reason, our claim cost estimate as of December 31, 2006, was high. Redundancy or insufficiency is initially recognized when the claims reach the thirteenth month after incurral. More than 75% of the 2007 release of prior period claim liability was related to claims incurred in 2006. The remainder was related to claims incurred prior to 2006. In computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. We monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. Claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. In calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, we do not 45 Table of Contents calculate a range of estimates. The following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of December 31, 2008, to changes in severity and frequency of claims. For the years 2006 through 2008, our assumptions changed on average by approximately 1% in total, and we believe that a variation in assumptions in a range of plus or minus 1% in total is reasonably likely to occur. Sensitivity of Unpaid Policy Claims Liability (In millions) Total Severity Decrease Decrease Increase Increase Total Frequency by 2% by 1% Unchanged by 1% by 2% Increase by 2% $ $ 19 $ 39 $ 59 $ 79 Increase by 1% (19 ) 20 39 59 Unchanged (38 ) (19 ) 20 39 Decrease by 1% (57 ) (38 ) (19 ) 19 Decrease by 2% (76 ) (57 ) (38 ) (19 ) The table below reflects the growth of future policy benefits liability for the years ended December 31. Future Policy Benefits (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2008 2007 2006 Aflac U.S. $ 5,442 $ 4,958 $ 4,391 Growth rate 9.8 % 12.9 % 16.2 % Aflac Japan $ 53,866 $ 40,715 $ 36,447 Growth rate 32.3 % 11.7 % 7.0 % Consolidated $ 59,310 $ 45,675 $ 40,841 Growth rate 29.9 % 11.8 % 7.9 % Yen/dollar exchange rate (end of period) 91.03 114.15 119.11 Aflac Japan (in yen) 4,903 4,648 4,341 Growth rate 5.5 % 7.1 % 7.9 % The growth of the future policy benefits liability in dollars is primarily due to the aging of our in force block of business and the addition of new business, as well as the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. New Accounting Pronouncements During the last three years, various accounting standard setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. For information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table is a presentation of items impacting net earnings and net earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31. Items Impacting Net Earnings In Millions Per Diluted Share 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Net earnings $ 1,254 $ 1,634 $ 1,483 $ 2.62 $ 3.31 $ 2.95 Items impacting net earnings, net of tax: Realized investment gains (losses) (655 ) 19 51 (1.37 ) .04 .10 Impact from SFAS 133 (3 ) 2 Realized Investment Gains and Losses Our investment strategy is to invest in investment grade fixed income securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the Companys profitability. This investment strategy aligns our assets with our liability structure, which our assets support. We do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and or general portfolio maintenance and rebalancing. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the principal drivers of our profitability. In 2008, we realized total pretax investment losses of $1,007 million (after tax, $655 million, or $1.37 per diluted share), primarily a result of the sale of securities and the recognition of other than temporary impairments. The sale of our investments in Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual and other smaller securities transactions represented $254 million ($166 million after tax) of the total realized investment losses. Other than temporary impairment losses during the year consisted of $294 million ($191 million after tax) recognized on certain of our perpetual security investments; $213 million ($139 million after tax) recognized on certain of our CDO investments; $180 million ($117 million after tax) recognized on our investments in three Icelandic banks; and $65 million ($42 million after tax) recognized on our investment in Ford Motor Company. See further discussion below regarding the other than temporary impairment losses on our perpetual securities, CDO investments and Icelandic bank investments. In 2007, we realized pretax investment gains of $28 million (after tax, $19 million, or $.04 per diluted share) primarily as a result of securities sold or redeemed in the normal course of business. In 2006, we realized pretax gains of $79 million (after tax, $51 million, or $.10 per diluted share) primarily as a result of bond swaps and the liquidation of equity securities held by Aflac U.S. We began a bond swap program in the second half of 2005 and concluded it in the first half of 2006. These bond swaps took advantage of tax loss carryforwards and also resulted in an improvement in overall portfolio credit quality and investment income. We maintain investments in subordinated financial instruments, or so called hybrid securities. Within this class of investments, we own perpetual Upper Tier II and Tier I securities, which are subordinated to other debt obligations of the issuer, but rank higher than the issuers equity securities. Perpetual securities have characteristics of 47 Table of Contents both debt and equity investments. Although these securities generally have no contractual maturity date, they have stated interest coupons that were fixed at their issuance and subsequently change to a floating short term rate of interest of 125 to more than 300 basis points above an appropriate market index, generally by the 25th year after issuance. We believe this interest step up penalty has the effect of creating an economic maturity date of the perpetual securities. Since first purchasing these securities in the early 1990s, and until the third quarter of 2008, we accounted for and reported perpetual securities as debt securities and classified them as both available for sale and held to maturity securities. In light of the unprecedented volatility in the debt and equity markets, we concluded in the third quarter of 2008 that all of our perpetual securities should be classified as available for sale securities for periods ending June 30, 2008 and prior. We also concluded that our perpetual securities should be evaluated for other than temporary impairments using an equity security impairment model as opposed to our previous policy of using a debt security impairment model. In the third quarter of 2008, we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of $191 million, after tax, which reflects the impact of applying our equity security impairment policy to this asset class through June 30, 2008. The June 30 measurement date was used following the SECs October 14, 2008 letter to the FASB on the topic of the appropriate impairment model to apply to perpetual securities. Included in this impairment charge is $40 million, $53 million, $50 million, and $38 million, net of tax, that relate to the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively; and, $10 million, net of tax, that relates to the quarter ended June 30, 2008. There were no impairment charges related to perpetual securities in the first quarter of 2008. The impact of classifying all of our perpetual securities as available for sale securities and assessing them for other than temporary impairments under our equity security impairment model through June 30, 2008, was determined to be immaterial to our results of operations and financial position for any previously reported period. In a letter to the FASB dated October 14, 2008, the SEC stated that, given the debt characteristics of perpetual securities, a debt impairment model could be used for filings subsequent to its letter, until the FASB further addresses the appropriate impairment approach. Consistent with the guidance in the SECs letter, we have applied a debt security impairment model to our perpetual securities subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and will continue with that approach pending further guidance from the FASB. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 92% of our perpetual securities portfolio was rated A or better, and the fair value of our perpetual security portfolio was approximately 89% and 84% of amortized cost and par value, respectively. As a part of our credit review process, we concluded that it had become unlikely that we would recover our investment in certain of our CDO investments as a result of continued significant declines in the credit markets during the fourth quarter of 2008. In accordance with our investment policy, we recorded an impairment charge of $164 million ($106 million after tax) in connection with the other than temporary impairment of these CDOs during the fourth quarter of 2008. During the third quarter of 2008, Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. (LBSF), the swap counterparty under four of our CDO debt securities, filed for bankrupty protection along with certain of its affiliates (including Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the guarantor of LBSFs obligations relating to the CDOs). We transferred these CDOs from held to maturity to available for sale as a result of the default by LBSF under the swaps. We have taken steps to cause these CDO securities to be redeemed. However, there is a significant risk that delays and or litigation associated with these redemptions may arise out of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings involving LBSF and its affiliates. 48 Table of Contents We hold investments in three Icelandic banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, in the form of junior subordinated debt, some of which include perpetual securities. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Icelandic government passed legislation that allowed certain distressed Icelandic financial institutions to be placed into receivership under the control of the Icelandic government. Following the passage of this legislation, the above noted Icelandic banks were placed into receivership and are now being operated by the Icelandic government, which is also in financial distress. Subsequent to these actions, we learned that it was unlikely that the banks or the Icelandic government have any intent to honor the banks obligations beyond their domestic depositors. As a result, we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of $180 million ($117 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2008 to reflect the other than temporary impairment of our total investment in these securities. At December 31, 2008, we classified our investments in Glitner, Landsbanki and Kaupthing as below investment grade. For additional information regarding realized investment gains and losses, please see Notes 1, 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impact from SFAS 133 We entered into cross currency swap agreements to effectively convert our dollar denominated senior notes, which mature in April 2009, into a yen denominated obligation (see Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We have designated the foreign currency component of these cross currency swaps as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan. The effect of issuing fixed rate, dollar denominated debt and swapping it into fixed rate, yen denominated debt has the same economic impact on Aflac as if we had issued yen denominated debt of a like amount. However, the accounting treatment for cross currency swaps is different from issuing yen denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133), requires that the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of the cross currency swaps, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, be reflected in net earnings. This change in fair value is determined by relative dollar and yen interest rates and has no cash impact on our results of operations. At maturity, the fair value will equal initial contract fair value, and the cumulative impact of gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the interest component will be zero. We have the ability and intent to retain the cross currency swaps until they expire in April 2009. The impact from SFAS 133 includes the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross currency swaps, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, and is included in other income. We have also issued yen denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes. We have designated these notes as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the value of these yen denominated notes and the notional amounts of the cross currency swaps exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, we would be required to recognize the foreign currency effect on the excess, or ineffective portion, in net earnings. The ineffective portion would be included in the impact from SFAS 133. These hedges were effective during the three year period ended December 31, 2008; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings. We have interest rate swap agreements related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes and have designated the swap agreements as a hedge of the variability of the debt cash flows. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. SFAS 133 requires that the change in the fair value of the swap contracts be recorded in other comprehensive income so long as the hedge is deemed effective. Any ineffectiveness would be recognized in net earnings (other income) and would be included in the impact from SFAS 133. These hedges were effective during 49 Table of Contents the three year period ended December 31, 2008; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings. See Notes 1, 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Foreign Currency Translation Aflac Japans premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen denominated assets to support yen denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. We translate Aflac Japans yen denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its yen denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our Company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, management evaluates Aflacs financial performance, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Income Taxes Our combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was 34.5% in 2008, 34.6% in 2007 and 34.5% in 2006. Total income taxes were $660 million in 2008, compared with $865 million in 2007 and $781 million in 2006. Japanese income taxes on Aflac Japans results account for most of our consolidated income tax expense. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 50 Table of Contents INSURANCE OPERATIONS Aflacs insurance business consists of two segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. Aflac Japan, which operates as a branch of Aflac, is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. GAAP financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual financial statements. Furthermore, we are required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets. We measure and evaluate our insurance segments financial performance using operating earnings on a pretax basis. We define segment operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. We believe that an analysis of segment pretax operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is conducted in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars. We evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales, an industry operating measure. Total new annualized premium sales, which include new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, represent the premiums that we would collect over a 12 month period, assuming the policies remain in force. For Aflac Japan, total new annualized premium sales are determined by applications written during the reporting period. For Aflac U.S., total new annualized premium sales are determined by applications that are accepted during the reporting period. Premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period. 51 Table of Contents AFLAC JAPAN SEGMENT Aflac Japan Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac Japans pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan Summary of Operating Results (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Premium income $ 10,674 $ 9,037 $ 8,762 Net investment income: Yen denominated investment income 1,312 1,102 1,064 Dollar denominated investment income 741 699 624 Net investment income 2,053 1,801 1,688 Other income 15 27 25 Total operating revenues 12,742 10,865 10,475 Benefits and claims 7,972 6,935 6,847 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 405 318 285 Insurance commissions 970 850 859 Insurance and other expenses 1,145 941 832 Total operating expenses 2,520 2,109 1,976 Total benefits and expenses 10,492 9,044 8,823 Pretax operating earnings* $ 2,250 $ 1,821 $ 1,652 Weighted average yen/dollar exchange rate 103.46 117.93 116.31 In Dollars In Yen Percentage change over previous year: 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Premium income 18.1 % 3.1 % .2 % 3.5 % 4.3 % 5.9 % Net investment income 14.0 6.7 3.2 8.0 9.0 Total operating revenues 17.3 3.7 .6 2.8 4.9 6.3 Pretax operating earnings* 23.6 10.2 9.1 8.4 11.8 15.4 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MDA for our definition of segment operating earnings. The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of 3.2% in 2008, 3.9% in 2007 and 5.4% in 2006 reflect the high persistency of Aflac Japans business and the sales of new policies. Annualized premiums in force at December 31, 2008, were 1.16 trillion yen, compared with 1.13 trillion yen in 2007 and 1.08 trillion yen in 2006. Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year end exchange rates, were $12.8 billion in 2008, $9.9 billion in 2007, and $9.1 billion in 2006. Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar denominated and reverse dual currency securities (yen denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). Dollar denominated investment income from these assets accounted for approximately 36% of Aflac Japans investment income in 2008, 52 Table of Contents compared with 39% in 2007 and 37% in 2006. In years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating Aflac Japans dollar denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen weakens, translating dollar denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. On a constant currency basis, dollar denominated investment income accounted for approximately 39% of Aflac Japans investment income during 2008, compared with 39% in 2007 and 36% in 2006. The following table illustrates the effect of translating Aflac Japans dollar denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year. Aflac Japan Percentage Changes Over Prior Year (Yen Operating Results) Including Foreign Currency Changes Excluding Foreign Currency Changes** 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Net investment income % 8.0 % 9.0 % 5.0 % 7.4 % 6.8 % Total operating revenues 2.8 4.9 6.3 3.8 4.9 6.0 Pretax operating earnings* 8.4 11.8 15.4 13.8 11.3 13.3 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MDA for our definition of segment operating earnings. ** Amounts excluding foreign currency changes on dollar denominated items were determined using the same yen/dollar exchange rate for the current year as each respective prior year. The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac Japan. Ratios to total revenues: 2008 2007 2006 Benefits and claims 62.5 % 63.8 % 65.4 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 3.2 2.9 2.7 Insurance commissions 7.6 7.8 8.2 Insurance and other expenses 9.0 8.7 7.9 Total operating expenses 19.8 19.4 18.8 Pretax operating earnings* 17.7 16.8 15.8 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MDA for our definition of segment operating earnings. The benefit ratio has declined over the past several years, reflecting the impact of newer products and riders with lower loss ratios. We have also experienced favorable claim trends in our major product lines. We expect the improvement in the benefit ratio to continue as we shift to newer products and riders and benefit from the impact of favorable claim trends. However, this improvement is partially offset by the effect of low investment yields, which impacts our profit margin by reducing the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves (see table and discussion in the Interest Rate Risk section of this MDA). The operating expense ratio increased modestly in 2008 in line with our expectations and primarily reflects the increased costs associated with IT infrastructure changes and our preparation for sales through the bank channel. We expect the operating expense ratio to increase slightly in 2009. Due to continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded in 2008. We expect continued expansion in the profit margin in 2009. 53 Table of Contents Aflac Japan Sales Our stated objective for 2008 was to increase sales 3% to 7%. We had anticipated growth from new sales distribution opportunities; however, our new bank channel sales were lower than expected and were negatively affected by the emergence of the financial crisis late in the year. Despite sales increasing slightly to 114.7 billion yen, we did not reach our sales target for 2008. The following table presents Aflac Japans total new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31. In Dollars In Yen (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Total new annualized premium sales $ 1,115 $ 974 $ 1,010 114.7 114.6 117.5 Percentage change over prior year 14.4 % (3.5 )% (13.5 )% % (2.4 )% (8.8 )% The following table details the contributions to total new annualized premium sales by major product for the years ended December 31. 2008 2007 2006 Medical policies 34 % 33 % 33 % Cancer 34 33 28 Ordinary life 23 22 23 Rider MAX 5 7 10 Other 4 5 6 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Cancer insurance was our top selling product category for Aflac Japan in 2008 with sales rising 3.6% over 2007. Aflac remains the best branded company in Japan for cancer insurance. Our cancer insurance marketing efforts in 2008 centered on Cancer Forte, which we introduced in September 2007. Cancer Forte offers increased outpatient benefits compared to the preceding version of this policy. In addition to our traditional first occurrence benefit, this product also pays an annuity to a newly diagnosed patient from the second year through the fifth year following diagnosis. It also assists policyholders with counseling and doctor referral services through a third party upon diagnosis of the disease. For consumers who had the earlier cancer insurance product, we introduced a special bridge policy in 2008 that allows existing policyholders to upgrade their coverage to that of Cancer Forte. As previously disclosed, Japan Post Network Co., Ltd., selected Aflac Japan in November 2007 as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through post offices located throughout the country. Japan Post Network Co. manages Japans vast network of more than 20,000 post offices, which have historically been popular places for consumers to purchase insurance products. We began selling cancer insurance through the Japan Post Network Co. in October 2008, with our product being offered initially through 300 of Japans post offices. We believe this new channel has the potential to be a solid contributor to our future sales. 54 Table of Contents Our cancer policies are also marketed through a strategic alliance with Dai ichi Mutual Life. In 2008, Dai ichi Life sold nearly 190,000 of our market leading cancer policies, retaining its distinction as the number two seller of cancer insurance behind only Aflac Japan. We are convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio. Medical sales increased 2.8% in 2008, compared with prior year. Since first launching a stand alone medical product called EVER in 2002, we have been the number one seller of medical insurance policies in Japan. We believe that our number one position benefits us in the marketplace. As a result, we continue to believe that the medical category will be an important part of our product portfolio. In the last five years, we have segmented the market by developing variations of EVER that appeal to specific types of Japanese consumers. Gentle EVER, introduced in 2007, provides an affordable alternative to help consumers who may have a health problem that would exclude them from purchasing other EVER products. With continued cost pressure on Japans health care system, we expect the need for medical products will continue to rise in the future, and we remain encouraged about the outlook for the medical insurance market. We continue to believe that sales of cancer and medical insurance will benefit from the recently opened bank channel. By the end of 2008, we had agreements with 242 banks to sell our products in their branches. We have significantly more selling agreements than any of our competitors. We believe our longstanding relationships within the Japan banking sector have given us an advantage in developing this channel. Furthering our reach into the banking channel was the endorsement of Aflacs products by the National Association of Shinkin Banks. This association of about 280 shinkin banks, which are similar to credit unions, chose Aflac as one of only four providers of third sector insurance products to its member banks. Aflac was the only foreign company chosen. In addition, Aflac was the only company selected for both cancer and medical insurance. We believe we are well positioned to see continued improvement in bank channel sales. In November 2008, we introduced a new product to the market called Sanjuso. This innovative new offering is a single premium product that provides lump sum payments upon the diagnosis of cancer, heart attack or stroke, as well as a death benefit. It was primarily designed for the bank channel. Initial sales of Sanjuso were negatively impacted by the financial crisis. However, we believe it will fit well in our bank agents product portfolios, particularly those of the mega banks and larger regional banks in Japan. We remain committed to selling through our traditional channels, which allows us to reach consumers through affiliated corporate agencies, independent corporate agencies and individual agencies. In 2008, we recruited approximately 3,950 new sales agencies. At the end of the year, Aflac Japan was represented by more than 18,800 sales agencies, or more than 107,400 licensed sales associates employed by those agencies. We believe that there is still a strong need for our products in Japan. Although we have a cautious outlook for sales in 2009 due to the current global economic uncertainty, our objective is for sales to be flat to up 5% in Japan, including continued growth in contributions from our new distribution channels (see the Japanese Regulatory Environment section of this MDA for further discussion regarding these distribution channels). Our sales objective could change if the Japanese economy experiences further deterioration. 55 Table of Contents Aflac Japan Investments Growth of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations, timing of and yields on new investments, and the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on dollar denominated investment income. Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than those available on Japanese government or other public corporate bonds, while still adhering to prudent standards for credit quality. All of our privately issued securities are rated investment grade at the time of purchase. These securities are generally issued with documentation consistent with standard medium term note programs. In addition, many of these investments have protective covenants appropriate to the specific issuer, industry and country. These covenants often require the issuer to adhere to specific financial ratios and give priority to repayment of our investment under certain circumstances. The following table presents the results of Aflac Japans investment activities for the years ended December 31. 2008 2007 2006 New money yield yen only 3.20 % 3.05 % 3.10 % New money yield blended 3.43 3.38 3.33 Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 3.82 4.06 4.11 At December 31, 2008, the yield on Aflac Japans investment portfolio, including dollar denominated investments, was 3.90%, compared with 4.02% a year ago. The overall credit quality of Aflac Japans investments remained high. At the end of 2008, 80.9% of our debt and perpetual securities were rated A or better on an amortized cost basis. Only 1.9% of Aflac Japans holdings were rated below investment grade at the end of 2008. See the Credit Risk section of this MDA for additional information. Japanese Economy The Bank of Japans January 2009 Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments stated that Japans economic conditions have been deteriorating significantly. Private consumption has weakened as a result of decreased household income and increased unemployment. Exports have decreased due to a slowdown in overseas economies and the appreciation of the yen. The report projected that Japans economic conditions are expected to continue to deteriorate. A broad economic stimulus plan has been proposed in Japan that would hopefully increase public spending. We believe that the Japanese economic situation is uncertain and that growth may not return until confidence is restored to the global financial markets. Japans system of compulsory public health care insurance provides medical coverage to every Japanese citizen. These public medical expenditures are covered by a combination of premiums paid by insureds and their employers, taxes and copayments from the people who receive medical service. However, given Japans aging population, the resources available to these publicly funded social insurance programs have come under increasing pressure. As a result, copayments and other out of pocket expenses have been rising and affecting more people. We believe higher out of pocket expenses will lead consumers to purchase more supplemental medical insurance. Many insurance companies have recognized the opportunities for selling supplemental medical insurance in Japan 56 Table of Contents and have launched new products in recent years. However, we believe our favorable cost structure compared with other insurers makes us a very effective competitor. In addition, we believe our brand, customer service and financial strength also benefit our market position. Japanese Regulatory Environment Japans Financial Services Agency (FSA) adopted new mortality tables for reserving newly underwritten policies effective April 2007. These new tables reflect recent improvements in survival rates in Japan and have generally resulted in a decrease in policy premiums for death benefit products and an increase in premium rates for third sector (health) products and annuities. We reflected the impact of the new mortality table in our product pricing for the first sector (life) products effective April 2007. For the third sector, the revised tables were reflected in our product pricing effective September 2007. Additionally, the FSA has implemented a new rule for third sector product reserving for our FSA based financial statements, effective April 1, 2007. Under the new rule, we are required to conduct stress testing of our reserves using a prescribed method that incorporates actual morbidity. The results of the tests and their relation to our reserves determine whether reserve strengthening is required. This new reserve requirement will not impact our GAAP financial statements. Adoption of this requirement did not have a material impact on our FSA based financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2008, or on our product pricing going forward. We expect that our distribution system will continue to evolve in Japan. Regulatory changes that took effect in December 2007 enable banks to sell our third sector products to their customers. Our strong brand as the leading seller of cancer and medical insurance products in Japan and our many long term relationships within the Japan banking sector place us in a strong position to sell through this new channel. By the end of 2008, we had agreements with 242 banks to market Aflacs products. In 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japans postal system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. The privatization laws split Japan Post into four entities that began operating in October 2007. The four entities are Japan Post Service Co., Ltd.; Japan Post Network Co., Ltd.; Japan Post Bank Co., Ltd.; and Japan Post Insurance Co., Ltd. In November 2007, Japan Post Network Co. selected Aflac Japan as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through Japans vast post office network. Japan Post Network Co. operates the 20,000 post offices located throughout Japan, providing a significant opportunity for us to reach new consumers. We began selling cancer insurance through the Japan Post Network Co. in October 2008, with our product being initially offered through 300 of Japans post offices. We believe this new channel has the potential to be a solid contributor to our future sales. 57 Table of Contents AFLAC U.S. SEGMENT Aflac U.S. Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac U.S. pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac U.S. Aflac U.S. Summary of Operating Results (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Premium income $ 4,272 $ 3,936 $ 3,552 Net investment income 505 500 465 Other income 10 10 10 Total operating revenues 4,787 4,446 4,027 Benefits and claims 2,527 2,350 2,169 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 370 323 290 Insurance commissions 488 481 444 Insurance and other expenses 657 600 539 Total operating expenses 1,515 1,404 1,273 Total benefits and expenses 4,042 3,754 3,442 Pretax operating earnings* $ 745 $ 692 $ 585 Percentage change over previous year: Premium income 8.5 % 10.8 % 9.5 % Net investment income .9 7.5 10.4 Total operating revenues 7.7 10.4 9.5 Pretax operating earnings* 7.6 18.3 11.4 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MDA for our definition of segment operating earnings. The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force of 6.2% in 2008, 10.0% in 2007 and 10.5% in 2006 were favorably affected by sales at the worksite and a slight improvement in the persistency of several products. Annualized premiums in force at December 31 were $4.8 billion in 2008, compared with $4.5 billion in 2007 and $4.1 billion in 2006. Net investment income was relatively flat during 2008, primarily as a result of funds utilized in our accelerated share repurchase programs in the first and third quarters of 2008. For further information, see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of this MDA and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 58 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac U.S. Ratios to total revenues: 2008 2007 2006 Benefits and claims 52.8 % 52.9 % 53.9 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 7.7 7.3 7.2 Insurance commissions 10.2 10.8 11.0 Insurance and other expenses 13.7 13.4 13.4 Total operating expenses 31.6 31.5 31.6 Pretax operating earnings* 15.6 15.6 14.5 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MDA for our definition of segment operating earnings. The benefit ratio, operating expense ratio and pretax operating profit margin for 2008 were relatively stable, compared with 2007. We expect the benefit ratio to decline modestly and the operating expense ratio and pretax operating profit margin to increase slightly in 2009. Aflac U.S. Sales In 2008, we believe the weak economy had a negative effect on the demand for the products we sell, resulting in a slight decrease in new annualized premium sales. The following table presents Aflacs U.S. total new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Total new annualized premium sales $ 1,551 $ 1,558 $ 1,423 Increase (decrease) over prior year (.4 )% 9.5 % 13.1 % Although we have a cautious outlook for sales in 2009 due to the current global economic uncertainty, our objective is for total new annualized premium sales to be flat to up 5% in the U.S. Our sales objective could change if the U.S. economy experiences further deterioration. The following table details the contributions to total new annualized premium sales by major product category for the years ended December 31. 2008 2007 2006 Accident/disability coverage 49 % 51 % 52 % Cancer expense insurance 19 18 17 Hospital indemnity products 16 14 12 Fixed benefit dental coverage 5 6 6 Other 11 11 13 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Total new annualized premium sales for accident/disability, our leading product category, decreased 4.8% in 2008, while cancer expense insurance increased 4.2% and our hospital indemnity category increased 13.6%, compared with 2007. One aspect of our growth strategy is the continued enhancement of our product line. In 2008, we primarily directed our efforts to helping consumers broaden their coverage by pairing existing policies 59 Table of Contents that complement one anothers coverage. We launched a product portfolio initiative in 2008 that provided sales associates with the support and enrollment technology to offer defined combinations of products, or portfolios, that provide breadth and or depth of coverage for diverse medical health events. A popular portfolio combination includes pairing our accident product in conjunction with our personal sickness indemnity product. We are also pairing life products with any other supplemental policy we offer. As a result of this approach, life premiums and policies showed double digit increases for the year. Another aspect of our growth strategy is our focus on growing and improving our U.S. sales force. We remain satisfied with our progress in the ongoing expansion of our U.S. sales force. We recruited more than 25,700 new sales associates in 2008, resulting in more than 74,300 licensed sales associates at December 31, 2008, a 4.4% increase compared with 2007. On a weekly basis, the average number of U.S. associates actively producing business rose 2.6% to more than 11,200 in 2008. We believe that the average weekly producing sales associates metric allows our sales management to actively monitor progress and needs on a real time basis. Furthermore, we believe the increase in producing sales associates reflects the success of the training programs we implemented over the last few years. With total new payroll accounts rising 6.3% in 2008, we believe we have added shelf space that will lead to better sales when the economy stabilizes. In 2008, we intensified preparation for our new Aflac for Brokers initiative that we expect to implement in 2009. Insurance brokers have been a historically underleveraged sales channel for Aflac, and we believe we can establish relationships that will complement, not compete with, our traditional distribution system. We have assembled an experienced broker team, and we are supporting this initiative with streamlined products, specific advertising, and customized enrollment technology. Additionally, a new level of management has been introduced in 2009 to deliver this initiative. Broker Development Coordinators have been hired in most of our state operations to initiate contact with new brokers as well as develop relationships with our current brokers. These coordinators will be assisted by a team of certified case managers whose purpose will be to coordinate the enrollments created by our Broker Development Coordinators. U.S. Economy Operating in the U.S. economy was a challenge in 2008. The weak economic environment has likely had an impact on some of our policyholders, potential customers and sales associates, and the recent stock market turmoil has added to consumer unease. In addition, Hurricane Ike severely disrupted sales activities in Texas, our largest state in terms of new sales. Although we believe that the weakened U.S. economy has been a contributing factor to slower sales growth, we also believe our products remain affordable to the average American consumer. Consumers underlying need for our U.S. product line has not changed, and we believe that the United States remains a sizeable and attractive market. Aflac U.S. Investments The following table presents the results of Aflacs U.S. investment activities. 2008 2007 2006 New money yield 7.60 % 6.44 % 6.44 % Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 6.77 6.79 6.86 The increase in the U.S. new money yield reflects widening credit spreads globally. At December 31, 2008, the portfolio yield on Aflacs U.S. portfolio was 7.10%, compared with 7.00% a 60 Table of Contents year ago. During the second quarter of 2008, we purchased $200 million of variable interest rate CDOs that support $200 million of variable interest rate funding agreements issued by Aflac U.S. Because these CDOs do not support our core policyholder benefit obligations, the yield on these CDOs is not included in the Aflac U.S. portfolio yield or in the yields listed in the above table. The overall credit quality of Aflac U.S. investments remained high. Based on amortized cost, 98.4% of our holdings were rated investment grade at the end of 2008, and only 1.6% were rated below investment grade. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Credit Risk section of this MDA for additional information. OTHER OPERATIONS Corporate operating expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation, benefits and facilities expenses. Corporate expenses, excluding investment income, were $61 million in 2008, $56 million in 2007 and $57 million in 2006. Investment income included in reported corporate expenses was $20 million in 2008, $31 million in 2007 and $16 million in 2006. 61 Table of Contents ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations. The yen/dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen denominated balance sheet items to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The following table demonstrates the effect of the change in the yen/dollar exchange rate by comparing select balance sheet items as reported at December 31, 2008, with the amounts that would have been reported had the exchange rate remained unchanged from December 31, 2007. Foreign Exchange Effected Balance Sheet Items As Exchange Net of (In millions) Reported Effect Exchange Effect Yen/dollar exchange rate* 91.03 114.15 Investments and cash $ 68,550 $ 11,856 $ 56,694 Deferred policy acquisition costs 8,237 1,143 7,094 Total assets 79,331 13,312 66,020 Policy liabilities 66,219 12,044 54,174 Total liabilities 72,692 13,180 59,512 * The exchange rate at December 31, 2008, was 91.03 yen to one dollar, or 25.4% stronger than the December 31, 2007, exchange rate of 114.15. Market Risks of Financial Instruments Our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while emphasizing liquidity, safety and quality. Our investment objective, subject to appropriate risk constraints, is to fund policyholder obligations and other liabilities in a manner that enhances shareholders equity. We seek to achieve this objective through a diversified portfolio of fixed income investments that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities it supports. Aflac invests primarily within the fixed income debt and perpetual securities markets. 62 Table of Contents The following table details investment securities by segment as of December 31. Investment Securities by Segment Aflac Japan Aflac U.S. (In millions) 2008 2007 2008 2007 Securities available for sale, at fair value: Fixed maturities $ 29,140 $ 23,532 $ 5,772 * $ 6,874 * Perpetual securities 7,843 3,758 204 331 Equity securities 27 28 Total available for sale 37,010 27,318 5,976 7,205 Securities held to maturity, at amortized cost: Fixed maturities 24,236 16,799 200 20 Perpetual securities 3,985 Total held to maturity 24,236 20,784 200 20 Total investment securities $ 61,246 $ 48,102 $ 6,176 $ 7,225 * Excludes investment grade, available for sale fixed maturity securities held by the Parent Company of $100 in 2008 and $105 in 2007. During the third quarter of 2008, we reclassified our held to maturity perpetual securities to available for sale. These securities have characteristics of both debt and equity investments. Since first purchasing these securities in the early 1990s, we have accounted for and reported perpetual securities as both available for sale and held to maturity securities. However, in light of the recent unprecedented volatility in the debt and equity markets, we have concluded that all of our perpetual securities should be classified as available for sale. See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Realized Investment Gains and Losses section of this MDA for additional information. During the second quarter of 2008, Aflac U.S. used the proceeds from the issuance of $200 million of variable interest rate funding agreements to third party investors to purchase a corresponding amount of variable interest rate CDOs. These CDOs were purchased exclusively to support our obligation under the funding agreements and are classified as fixed maturities in the Aflac U.S. held to maturity portfolio. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Because we invest in fixed income securities, our financial instruments are exposed primarily to three types of market risks: currency risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Currency Risk The functional currency of Aflac Japans insurance operation is the Japanese yen. All of Aflac Japans premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as are most of its investment income and other expenses. Furthermore, most of Aflac Japans investments, cash and liabilities are yen denominated. When yen denominated securities mature or are sold, the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen denominated securities. Aflac Japan holds these yen denominated assets to fund its yen denominated policy obligations. In addition, Aflac Incorporated has yen denominated notes payable and cross currency swaps related to its dollar denominated senior notes. 63 Table of Contents Although we generally do not convert yen into dollars, we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. On a consolidated basis, we attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders equity to foreign currency translation fluctuations. We accomplish this by investing a portion of Aflac Japans investment portfolio in dollar denominated securities, by the Parent Companys issuance of yen denominated debt and by the use of cross currency swaps (for additional information, see the discussion under Hedging Activities as follows in this section of MDA). As a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is reduced. The dollar values of our yen denominated net assets, which are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations for financial reporting purposes, are summarized as follows (translated at end of period exchange rates) for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2008 2007 Aflac Japan yen denominated net assets $ 2,528 $ 2,415 Parent Company yen denominated net liabilities (1,876 ) (1,496 ) Consolidated yen denominated net assets subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations $ 652 $ 919 The decrease in our yen denominated net asset position resulted from the continuing decline in the market value of our yen denominated available for sale investment securities as a result of widening credit spreads globally. 64 Table of Contents The following table demonstrates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of our yen denominated assets and liabilities, and our consolidated yen denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of December 31.

This primarily occurs when we repatriate funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., which is generally done annually. The exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. A portion of the repatriation may be used to service Aflac Incorporateds yen denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars. Interest Rate Risk Our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt and perpetual securities. We use a modified duration analysis modeling 65 Table of Contents approach, which measures price percentage volatility, to estimate the sensitivity of the fair values of our investments to interest rate changes on the debt and perpetual securities we own. For example, if the current duration of a debt security or perpetual security is 10, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. Likewise, the fair value of the debt security or perpetual security will decrease by approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. We believe a principal cause of the increase in gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale is the effect of widening credit spreads on Aflac Japans long duration invested assets. The estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt and perpetual securities we own, notes payable, cross currency and interest rate swaps and our obligation to the Japanese policyholder protection corporation as of December 31 follows: Sensitivity of Fair Values of Financial Instruments to Interest Rate Changes 2008 2007 100 100 Fair Basis Fair Basis (In millions) Value Points Value Points Debt and perpetual securities: Fixed maturity securities: Yen denominated $ 49,047 $ 43,556 $ 36,314 $ 32,151 Dollar denominated 9,048 8,246 10,388 9,505 Perpetual securities: Yen denominated 7,804 7,103 7,598 6,889 Dollar denominated 244 225 431 395 Total debt and perpetual securities $ 66,143 $ 59,130 $ 54,731 $ 48,940 Notes payable* $ 1,713 $ 1,530 $ 1,452 $ 1,415 Cross currency and interest rate swap liabilities $ 158 $ 151 $ 35 $ 27 Japanese policyholder protection corporation $ 161 $ 161 $ 151 $ 151 * Excludes capitalized lease obligations There are various factors that affect the fair value of our investment in debt and perpetual securities. Included in those factors are changes in the prevailing interest rate environment. Changes in the interest rate environment directly affect the balance of unrealized gains or losses for a given period in relation to a prior period. Decreases in market yields generally improve the fair value of debt and perpetual securities while increases in market yields generally have a negative impact on the fair value of our debt and perpetual securities. However, we do not expect to realize a majority of any unrealized gains or losses because we have the intent and ability to hold such securities until a recovery of value, which may be maturity. For additional information on unrealized losses on debt and perpetual securities, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 66 Table of Contents We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. The following table presents the approximate duration of our yen denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of December 31. (In years) 2008 2007 Yen denominated debt securities 12 13 Policy benefits and related expenses to be paid in future years 14 14 Premiums to be received in future years on policies in force 10 10 The following table shows a comparison of average required interest rates for future policy benefits and investment yields, based on amortized cost, for the years ended December 31. Comparison of Interest Rates for Future Policy Benefits and Investment Yields (Net of Investment Expenses) 2008 2007 2006 U.S. Japan* U.S. Japan* U.S. Japan* Policies issued during year: Required interest on policy reserves 5.50 % 2.74 % 5.50 % 2.74 % 5.50 % 2.77 % New money yield on investments 7.56 3.27 6.40 3.11 6.40 3.12 Policies in force during year: Required interest on policy reserves 6.12 4.55 6.20 4.63 6.28 4.71 Return on average invested assets 6.77 3.82 6.79 3.83 6.86 3.88 * Represents yen denominated investments for Aflac Japan that support policy obligations and therefore excludes Aflac Japans annuities, and dollar denominated investments and related investment income We continue to monitor the spread between our new money yield and the required interest assumption for newly issued products in both the United States and Japan and will re evaluate those assumptions as necessary. Over the next two years, we have yen denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of Aflac Japans current net investment yield of 3.61%. These securities total $2.0 billion at amortized cost and have an average yield of 5.74%. Currently, when debt and perpetual securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, adding riders to our older policies has helped offset negative investment spreads on these policies. Overall, adequate profit margins exist in Aflac Japans aggregate block of business because of profits that have emerged from changes in the mix of business and favorable experience from mortality, morbidity and expenses. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements related to our 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes. These agreements effectively swap the variable interest rate Uridashi notes to fixed rate notes to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. For further information, see Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 67 Table of Contents Credit Risk Our investment activities expose us to credit risk, which is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying investment positions. However, we continue to adhere to prudent standards for credit quality. We accomplish this by considering our product needs and overall corporate objectives, in addition to credit risk. In evaluating the initial rating, we look at the overall senior issuer rating, the explicit rating for the actual issue or the rating for the security class, and, where applicable, the appropriate designation from the Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). All of our securities have ratings from either a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or the SVO of the NAIC. In addition, we perform extensive internal credit reviews to ensure that we are consistent in applying rating criteria for all of our securities. The following table shows the subordination distribution of our debt and perpetual securities.

We maintained investments in subordinated financial instruments, that comprised 26.5% of our total investments in debt and perpetual securities at December 31, 2008. These investments primarily consisted of Lower Tier II, Upper Tier II, and Tier I securities. The Lower Tier II securities are debt instruments with fixed maturities. Our Upper Tier II and Tier I investments consisted of debt instruments with fixed maturities and perpetual securities, which have an economic maturity as opposed to a stated maturity. Perpetual securities comprise 95% and 77% of our total Upper Tier II and Tier I investments, respectively as of December 31, 2008. 68 Table of Contents The amortized cost for our investments in debt and perpetual securities, the cost for equity securities and the fair values of these investments at December 31 are shown in the following tables. 2008 Cost or Gross Gross Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair (In millions) Cost Gains Losses Value Securities available for sale, carried at fair value: Fixed maturities: Yen denominated: Government and guaranteed $ 11,153 $ 988 $ 16 $ 12,125 Mortgage and asset backed securities 491 8 499 Public utilities 2,282 188 17 2,453 Collateralized debt obligations 253 6 259 Sovereign and supranational 943 37 126 854 Banks/financial institutions 4,667 81 686 4,062 Other corporate 6,183 155 576 5,762 Total yen denominated 25,972 1,463 1,421 26,014 Dollar denominated: Government and guaranteed 266 6 1 271 Municipalities 119 1 14 106 Mortgage and asset backed securities 738 7 189 556 Collateralized debt obligations 53 37 16 Public utilities 1,337 34 165 1,206 Sovereign and supranational 366 44 9 401 Banks/financial institutions 2,910 107 529 2,488 Other corporate 4,273 182 501 3,954 Total dollar denominated 10,062 381 1,445 8,998 Total fixed maturities 36,034 1,844 2,866 35,012 Perpetual securities: Yen denominated: Banks/financial institutions 8,400 187 1,091 7,496 Other corporate 294 13 307 Dollar denominated: Banks/financial institutions 380 136 244 Total perpetual securities 9,074 200 1,227 8,047 Equity securities 24 5 2 27 Total securities available for sale $ 45,132 $ 2,049 $ 4,095 $ 43,086 69 Table of Contents 2008 Cost or Gross Gross Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair (In millions) Cost Gains Losses Value Securities held to maturity, carried at amortized cost: Fixed maturities: Yen denominated: Government and guaranteed $ 220 $ 17 $ $ 237 Mortgage and asset backed securities 75 1 1 75 Collateralized debt obligations 403 295 108 Public utilities 3,951 168 66 4,053 Sovereign and supranational 3,582 93 132 3,543 Banks/financial institutions 12,291 147 1,195 11,243 Other corporate 3,714 145 84 3,775 Total yen denominated 24,236 571 1,773 23,034 Dollar denominated: Collateralized debt obligations 200 150 50 Total dollar denominated 200 150 50 Total securities held to maturity $ 24,436 $ 571 $ 1,923 $ 23,084 70 Table of Contents 2007 Cost or Gross Gross Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair (In millions) Cost Gains Losses Value Securities available for sale, carried at fair value: Fixed maturities: Yen denominated: Government and guaranteed $ 8,438 $ 621 $ 36 $ 9,023 Mortgage and asset backed securities 272 6 278 Public utilities 1,741 162 31 1,872 Sovereign and supranational 751 54 31 774 Banks/financial institutions 3,814 228 112 3,930 Other corporate 4,406 131 271 4,266 Total yen denominated 19,422 1,202 481 20,143 Dollar denominated: Government 376 7 1 382 Municipalities 128 3 5 126 Mortgage and asset backed securities 502 6 14 494 Collateralized debt obligations 92 16 76 Public utilities 1,007 73 13 1,067 Sovereign and supranational 424 80 2 502 Banks/financial institutions 3,157 165 106 3,216 Other corporate 4,291 302 88 4,505 Total dollar denominated 9,977 636 245 10,368 Total fixed maturities 29,399 1,838 726 30,511 Perpetual securities: Yen denominated: Banks/financial institutions 3,549 123 253 3,419 Other Corporate 263 18 245 Dollar denominated: Banks/financial institutions 455 8 38 425 Total perpetual securities 4,267 131 309 4,089 Equity securities 21 8 1 28 Total securities available for sale $ 33,687 $ 1,977 $ 1,036 $ 34,628 71 Table of Contents 2007 Cost or Gross Gross Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair (In millions) Cost Gains Losses Value Securities held to maturity, carried at amortized cost: Fixed maturities: Yen denominated: Government $ 175 $ $ 1 $ 174 Mortgage and asset backed securities 43 43 Collateralized debt obligations 403 79 324 Public utilities 1,937 18 66 1,889 Sovereign and supranational 3,069 78 69 3,078 Banks/financial institutions 8,976 85 644 8,417 Other corporate 2,196 92 42 2,246 Total yen denominated 16,799 273 901 16,171 Dollar denominated: Government 20 20 Total dollar denominated 20 20 Total fixed maturities 16,819 273 901 16,191 Perpetual securities: Yen denominated: Banks/financial institutions 3,985 135 186 3,934 Total perpetual securities 3,985 135 186 3,934 Total securities held to maturity $ 20,804 $ 408 $ 1,087 $ 20,125 The methods of determining the fair values of our investments in debt securities, perpetual securities and equity securities are described in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our investment discipline begins with a top down approach for each investment opportunity we consider. Consistent with that approach, we first approve each country in which we invest. In our approach to sovereign analysis, we consider the political, legal and financial context of the sovereign entity in which an issuer is domiciled and operates. Next we approve the issuers industry sector, including such factors as the stability of results and the importance of the sector to the overall economy. Specific credit names within approved countries and industry sectors are evaluated for their market position and specific strengths and potential weaknesses. Structures in which we invest are chosen for specific portfolio management purposes, including asset/liability management, portfolio diversification and net investment income. Our largest investment industry sector concentration is banks and financial institutions. Within the countries we approve for investment opportunities, we primarily invest in financial institutions that are strategically crucial to each approved countrys economy. The banks and financial institutions sector is a highly regulated industry and plays a strategic role in the global economy. We achieve some degree of diversification in the banks and financial institutions sector through a geographically diverse universe of credit exposures. Within this sector, the more significant concentration of our credit risk by 72 Table of Contents geographic region or country of issuer at December 31, 2008, based on amortized cost, was: Europe (48%); United States (20%); United Kingdom (9%); and Japan (9%).

Included in our top 30 holdings are legacy issues that date back many years. Additionally, the concentration of certain of our holdings of individual credit exposures has grown over time through merger and consolidation activity. Beginning in 2005, we have, as a general rule, limited our investment exposures to issuers to no more than 5% of total adjusted capital (TAC) on a statutory basis with the exception of obligations of the Japan and U.S. governments. However, existing investment exposures that exceeded 5% of TAC at the time this rule was adopted or exposures that may exceed this threshold from time to time through merger and consolidation activity 74 Table of Contents are not automatically reduced through sales of the issuers securities but rather are reduced over time consistent with our investment policy. As a significant amount of these securities are yen denominated, the size of the position was also magnified in dollar terms as the yen strengthened 25.4% relative to the U.S. dollar from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008. We have investments in both publicly and privately issued securities. The outstanding amount of a particular issuance, as well as the level of activity in a particular issuance and market conditions, including credit events and the interest rate environment, affect liquidity regardless of whether it is publicly or privately issued. 75 Table of Contents The following table details investment securities by type of issuance as of December 31.

Aflac Japans investments in yen denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non Japanese issuers and have longer maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our asset/liability matching and our overall investment returns. Most of our privately issued securities are issued under medium term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and or event risk covenants are required. We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and 76 Table of Contents internal credit analysis. The distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the years ended December 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows: Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating 2008 2007 2006 AAA 9.9 % 18.4 % 10.6 % AA 36.4 44.1 48.9 A 42.0 30.2 35.1 BBB 11.7 7.3 5.4 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The percentage increase of debt securities purchased in the BBB rated category during the year was due to the attractive relative value these securities presented while still meeting our investment policy guidelines for liquidity, safety and quality. The increased percentage of debt securities purchased in the AAA rated category in 2007 primarily reflects the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills by Aflac Japan prior to repatriating profits to Aflac U.S. in the third quarter of 2007. We did not purchase any perpetual securities during the periods presented in the table above. The distributions of debt and perpetual securities we own, by credit rating, as of December 31 were as follows: Composition by Credit Rating 2008 2007 Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Cost Value Cost Value AAA 5.7 % 5.8 % 6.3 % 6.2 % AA 39.8 42.2 44.3 45.3 A 34.1 33.2 30.7 30.4 BBB 18.6 17.6 16.8 16.6 BB or lower 1.8 1.2 1.9 1.5 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Although our investment portfolio continues to be of high credit quality, many downgrades occurred during 2008, causing a shift in composition by credit rating. The percentage of AA rated securities decreased primarily as a result of downgrades of certain banks and financial institutions investments and CDO investments. The percentage of A rated securities increased principally due to purchases and downgrades of higher rated securities. BBB rated securities increased primarily due to purchases and downgrades of higher rated securities. The fair value of our debt and perpetual security investments fluctuates based on changes in credit spreads in the global financial markets. Credit spreads are most impacted by market rates of interest, the credit environment and market liquidity globally. We believe that fluctuations in the fair value of our investment securities related to changes in credit spreads have little bearing on whether our investment is ultimately recoverable. Therefore, we consider such declines in fair value to be temporary even in situations where the specific decline of an investments fair value below its cost exceeds a year or more. 77 Table of Contents We do not automatically recognize an impairment if a securitys amortized cost exceeds its fair value. Instead, we consistently apply our impairment policy to determine if an impairment charge is warranted. Once we designate a debt security as below investment grade, our investment management intensifies its monitoring of the issuer. Included in this process are an evaluation of the issuer, its current credit posture and an assessment of the future prospects for the issuer. We then obtain fair value information from independent pricing sources. Upon determining the fair value, we move our focus to an analysis of whether or not the decline in fair value of the debt security, if any, is other than temporary. Investment management then reviews the issue based on our debt impairment policy, which includes, but is not limited to, an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold the investment until a full recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, to determine if the investment should be impaired and or liquidated. For securities evaluated under an equity impairment model, investment management reviews the length of time of the decline in fair value below cost or amortized cost and the severity of the decline to determine if the investment should be impaired and or liquidated. In the course of our credit review process, we may determine that it is unlikely that we will recover our investment in an issuer due to factors specific to an individual issuer, as opposed to general changes in global credit spreads. In this event, we consider such a decline in the investments fair value, to the extent below the investments cost or amortized cost, to be an other than temporary impairment of the investment and write the investment down to its recoverable value, which is normally its fair value. The determination of whether an impairment is other than temporary is subjective and involves the consideration of various factors and circumstances. These factors include more significantly: the severity of the decline in fair value the length of time the fair value is below cost issuer financial condition, including profitability and cash flows credit status of the issuer the issuers specific and general competitive environment published reports general economic environment regulatory and legislative environment other factors as may become available from time to time Another factor we consider in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary is our ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of its fair value. We perform ongoing analyses of our liquidity needs, which includes cash flow testing of our policy liabilities, debt maturities, projected dividend payments and other cash flow and liquidity needs. Our cash flow testing includes extensive duration matching of our investment portfolio and policy liabilities. Based on our analyses, we have concluded that we have sufficient excess cash flows to meet our liquidity needs without liquidating any of our investments prior to their maturity. In addition, provided that our credit review process results in a conclusion that we will collect all of our cash flows and recover our investment in an issuer, we generally do not sell investments prior to their maturity. The majority of our investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairment using our debt impairment model. Our debt impairment model, which is used for statutory accounting and, subject to certain exceptions, GAAP focuses on the ultimate collection of the cash flows from our investment as well as our ability and intent to hold the security until a recovery of value, which may be maturity. However, under GAAP a limited number of our investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairment under our equity impairment model. Our equity impairment model considers the same factors as our debt model but puts a primary focus on the severity of a securitys decline in fair value coupled with the length of time the securitys value has been impaired. The final assessment of whether a decline in fair value of any of our securities is other than temporary requires significant management judgment and is discussed more fully in the Critical 78 Table of Contents Accounting Estimates section of this MDA and in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event of a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade status, we do not automatically liquidate our position. However, if the security is in the held to maturity portfolio, we immediately transfer it to the available for sale portfolio so that the securitys fair value and its unrealized gain or loss are reflected on the balance sheet. Debt and perpetual securities classified as below investment grade at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were all reported as available for sale and carried at fair value. The below investment grade securities at December 31 were as follows: Below Investment Grade Securities 2008 2007 Par Amortized Fair Par Amortized Fair (In millions) Value Cost Value Value Cost Value Ford Motor Credit $ 329 $ 329 $ 143 $ 263 $ 263 $ 215 Ahold * * * 310 311 272 CSAV 264 264 157 210 210 143 BAWAG*** 154 133 88 123 123 90 IKB Deutsche Industriebank 143 143 47 * * * Beryl Finance Limited 2008 7**** 110 110 116 * * * Ford Motor Company 111 57 31 111 122 93 Glitnir Bank HF 95 (1) * * * Beryl Finance Limited 2007 14**** 82 53 53 * * * Beryl Finance Limited 2006 15**** 55 43 43 * * * Beryl Finance Limited 2007 5**** 55 44 44 * * * Morgan Stanley Aces 2007 21**** 55 3 3 * * * Landsbanki Islands HF 55 * * * Rinker Materials Corp 43 42 23 * * * Morgan Stanley Aces 2007 19**** 30 4 4 * * * Kaupthing Bank*** 30 * * * Sprint Capital 22 24 16 * * * Academica Charter Schools Finance LLC 22 24 17 * * * International Securities Trading Corp. 18 20 Tiers Georgia**** 11 1 1 * * * Patrick Family Housing (Patrick AFB) ** ** ** 4 1 1 Aloha Utilities Inc. ** ** ** 2 2 1 Total $ 1,684 $ 1,274 $ 786 $ 1,043 $ 1,032 $ 815 * Investment grade at respective reporting date ** Sold during 2008 *** Perpetual security **** CDO security (1) Includes $55 million for a perpetual security 79 Table of Contents Occasionally, a debt or perpetual security will be split rated. This occurs when one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade. Our policy is to review each issue on a case by case basis to determine if a split rated security should be classified as investment grade or below investment grade. Our review includes evaluating the issuers credit position as well as current market pricing and other factors, such as the issuers or securitys inclusion on a credit rating downgrade watch list.

Investment Valuation and Cash SFAS 157 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. These two types of inputs create three valuation hierarchy levels. Level 1 valuations reflect quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 valuations reflect quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets or model derived valuations in which all significant valuation inputs are observable in active markets. Level 3 valuations reflect valuations in which one or more of the significant valuation inputs are not observable in an active market. The vast majority of our financial instruments subject to the classification provisions of SFAS 157 relate to our investment securities classified as securities available for sale in our investment portfolio. We determine the fair value of our securities available for sale using several sources or techniques based on the type and nature of the investment securities. For securities categorized as Level 1, we obtain quoted market prices for identical securities traded in active markets that are readily and regularly available to us. For securities categorized as Level 2, we determine the fair value using three techniques, depending on the source and availability of market inputs. Of these securities, approximately 36% are valued by obtaining quoted prices from our custodian. The custodian obtains price quotes from various pricing services who estimate their fair values based on observable market transactions for similar investments in active markets, market transactions for the same investments in inactive markets or other observable market data where available. 83 Table of Contents The fair value of approximately 59% of our Level 2 securities is determined using discounted cash flow (DCF) pricing models that employ observable and corroborated market inputs from both active and inactive markets. The estimated fair values developed by the DCF pricing models are most sensitive to prevailing credit spreads, the level of interest rates (yields) and interest rate volatility. Credit spreads are derived based on pricing data obtained from investment brokers and take into account the current yield curve, time to maturity and subordination levels for similar securities or classes of securities. We validate the reliability of the DCF pricing models periodically by using the models to price investments for which there are quoted market prices from active markets or, in the alternative, are quoted by our custodian. For the remaining Level 2 securities that are not quoted by our custodian and cannot be priced under the DCF pricing model, we obtain specific broker quotes from up to three brokers and use the average of the three quotes to estimate the fair value of the securities. The fair value of our securities classified as Level 3 is estimated by obtaining broker quotes from a limited number of brokers. These brokers base their quotes on a combination of their knowledge of the current pricing environment and market flows. We consider these inputs unobservable. As a result of the continued contraction of observable valuation inputs, we transferred investments totaling $2.7 billion into Level 3 during the fourth quarter of 2008. Included in these transfers were our below investment grade investments, callable reverse dual currency (RDC) investments and certain of our private placement securities. Transfers into Level 3 prior to the fourth quarter totaled $245 million and consisted of various other hard to value investment securities. The significant valuation inputs that are used in the valuation process for the below investment grade, callable RDC and private placement investments classified as Level 3 include forward exchange rates, yen swap rates, dollar swap rates, interest rate volatilities, credit spread data on specific issuers, assumed default and default recovery rates, certain probability assumptions, and call option data. Some of these securities require the calculation of a theoretical forward exchange rate which is developed by using yen swap rates, U.S. dollar swap rates, interest rate volatilities, and spot exchange rates. The forward exchange rate is then used to convert all future dollar cash flows of the bond, where applicable, into yen cash flows. Additionally, credit spreads for the individual issuers are key valuation inputs for these securities. Finally, in pricing securities with a call option, the assumptions regarding interest rates in the U.S. and Japan are considered to be significant valuation inputs. Collectively, these valuation inputs, are used to estimate the fair values of these securities at each reporting date. In obtaining the above valuation inputs, we have determined that certain pricing assumptions and data used by our pricing sources are becoming increasingly more difficult to validate or corroborate by the market and or appear to be internally developed rather than observed in or corroborated by the market. The use of these unobservable valuation inputs causes more subjectivity in the valuation process for these securities and, consequently, causes more volatility in their estimated fair values. We estimate the fair values of our securities available for sale on a monthly basis. We monitor the estimated fair values from each of the sources described above for consistency from month to month and based on current market conditions. We also periodically discuss with our custodian and pricing brokers the pricing techniques they use to monitor the consistency of their approach and periodically assess the appropriateness of the valuation level assigned to the values obtained from them. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the classification of our securities available for sale under the provisions of SFAS 157 as of December 31, 2008. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $.9 billion, or 1.4% of total investments and cash, as of December 31, 2008, compared with $1.6 billion, or 2.7%, at December 31, 2007. For a discussion of the factors causing the change in our cash balance, see the Operating Activities, Investing Activities and Financing Activities sections of this MDA. For additional information concerning our investments, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs The following table presents deferred policy acquisition costs by segment for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2008 2007 % Change Aflac Japan $ 5,644 $ 4,269 32.2 %* Aflac U.S. 2,593 2,385 8.7 Total $ 8,237 $ 6,654 23.8 % * Aflac Japans deferred policy acquisition costs increased 5.4% in yen during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in deferred policy acquisition costs was primarily driven by total new annualized premium sales and the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. 84 Table of Contents Policy Liabilities The following table presents policy liabilities by segment for the years ending December 31. (In millions) 2008 2007 % Change Aflac Japan $ 59,466 $ 44,694 33.1 %* Aflac U.S. 6,750 5,979 12.9 Other 3 3 Total $ 66,219 $ 50,676 30.7 % * Aflac Japans policy liabilities increased 6.1% in yen during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in total policy liabilities is the result of the growth and aging of our in force business and the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. Notes Payable Notes payable totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007. Except for our senior notes, our debt is primarily yen denominated. The increase in notes payable is due to the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. There were no new borrowings or loan repayments in 2008. The ratio of debt to total capitalization (debt plus shareholders equity, excluding the unrealized gains and losses on investment securities) was 18.0% as of December 31, 2008, compared with 15.6% a year ago. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Benefit Plans Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan have various benefit plans. For additional information on our U.S. and Japanese plans, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Policyholder Protection Corporation The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. On December 12, 2008, legislation was enacted extending the framework of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC), which included government fiscal measures supporting the LIPPC through March 2012. On October 10, 2008, a small life insurance company, Yamato Life Insurance filed for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy may result in additional assessments to the industry. Although the likelihood and timing of any future assessments cannot be determined at this time, we believe the bankruptcy will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Hedging Activities Aflac has limited hedging activities. Our primary exposure to be hedged is our investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. First, Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar 85 Table of Contents denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. Second, we have designated the Parent Companys yen denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes payable and cross currency swaps) as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the total of these yen denominated liabilities is equal to or less than our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective and the related exchange effect is reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. Should these yen denominated liabilities exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, the portion of the hedge that exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan would be deemed ineffective. As required by SFAS 133, we would then recognize the foreign exchange effect on the ineffective portion in net earnings (other income). We estimate that if the ineffective portion was 10 billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every one yen weakening/strengthening in the end of period yen/dollar exchange rate. At December 31, 2008, our hedge was effective with yen denominated assets exceeding yen denominated liabilities by 59.6 billion yen, compared with 105.2 billion yen at December 31, 2007. The decrease in our yen denominated net asset position resulted from the continuing decline in the market value of our yen denominated available for sale investment securities as a result of widening credit spreads globally. We have interest rate swap agreements related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes. By entering into these contracts, we have been able to lock in our interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. SFAS 133 requires that the change in the fair value of the swap contracts be recorded in other comprehensive income so long as the hedge is deemed effective. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in net earnings (other income). These hedges were effective during the three year period ended December 31, 2008; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2008, we had no material unconditional purchase obligations that were not recorded on the balance sheet. Additionally, we had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. 86 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent Company through dividends and management fees. The following presents the amounts provided for the years ended December 31: Liquidity Provided by Aflac to Parent Company (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Dividends declared or paid by Aflac $ 1,062 $ 1,362 $ 665 Management fees paid by Aflac 71 80 68 The primary uses of cash by the Parent Company were shareholder dividends, the repurchase of its common shares and interest on its outstanding indebtedness. The Parent Companys sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not expected to change materially in the future. For additional information, see the Financing Activities section of this MDA. The principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income. The primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are policy claims, commissions, operating expenses, income taxes and payments to the Parent Company for management fees and dividends. Both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable. When making an investment decision, our first consideration is based on product needs. Our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment grade debt securities. These objectives also take into account duration matching, and because of the long term nature of our business, we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs. As a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. Therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. We expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses. 87 Table of Contents The following table presents the estimated payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008. We translated our yen denominated obligations using the December 31, 2008, exchange rate. Actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.

The distribution of payments for future policy benefits is an estimate of all future benefit payments for policies in force as of December 31, 2008. These projected values contain assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality and morbidity. The distribution of payments for unpaid policy claims includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. Actual amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above. We anticipate that the future policy benefit liability of $59.3 billion at December 31, 2008, along with future net premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund future policy benefit payments. The distribution of payments due in less than one year for long term debt consists of $450 million for our senior notes that are due in April 2009. We plan to either refinance, subject to market conditions, or use existing cash to pay off the aforementioned senior notes. The cross currency interest rate swaps related to our senior notes will expire in April 2009 and as of December 31, 2008, would have required a payment of $155 million to the swap counterparties. See Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 88 Table of Contents Consolidated Cash Flows We translate cash flows for Aflac Japans yen denominated items into U.S. dollars using weighted average exchange rates. In years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. The following table summarizes consolidated cash flows by activity for the years ended December 31. Consolidated Cash Flows by Activity (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Operating activities $ 4,965 $ 4,656 $ 4,397 Investing activities (4,283 ) (3,654 ) (4,057 ) Financing activities (1,383 ) (655 ) (434 ) Exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents 79 13 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (622 ) $ 360 $ (94 ) Operating Activities The following table summarizes operating cash flows by source for the years ended December 31. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Aflac Japan $ 4,225 $ 3,573 $ 3,437 Aflac U.S. and other operations 740 1,083 960 Total $ 4,965 $ 4,656 $ 4,397 The increase in Aflac Japan operating cash flows during 2008 was due primarily to the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in Aflac U.S. operating cash flows was due primarily to increased U.S. federal tax payments. Cash tax payments increased in 2008 because we have fully utilized our remaining tax credit carryforwards. Cash provided by operating activities was also reduced by the payout of lump sum return of premium benefits to policyholders on a closed block of U.S. cancer insurance business. The majority of these benefit payouts began in 2008 and will conclude in 2012. We paid out $63 million in 2008, and we anticipate paying out an additional $360 million over the next four years. 89 Table of Contents Investing Activities Operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase debt securities to meet future policy obligations. The following table summarizes investing cash flows by source for the years ended December 31. Net Cash Used by Investing Activities (In millions) 2008 2007 2006 Aflac Japan $ (3,874 ) $ (3,231 ) $ (3,372 ) Aflac U.S. and other operations (409 ) (423 ) (685 ) Total $ (4,283 ) $ (3,654 ) $ (4,057 ) The increase in Aflac Japan cash used by investing activities during 2008 was due primarily to the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. Prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. Currently, when our debt and perpetual securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, the long term nature of our business and our strong cash flows provide us with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. When market opportunities arise, we dispose of selected debt and perpetual securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and or rebalance our portfolio. As a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year. Dispositions before maturity were approximately 4% of the annual average investment portfolio of debt and perpetual securities available for sale during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and 7% during the year ended December 31, 2006. Dispositions before maturity in 2006 were impacted by the bond swaps we executed in the first half of 2006. Financing Activities Consolidated cash used by financing activities was $1.4 billion in 2008, $655 million in 2007 and $434 million in 2006. In June 2007, we received $242 million in connection with the Parent Companys issuance of yen denominated Samurai notes, and we paid $242 million in connection with the maturity of the 2002 Samurai notes. In June 2006, the Parent Company paid $355 million in connection with the maturity of the 2001 Samurai notes. In September 2006, the Parent Company received $382 million from its issuance of yen denominated Uridashi notes. Cash returned to shareholders through treasury stock purchases and dividends was $1.9 billion in 2008, compared with $979 million in 2007 and $728 million in 2006. In April 2009, our $450 million senior notes will mature. We plan to either refinance, subject to market conditions, or use existing cash to pay off the aforementioned senior notes. We have no restrictive financial covenants related to our notes payable. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable at December 31, 2008. 90 Table of Contents The following tables present a summary of treasury stock activity during the years ended December 31.

The total 23.2 million shares comprised 12.5 million shares purchased through an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated (Merrill Lynch) and 10.7 million shares purchased through Goldman, Sachs Co. (GSCo.). On February 4, 2008, we entered into an agreement for an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program with Merrill Lynch. Under the agreement, we purchased 12.5 million shares of our outstanding common stock at $60.61 per share for an initial purchase price of $758 million. The shares were acquired as a part of previously announced share repurchase authorizations by our board of directors and are held in treasury. The ASR program was settled during the second quarter of 2008, resulting in a purchase price adjustment of $40 million, or $3.22 per share, paid to Merrill Lynch based upon the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the ASR program period. The total purchase price for the 12.5 million shares was $798 million, or $63.83 per share. On August 26, 2008, we entered into an agreement for a share repurchase program with GSCo. Under the agreement, which had an original termination date of February 18, 2009, we paid $825 million to GSCo. for the repurchase of a variable number of shares of our outstanding common stock over the stated contract period. On October 2, 2008, due to market conditions, we took early delivery of 10.7 million shares, which we hold in treasury, at a total purchase price of $683 million, or $63.87 per share. We also received unused funds of $142 million from GSCo. As of December 31, 2008, a remaining balance of 32.4 million shares were available for purchase; 2.4 million shares are the remainder from a board authorization in 2006 and 30.0 million shares were authorized by the board of directors for purchase in January 2008. We do not plan to purchase any shares of our common stock during the first half of 2009; however, we will evaluate the market and our capital position to determine if we will purchase any shares in the second half of the year. 91 Table of Contents Cash dividends paid in 2008 of $.96 per share increased 20.0% over 2007.

Regulatory Restrictions Aflac is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to its regulations. The Nebraska insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net gain from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. These regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by Aflac to the Parent Company. A life insurance companys statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the NAIC, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance companys state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from GAAP and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. The continued long term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations. Aflacs insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings. The NAICs risk based capital (RBC) formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. The RBC formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurers operations. Aflacs company action level RBC ratio was 476.5% as of December 31, 2008. Our RBC ratio remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. As of December 31, 2008, our total adjusted capital exceeded the amounts to achieve a company action level RBC of 400% and 350% by $742 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. We consider these amounts to be excess capital. Currently, the NAIC has ongoing regulatory initiatives relating to revisions to the RBC formula as well as numerous initiatives covering insurance products, investments, and other actuarial and accounting matters. In addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by U.S. insurance regulators, Japans FSA may not allow profit repatriations or other transfers from Aflac Japan if they would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders. The FSA maintains its own solvency standard. As of December 31, 2008, Aflac Japans solvency margin ratio was 880.5%, which significantly exceeds regulatory minimums. 92 Table of Contents Payments are made from Aflac Japan to the Parent Company for management fees and to Aflac U.S. for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings.
