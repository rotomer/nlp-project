ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those informational statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements. We desire to take advantage of these provisions. This report contains cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected herein, and in any other statements made by Company officials in communications with the financial community and contained in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Forward looking statements are not based on historical information and relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Furthermore, forward looking information is subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements containing words such as expect, anticipate, believe, goal, objective, may, should, estimate, intends, projects, will, assumes, potential, target or similar words as well as specific projections of future results, generally qualify as forward looking. Aflac undertakes no obligation to update such forward looking statements. We caution readers that the following factors, in addition to other factors mentioned from time to time, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements: difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets defaults and downgrades in certain securities in our investment portfolio impairment of financial institutions credit and other risks associated with Aflacs investment in perpetual securities differing judgments applied to investment valuations subjective determinations of amount of impairments taken on our investments limited availability of acceptable yen denominated investments concentration of our investments in any particular sector concentration of business in Japan ongoing changes in our industry exposure to significant financial and capital markets risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates significant changes in investment yield rates deviations in actual experience from pricing and reserving assumptions subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to the Parent Company changes in law or regulation by governmental authorities ability to attract and retain qualified sales associates and employees decreases in our financial strength or debt ratings ability to continue to develop and implement improvements in information technology systems changes in U.S. and or Japanese accounting standards failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security level and outcome of litigation ability to effectively manage key executive succession catastrophic events failure of internal controls or corporate governance policies and procedures 36 Table of Contents MD&A OVERVIEW Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of Aflac Incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three year period ended December 31, 2009. As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes. This MD&A is divided into the following sections: Our Business 2009 Performance Highlights Critical Accounting Estimates Results of Operations, consolidated and by segment Analysis of Financial Condition, including discussion of market risks of financial instruments Capital Resources and Liquidity, including discussion of availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash OUR BUSINESS Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Companys insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Additionally, Aflac U.S. markets and administers group products through Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC). Most of Aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Parent Company closed its $100 million purchase of Continental American Insurance Group, Inc. (CAIG), which includes its wholly owned subsidiary CAIC. Subsequent to the closing, CAIG merged into Continental American Group, LLC, a limited liability company wholly owned by CAIC. As a result of the merger, CAIC became directly wholly owned by the Parent Company. CAIC is headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina, and equips Aflac U.S. with a platform for offering attractive voluntary group insurance products that are well suited for distribution by insurance brokers at the worksite. The purchase business combination resulted in the recognition of $97 million of net assets at fair value. An immaterial amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, was recognized as part of the business combination. 2009 PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS Results for 2009 benefited from the stronger yen. Total revenues rose 10.3% to $18.3 billion, compared with $16.6 billion a year ago. Net earnings were $1.5 billion, or $3.19 per diluted share, compared with $1.3 billion, or $2.62 per share, in 2008. We experienced net realized investment losses of $1.2 billion in 2009, which included the recognition of other than temporary impairments of $1.4 billion. During 2009, we had a $1.0 billion decrease in gross unrealized losses on our available for sale debt and perpetual securities due to the recognition of impairment losses and improved fair values for many categories of investment securities. In 2009, we borrowed a total of $1.4 billion, consisting of $1.3 billon in dollar denominated senior notes raised through U.S. public debt offerings and loans totaling 15 billion yen. We used $450 million of this capital to redeem our senior notes that were due in 2009, and we plan to use some of this capital to redeem our yen denominated Samurai notes due July 2010, a liability of $428 million using the December 31, 2009 exchange rate. We have suspended stock repurchase activity in the open market. The raising of capital and suspension of stock repurchase activity have had a favorable impact on our capital position. 37 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). References to GAAP issued by the FASB in this MD&A are to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of Aflacs results of operations and financial condition are those related to the valuation of investments, deferred policy acquisition costs, liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, and income taxes. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from managements analyses and judgments. The application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 94% of our assets and 88% of our liabilities are reported as of December 31, 2009, and thus has a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders equity. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results. Investments Aflacs investments in debt, perpetual and equity securities include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For privately issued securities, we receive pricing data from external sources that take into account each securitys credit quality and liquidity characteristics. We also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. These reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The identification of distressed investments, the determination of fair value if not publicly traded, and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require evaluation of factors, including but not limited to: issuer financial condition, including profitability and cash flows credit status of the issuer the issuers specific and general competitive environment published reports general economic environment regulatory, legislative and political environment the severity of the decline in fair value the length of time the fair value is below cost our intent, need, or both to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery in value other factors as may become available from time to time See Notes 1, 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Policy Liabilities Aflacs products are generally long duration fixed benefit indemnity contracts. We make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business to match expected policy benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with expected policy premiums. These assumptions include persistency, morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses. If actual results match the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs, profits will emerge as a level percentage of earned premiums. However, because actual results will vary from the assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary from year to year. We measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business. Our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our DAC is recoverable. 38 Table of Contents Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policys premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income. Future amortization of DAC is based upon our estimates of persistency, interest and future premium revenue generally established at the time of policy issuance. However, the unamortized balance of DAC reflects actual persistency. As presented in the following table, the ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force increased slightly for Aflac U.S. in 2009 and 2008, compared with prior years. This increase was primarily driven by the introduction of an accelerated commission payment option for new associates and the refinement of our first year commission deferrals on certain products. The ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has shown a slight upward trend for Aflac Japan for the last three years. This trend is a result of a greater proportion of our annualized premiums being under the alternative commission schedule, which pays a higher commission on first year premiums and lower commissions on renewal premiums. This schedule is very popular with our new agents as it helps them with cash flow for personal and business needs as they build their business. While this has resulted in a higher unamortized DAC balance, the overall cost to the Company has been reduced. Deferred Policy Acquisition Cost Ratios Aflac Japan Aflac U.S. (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Deferred policy acquisition costs $ 5,846 $ 5,644 $ 4,269 $ 2,687 $ 2,593 $ 2,385 Annualized premiums in force 13,034 12,761 9,860 4,956 4,789 4,510 Deferred policy acquisition costs as a percentage of annualized premiums in force 44.9 % 44.2 % 43.3 % 54.2 % 54.1 % 52.9 % Policy Liabilities The following table provides details of policy liabilities by segment and in total as of December 31. Policy Liabilities (In millions) 2009 2008 U.S. segment: Future policy benefits $ 5,779 $ 5,442 Unpaid policy claims 1,023 933 Other policy liabilities 385 375 Total U.S. policy liabilities $ 7,187 $ 6,750 Japan segment: Future policy benefits $ 55,720 $ 53,866 Unpaid policy claims 2,246 2,184 Other policy liabilities 4,089 3,416 Total Japan policy liabilities $ 62,055 $ 59,466 Consolidated: Future policy benefits $ 61,501 $ 59,310 Unpaid policy claims 3,270 3,118 Other policy liabilities 4,474 3,791 Total consolidated policy liabilities $ 69,245 $ 66,219 39 Table of Contents Our policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with applicable guidelines as defined under GAAP and Actuarial Standards of Practice, include two primary components: future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 89% and 5% of total policy liabilities as of December 31, 2009, respectively. Future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. We calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. These assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued. The assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. As required by GAAP, we also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience. Unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us. We compute unpaid policy claims on a non discounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. We update the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability. Our insurance products provide fixed benefit amounts per occurrence that are not subject to medical cost inflation. Furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the United States and Japan. This geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. Claims incurred under Aflacs policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. The unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. Severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. Our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders. As a part of our established financial reporting and accounting practices and controls, we perform actuarial reviews of our policyholder liabilities on an ongoing basis and reflect the results of those reviews in our results of operations and financial condition as required by GAAP. In computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. We monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. Claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. In calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, we do not calculate a range of estimates. The following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of December 31, 2009, to changes in severity and frequency of claims. For the years 2007 through 2009, our assumptions changed on average by approximately 1% in total, and we believe that a variation in assumptions in a range of plus or minus 1% in total is reasonably likely to occur. 40 Table of Contents Sensitivity of Unpaid Policy Claims Liability (In millions) Total Severity Total Frequency Decreaseby 2% Decreaseby 1% Unchanged Increaseby 1% Increaseby 2% Increase by 2% $ $ 22 $ 44 $ 66 $ 88 Increase by 1% (21 ) 22 44 66 Unchanged (43 ) (22 ) 22 44 Decrease by 1% (64 ) (43 ) (22 ) 22 Decrease by 2% (85 ) (64 ) (43 ) (21 ) The table below reflects the growth of future policy benefits liability for the years ended December 31. Future Policy Benefits (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2009 2008 2007 Aflac U.S. $ 5,779 $ 5,442 $ 4,958 Growth rate 6.2 % 9.8 % 12.9 % Aflac Japan $ 55,720 $ 53,866 $ 40,715 Growth rate 3.4 % 32.3 % 11.7 % Consolidated $ 61,501 $ 59,310 $ 45,675 Growth rate 3.7 % 29.9 % 11.8 % Yen/dollar exchange rate (end of period) 92.10 91.03 114.15 Aflac Japan (in yen) 5,132 4,903 4,648 Growth rate 4.7 % 5.5 % 7.1 % The growth of the future policy benefits liability in dollars has been primarily due to the aging of our in force block of business and the addition of new business in Japan. This growth in dollars was offset in 2009 by the weakening of the yen against the U.S. dollar, however it was enhanced by the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar in 2008 and 2007. Income Taxes Income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing our income tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with GAAP is a two step process. Under the first step, the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The second step is measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. New Accounting Pronouncements During the last three years, various accounting standard setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. For information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table is a presentation of items impacting net earnings and net earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31. Items Impacting Net Earnings In Millions Per Diluted Share 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Net earnings $ 1,497 $ 1,254 $ 1,634 $ 3.19 $ 2.62 $ 3.31 Items impacting net earnings, net of tax: Realized investment gains (losses) (788 ) (655 ) 19 (1.67 ) (1.37 ) .04 Impact from ASC 815 (3 ) (3 ) 2 (.01 ) Gain on extinguishment of debt 11 .02 Realized Investment Gains and Losses Our investment strategy is to invest in investment grade fixed income securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the Companys profitability. This investment strategy aligns our assets with our liability structure, which our assets support. We do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and or general portfolio maintenance and rebalancing. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the principal drivers of our profitability. In 2009, we realized pretax investment losses of $1,361 million ($884 million after tax) as a result of the recognition of other than temporary impairment losses. We realized pretax investment losses of $101 million ($66 million after tax) from the exchange of two of our Lloyds Banking Group plc perpetual security investments. We exchanged our investment in Lloyds TSB Bank plc yen denominated, Upper Tier II perpetual securities into yen denominated, Lower Tier II fixed maturity securities. We also exchanged our holdings of Bank of Scotland plc yen denominated, Upper Tier II perpetual securities into yen denominated, Lower Tier II fixed maturity securities. The losses were partially offset by pretax investment gains of $250 million ($162 million after tax) that were generated primarily from a bond swap program that took advantage of tax loss carryforwards. In 2008, we realized pretax investment losses of $753 million ($489 million after tax) as a result of the recognition of other than temporary impairment losses. We realized pretax investment losses, net of gains, of $254 million ($166 million after tax) from securities sold or redeemed in the normal course of business. In 2007, we realized pretax investment losses of $23 million ($15 million after tax) as a result of the recognition of other than temporary impairment losses. We realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $51 million ($34 million after tax) from securities sold or redeemed in the normal course of business. 42 Table of Contents The following table details our pretax impairment losses by category for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Perpetual securities $ 729 $ 379 $ Corporate bonds 458 160 20 Collateralized debt obligations 148 213 Collateralized mortgage obligations 24 2 Equity securities 2 1 1 Total other than temporary impairments $ 1,361 $ 753 $ 23 For additional information regarding realized investment gains and losses, please see Notes 1, 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impact from ASC 815 (formerly SFAS 133) We had cross currency interest rate swap agreements that economically converted our dollar denominated senior notes, which matured in April 2009, into a yen denominated obligation. Until April 2009, we designated the foreign currency component of these cross currency swaps as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our investment in Aflac Japan. The effect of issuing fixed rate, dollar denominated debt and swapping it into fixed rate, yen denominated debt had the same economic impact on Aflac as if we had issued yen denominated debt of a like amount. However, the accounting treatment for cross currency swaps is different from issuing yen denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes. ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, requires that the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of the cross currency swaps, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, be reflected in net earnings. This change in fair value was determined by relative dollar and yen interest rates and had no cash impact on our results of operations. At maturity, the fair value equaled initial contract fair value, and the cumulative impact of gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the interest component was zero. We demonstrated the ability and intent to retain the cross currency swaps until they expired in April 2009. The impact from ASC 815 includes the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross currency swaps, which did not qualify for hedge accounting, and is included in other income. We have issued yen denominated Samurai and Uridashi notes and have entered into two yen denominated loans. We have designated these notes and loans as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. If the value of these yen denominated notes exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan, we would be required to recognize the foreign currency effect on the excess in net earnings (other income). The foreign currency gain or loss on the excess liabilities would be included in the impact from ASC 815. When we made our hedge designations at the beginning of the second quarter of 2009, the notional amount of our yen denominated liabilities exceeded our yen net asset position in Aflac Japan. Therefore, we de designated this excess portion of our yen denominated liabilities from our net investment hedge. An immaterial loss was recorded in net earnings (other income) and included in the impact from ASC 815 during the quarter ended June 30, 2009, as a result of the negative foreign currency effect on the portion of our yen denominated liabilities that was not designated as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. When we reassessed our hedge designations at the beginning of the third and fourth quarters of 2009, our yen net asset position in Aflac Japan exceeded our total yen denominated liabilities; therefore, all of these liabilities were designated as a hedge of our net investment in Aflac Japan, resulting in no impact on net earnings during the third and fourth quarters of 2009. Our net investment hedge was effective during the years ended December 31, 2008, and 2007; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings during those periods. We have interest rate swap agreements related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes and have designated the swap agreements as a hedge of the variability of the debt cash flows. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest 43 Table of Contents rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. GAAP requires that the change in the fair value of the swap contracts be recorded in other comprehensive income so long as the hedge is deemed effective. Any ineffectiveness would be recognized in net earnings (other income) and would be included in the impact from ASC 815. These hedges were effective during the three year period ended December 31, 2009; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings. See Notes 1, 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Debt Extinguishment During the first six months of 2009, we extinguished portions of our yen denominated Uridashi and Samurai debt by buying the notes on the open market. We realized a total gain from extinguishment of debt of 1.6 billion yen, or $17 million ($11 million after tax), which we included in other income. We did not extinguish any debt during the second half of 2009. Foreign Currency Translation Aflac Japans premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen denominated assets to support yen denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. We translate Aflac Japans yen denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its yen denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our Company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, management evaluates Aflacs financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Income Taxes Our combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was 33.0% in 2009, 34.5% in 2008 and 34.6% in 2007. The effective tax rate declined in 2009 due primarily to the settlement of an examination by the Internal Revenue Service that reduced the ASC 740 tax liability by $24 million. Total income taxes were $738 million in 2009, compared with $660 million in 2008 and $865 million in 2007. Japanese income taxes on Aflac Japans results account for most of our consolidated income tax expense. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Earnings Guidance We communicate earnings guidance in this report based on the growth in net earnings per diluted share. However, certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of managements control may have a significant impact on actual results. Therefore, our comparison of net earnings includes certain assumptions to reflect the limitations that are inherent in projections of net earnings. In comparing period over period results, we exclude the effect of realized investment gains and losses, the impact from ASC 815 and nonrecurring items. We also assume no impact from foreign currency translation on the Aflac Japan segment and the Parent Companys yen denominated interest expense for a given year in relation to the prior year. 44 Table of Contents Subject to the preceding assumptions, our objective for 2009 was to increase net earnings per diluted share by 13% to 15% over 2008. We reported 2009 net earnings per diluted share of $3.19. Adjusting that number for realized investment losses ($1.67 per diluted share), the impact from ASC 815 (a loss of $.01 per diluted share), gain on extinguishment of debt ($.02 per diluted share), and foreign currency translation (a gain of $.26 per diluted share), we met our objective for the year. Our objective for 2010 is to increase net earnings per diluted share by 9% to 12% over 2009, on the basis described above. If we achieve this objective, the following table shows the likely results for 2010 net earnings per diluted share, including the impact of foreign currency translation using various yen/dollar exchange rate scenarios. 2010 Net Earnings Per Share (EPS) Scenarios* Weighted AverageYen/DollarExchange Rate Net Earnings PerDiluted Share % GrowthOver 2009 Yen Impacton EPS 85.00 $ 5.61 5.76 15.7 18.8 % $ .33 90.00 5.41 5.56 11.5 14.6 .13 93.49** 5.29 5.43 9.1 12.0 95.00 5.24 5.38 8.0 10.9 (.05 ) 100.00 5.08 5.22 4.7 7.6 (.21 ) * Excludes realized investment gains/losses, impact from ASC 815 and nonrecurring items in 2010 and 2009 ** Actual 2009 weighted average exchange rate INSURANCE OPERATIONS Aflacs insurance business consists of two segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. Aflac Japan, which operates as a branch of Aflac, is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. GAAP financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual financial statements. Furthermore, we are required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets. We measure and evaluate our insurance segments financial performance using operating earnings on a pretax basis. We define segment operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from ASC 815, and nonrecurring items. We believe that an analysis of segment pretax operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is conducted in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars. We evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales, an industry operating measure. Total new annualized premium sales, which include new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, represent the premiums that we would collect over a 12 month period, assuming the policies remain in force. For Aflac Japan, total new annualized premium sales are determined by applications submitted during the reporting period. For Aflac U.S., total new annualized premium sales are determined by applications that are accepted during the reporting period. Premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period. 45 Table of Contents AFLAC JAPAN SEGMENT Aflac Japan Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac Japans pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac Japan for the years ended December 31. Aflac Japan Summary of Operating Results (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Premium income $ 12,178 $ 10,674 $ 9,037 Net investment income: Yen denominated investment income 1,510 1,312 1,102 Dollar denominated investment income 755 741 699 Net investment income 2,265 2,053 1,801 Other income 43 15 27 Total operating revenues 14,486 12,742 10,865 Benefits and claims 8,746 7,972 6,935 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 523 405 318 Insurance commissions 1,060 970 850 Insurance and other expenses 1,357 1,145 941 Total operating expenses 2,940 2,520 2,109 Total benefits and expenses 11,686 10,492 9,044 Pretax operating earnings* $ 2,800 $ 2,250 $ 1,821 Weighted average yen/dollar exchange rate 93.49 103.46 117.93 In Dollars In Yen Percentage change over previous year: 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Premium income 14.1 % 18.1 % 3.1 % 3.3 % 3.5 % 4.3 % Net investment income 10.3 14.0 6.7 (.1 ) 8.0 Total operating revenues 13.7 17.3 3.7 3.0 2.8 4.9 Pretax operating earnings* 24.4 23.6 10.2 12.4 8.4 11.8 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings. The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of 3.3% in 2009, 3.2% in 2008 and 3.9% in 2007 reflect the high persistency of Aflac Japans business and the sales of new policies. Annualized premiums in force at December 31, 2009, were 1.20 trillion yen, compared with 1.16 trillion yen in 2008 and 1.13 trillion yen in 2007. Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year end exchange rates, were $13.0 billion in 2009, $12.8 billion in 2008, and $9.9 billion in 2007. Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar denominated and reverse dual currency securities (yen denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). Dollar denominated investment income from these assets accounted for approximately 33% of Aflac Japans investment income in 2009, compared with 36% in 2008 and 39% in 2007. In years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating Aflac Japans dollar denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen weakens, translating dollar denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. On a constant 46 Table of Contents currency basis, dollar denominated investment income accounted for approximately 36% of Aflac Japans investment income during 2009, compared with 39% in 2008 and 2007. The following table illustrates the effect of translating Aflac Japans dollar denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year. Aflac Japan Percentage Changes Over Prior Year (Yen Operating Results) Including ForeignCurrency Changes Excluding ForeignCurrency Changes** 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Net investment income (.1 )% % 8.0 % 3.4 % 5.0 % 7.4 % Total operating revenues 3.0 2.8 4.9 3.5 3.8 4.9 Pretax operating earnings* 12.4 8.4 11.8 15.1 13.8 11.3 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings. ** Amounts excluding foreign currency changes on dollar denominated items were determined using the same yen/dollar exchange rate for the current year as each respective prior year. The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac Japan for the years ended December 31. Ratios to total revenues: 2009 2008 2007 Benefits and claims 60.4 % 62.5 % 63.8 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 3.6 3.2 2.9 Insurance commissions 7.3 7.6 7.8 Insurance and other expenses 9.4 9.0 8.7 Total operating expenses 20.3 19.8 19.4 Pretax operating earnings* 19.3 17.7 16.8 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings. The benefit ratio has declined over the past several years, reflecting the impact of newer products and riders with lower loss ratios. We have also experienced favorable claim trends in our major product lines. We expect the improvement in the benefit ratio to continue as we shift to newer products and riders and benefit from the impact of favorable claim trends. However, this improvement is partially offset by the effect of low investment yields, which impacts our profit margin by reducing the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves (see table and discussion in the Interest Rate Risk section of this MD&A). The operating expense ratio increased slightly in 2009 in line with our expectations. We expect the operating expense ratio to remain relatively stable in 2010. The pretax operating profit margin expanded in 2009 primarily due to continued improvement in the benefit ratio. We expect this improvement to continue, resulting in continued expansion in the profit margin in 2010. Aflac Japan Sales Our stated objective for 2009 was for sales to be flat to up 5%. We exceeded our objective with a 6.7% increase in sales during 2009. The following table presents Aflac Japans total new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31. In Dollars In Yen (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Total new annualized premium sales $ 1,310 $ 1,115 $ 974 122.3 114.7 114.6 Increase (decrease) over prior year 17.5 % 14.4 % (3.5 )% 6.7 % % (2.4 )% 47 Table of Contents The following table details the contributions to total new annualized premium sales by major insurance product for the years ended December 31. 2009 2008 2007 Medical 36 % 34 % 33 % Cancer 28 34 33 Ordinary life 29 23 22 Rider MAX 3 5 7 Other 4 4 5 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Medical insurance sales increased 15.7% over 2008. Since first launching our stand alone medical product, EVER, in 2002, we have been the number one seller of medical insurance policies in Japan. In the past six years, we have segmented the market by creating a suite of EVER products with variations that appeal to specific Japanese consumers. In August 2009, we introduced a new generation of our popular EVER product, the most notable changes being an enhanced surgical benefit and gender specific premium rates. Overall, the profitability of the new plan is similar to our original EVER product. We have had a positive initial response to our revised EVER product, selling more than 346,800 of the revised policies since it was introduced. With continued cost pressure on Japans health care system, we expect the need for medical products will continue to rise in the future, and we remain encouraged about the outlook for the medical insurance market. Cancer insurance sales declined 11.3% in 2009, compared with 2008. Despite this decrease, Aflac remained the number one seller of cancer insurance policies in Japan. Our cancer policies are also marketed through a strategic alliance with Dai ichi Mutual Life. In 2009, Dai ichi Life sold more than 122,000 of our market leading cancer policies. We are convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio. Sales of cancer and medical insurance in Japan have benefited from the bank channel. In December 2007, banks were permitted to sell supplemental health insurance products to their customers. Our bank channel sales increased 132.2% during 2009, compared with 2008, and represented 6% of total new sales. By the end of 2009, we had agreements with 353 banks to sell our products. We have significantly more selling agreements with banks than any of our competitors in Japan. We believe our long standing and strong relationships within the Japanese banking sector, along with our strategic preparations, have proven to be an advantage as this channel opened up for our products. Ordinary life product sales increased 33.9% during 2009, compared with 2008. The increase in our ordinary life products was driven by a favorable consumer response to our child endowment product that we introduced at the end of first quarter 2009. Our child endowment product is appropriate for new parents who are re evaluating their insurance coverage. This product offers a death benefit until the child reaches age 18, and it pays a lump sum benefit at the time of the childs entry into high school as well as an educational annuity for each of the four years during his or her college education. We believe that traditional life insurance products, like our child endowment plan, provide opportunities for us to sell our third sector cancer and medical products. For every 10 child endowment plans that were purchased in 2009, we sold two additional Aflac products to the same customers. We remain committed to selling through our traditional channels, which allows us to reach consumers through affiliated corporate agencies, independent corporate agencies and individual agencies. In 2009, we recruited approximately 4,600 new sales agencies, an increase of 17.9% over 2008. At the end of the year, Aflac Japan was represented by more than 19,600 sales agencies, or more than 110,500 licensed sales associates employed by those agencies. 48 Table of Contents We believe that there is still a strong need for our products in Japan. Our objective for 2010 is for total new annualized premium sales to be flat to up 5% in Japan. Aflac Japan Investments Growth of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, and the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on dollar denominated investment income. Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than those available on Japanese government or other public corporate bonds, while still adhering to prudent standards for credit quality. All of our privately issued securities are rated investment grade at the time of purchase. These securities are generally issued with documentation consistent with standard medium term note programs. In addition, many of these investments have protective covenants appropriate to the specific issuer, industry and country. These covenants often require the issuer to adhere to specific financial ratios and give priority to repayment of our investment under certain circumstances. The following table presents the results of Aflac Japans investment activities for the years ended December 31. 2009 2008 2007 New money yield yen only 2.80 % 3.20 % 3.05 % New money yield blended 3.03 3.43 3.38 Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 3.65 3.82 4.06 At December 31, 2009, the yield on Aflac Japans investment portfolio, including dollar denominated investments, was 3.77%, compared with 3.90% a year ago. The overall credit quality of Aflac Japans investments remained high. At the end of 2009, 93.4% of Aflac Japans debt and perpetual securities were rated investment grade, on an amortized cost basis. See the Credit Risk section of this MD&A for additional information. Japanese Economy The Bank of Japans January 2010 Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments stated that Japans economic conditions have improved due to various policy measures taken in Japan and abroad. Exports and production have been increasing, and private consumption is increasing despite the depressed employment and income situation. The report projected that Japans economic conditions are expected to continue to improve at a moderate pace. Japans system of compulsory public health care insurance provides medical coverage to every Japanese citizen. These public medical expenditures are covered by a combination of premiums paid by insureds and their employers, taxes and copayments from the people who receive medical service. However, given Japans aging population, the resources available to these publicly funded social insurance programs have come under increasing pressure. As a result, copayments and other out of pocket expenses have been rising and affecting more people. We believe higher out of pocket expenses will lead consumers to purchase more supplemental medical insurance. Many insurance companies have recognized the opportunities for selling supplemental medical insurance in Japan and have launched new products in recent years. However, we believe our favorable cost structure compared with other insurers makes us a very effective competitor. In addition, we believe our brand, customer service and financial strength also benefit our market position. 49 Table of Contents Japanese Regulatory Environment We expect that our distribution system will continue to evolve in Japan. Regulatory changes that took effect in December 2007 enable banks to sell our third sector products to their customers. Our strong brand as the leading seller of cancer and medical insurance products in Japan and our many long term relationships within the Japanese banking sector place us in a strong position to sell through this new channel. By the end of 2009, we had agreements with 353 banks to market Aflacs products. The FSA maintains a solvency standard, which is used by Japanese regulators to monitor the financial strength of insurance companies. As of December 31, 2009, Aflac Japans solvency margin ratio was 885.5%, which significantly exceeds regulatory minimums. The FSA has issued a proposal to revise the current method of calculating the solvency margin ratio. The FSA intends to apply the revised method to life insurance companies for the fiscal year end 2011 (March 31, 2012) and require the disclosure of the ratio as reference information for fiscal year end 2010 (March 31, 2011). The FSA expects the revision would generally reduce life insurance companies solvency margin ratios to approximately half the level of those reported under the current calculation method. We do not expect our relative position within the industry to materially change. AFLAC U.S. SEGMENT Aflac U.S. Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac U.S. pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac U.S. for the years ended December 31. Aflac U.S. Summary of Operating Results (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Premium income $ 4,444 $ 4,272 $ 3,936 Net investment income 499 505 500 Other income 10 10 10 Total operating revenues 4,953 4,787 4,446 Benefits and claims 2,561 2,527 2,350 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 419 370 323 Insurance commissions 508 488 481 Insurance and other expenses 689 657 600 Total operating expenses 1,616 1,515 1,404 Total benefits and expenses 4,177 4,042 3,754 Pretax operating earnings* $ 776 $ 745 $ 692 Percentage change over previous year: Premium income 4.0 % 8.5 % 10.8 % Net investment income (1.1 ) .9 7.5 Total operating revenues 3.5 7.7 10.4 Pretax operating earnings* 4.1 7.6 18.3 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings. Annualized premiums in force increased 3.5% in 2009, 6.2% in 2008 and 10.0% in 2007. Annualized premiums in force at December 31 were $5.0 billion in 2009, compared with $4.8 billion in 2008 and $4.5 billion in 2007. Net investment income was relatively flat during 2009, due to the lack of growth in the 50 Table of Contents investment portfolio primarily as a result of excess capital used in our share purchase program during 2008. For further information, see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of this MD&A and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac U.S. for the years ended December 31. Ratios to total revenues: 2009 2008 2007 Benefits and claims 51.7 % 52.8 % 52.9 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 8.5 7.7 7.3 Insurance commissions 10.3 10.2 10.8 Insurance and other expenses 13.8 13.7 13.4 Total operating expenses 32.6 31.6 31.5 Pretax operating earnings* 15.7 15.6 15.6 * See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings. The benefit ratio declined and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased in 2009, compared with 2008, due to lower persistency levels. We expect the benefit and operating expense ratios to decline and the pretax operating profit margin to increase in 2010. Aflac U.S. Sales Weak economic conditions in 2009 continued to challenge Aflacs sales results in the United States. The following table presents Aflacs U.S. total new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Total new annualized premium sales $ 1,453 $ 1,551 $ 1,558 Increase (decrease) over prior year (6.4 )% (.4 )% 9.5 % The following table details the contributions to total new annualized premium sales by major insurance product category for the years ended December 31. 2009 2008 2007 Accident/disability 48 % 49 % 51 % Cancer 18 19 18 Hospital indemnity 18 16 14 Life 6 6 5 Fixed benefit dental 5 5 6 Other 5 5 6 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Total new annualized premium sales for accident/disability insurance, our leading product category, decreased 9.0%, cancer indemnity insurance sales decreased 11.3% and hospital indemnity insurance sales increased 1.7% in 2009, compared with 2008. We continued to enhance our product line in 2009 by launching Essentials Accident and Essentials Maximum Difference&reg; cancer plans. These new products have been streamlined with lower benefit and premium levels than the traditional cancer and accident insurance policies. In the short term, we believe they are better suited to the current economy and, in the long run, they will give consumers more choices. 51 Table of Contents Another aspect of our U.S. sales strategy is our focus on growing and improving our U.S. sales force. We remain satisfied with our progress in the ongoing expansion of our U.S. sales force. We recruited more than 28,400 new sales associates in 2009, a 10.6% increase compared with 2008, resulting in more than 75,300 licensed sales associates at December 31, 2009. Newly established payroll accounts were 10.6% higher in 2009, compared with 2008, suggesting our brand message and business to business efforts are reaching employers across the country. The number of new average weekly producers, or those who are selling regularly in their first year, increased 6.2% during 2009, compared with a year ago. We believe strong increases in new recruits and new weekly producers, coupled with significant payroll account growth, will provide a solid foundation for future sales when the U.S. economy recovers. In the first quarter of 2009, we implemented our new Aflac for BrokersSM initiative. Insurance brokers have been a historically underleveraged sales channel for Aflac, and we believe we can establish relationships that will complement, not compete with, our traditional distribution system. We have assembled a management team experienced in broker sales, and we are supporting this initiative with streamlined products, targeted broker specific advertising campaigns, customized enrollment technology, and competitive compensation. Additionally, a new level of management was introduced in 2009 to deliver this initiative. Over 100 broker development coordinators have been hired to be single points of contact for brokers across the country. Broker development coordinators are responsible for building relationships with new brokers as well as strengthening relationships with our current brokers. These coordinators are assisted by a team of certified case managers whose role is to coordinate and manage the account enrollments for brokers. Furthering our initiatives in the broker arena, we purchased CAIC for $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The purchase was funded with internal capital. CAIC, which is headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina, equips us with a platform for offering attractive voluntary group insurance products that are well suited for distribution by insurance brokers at the worksite. CAIC is rated A (Excellent) by A.M. Best. We believe that CAIC has the potential to benefit us in the U.S. market by helping us meet the product requests and needs of our field force when they pursue larger payroll accounts. We expect 2010 to be a challenging year from a sales perspective and look for sales to again decline in the first half of the year, followed by modest sales increases in the second half of 2010. Aflac U.S. Investments The following table presents the results of Aflacs U.S. investment activities for the years ended December 31. 2009 2008 2007 New money yield 7.26 % 7.60 % 6.44 % Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 6.66 6.77 6.79 The decrease in the U.S. new money yield in 2009 reflects tightening credit spreads. At December 31, 2009, the portfolio yield on Aflacs U.S. portfolio was 7.17%, compared with 7.10% a year ago. During 2008, we purchased $200 million of variable interest rate collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that support $200 million of variable interest rate funding agreements issued by Aflac U.S. Because these CDOs do not support our core policyholder benefit obligations, the yield on these CDOs is not included in the Aflac U.S. portfolio yield or in the yields listed in the above table. The overall credit quality of Aflac U.S. investments remained high. At the end of 2009, 90.4% of Aflac U.S. debt and perpetual securities were rated investment grade, on an amortized cost basis. See the Credit Risk section of this MD&A for additional information. 52 Table of Contents See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Credit Risk section of this MD&A for additional information. U.S. Economy Operating in the U.S. economy continues to be challenging. The weak economic environment has likely had an impact on some of our policyholders, potential customers and sales associates. Although we believe that the weakened U.S. economy has been a contributing factor to slower sales growth, we also believe our products remain affordable to the average American consumer. We believe that consumers underlying need for our U.S. product line remains strong, and the United States remains a sizeable and attractive market for our products. U.S. Regulatory Environment U.S. Congressional leaders and the Obama administration have expressed their commitment to enacting major health reform legislation, and both the House and the Senate have adopted their versions of a health care reform bill. While it is not possible to predict with certainty what provisions may be in any final legislation, it is likely that such legislation, if adopted, will include major changes to the U.S. health care insurance marketplace. Some of the proposals currently under discussion address individual and employer mandates, health insurance exchanges, coverage and exclusions, and medical loss ratios. The legislation also may include changes in government reimbursements and subsidies for individuals and employers and alter federal and state regulation of health insurers. Given the substantial differences between the legislation passed by the House and Senate, the ongoing negotiations to reconcile the legislation and the fact that some key provisions will be general in nature and subject to future regulatory action, it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty what effect any legislation and future regulation, if adopted, will have on the Companys U.S. business. However, Japan has had a national health care system for many years, and Aflac Japan has successfully operated in such a regulated environment. OTHER OPERATIONS Corporate operating expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation, benefits and facilities expenses. Corporate expenses, excluding investment income, were $77 million in 2009, $61 million in 2008 and $56 million in 2007. The increase in expenses in 2009 was due primarily to an increase in realized foreign currency losses on yen cash held by the Parent Company and an increase in expense for our unfunded supplemental retirement plans. Investment income included in reported corporate expenses was $9 million in 2009, $20 million in 2008 and $31 million in 2007. ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations. The yen/dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen denominated balance sheet items to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The following table demonstrates the effect of the change in the yen/dollar exchange rate by comparing select balance sheet items as reported at December 31, 2009, with the amounts that would have been reported had the exchange rate remained unchanged from December 31, 2008. 53 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Exchange on Balance Sheet Items (In millions) AsReported ExchangeEffect Net ofExchange Effect Yen/dollar exchange rate* 92.10 91.03 Investments and cash $ 73,192 $ (714 ) $ 73,906 Deferred policy acquisition costs 8,533 (69 ) 8,602 Total assets 84,106 (799 ) 84,905 Policy liabilities 69,245 (729 ) 69,974 Total liabilities 75,689 (778 ) 76,467 * The exchange rate at December 31, 2009, was 92.10 yen to one dollar, or 1.2% weaker than the December 31, 2008, exchange rate of 91.03. Market Risks of Financial Instruments Our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while emphasizing liquidity, safety and quality. Our investment objective, subject to appropriate risk constraints, is to fund policyholder obligations and other liabilities in a manner that enhances shareholders equity. We seek to achieve this objective through a diversified portfolio of fixed income investments that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities it supports. Aflac invests primarily within the fixed income securities markets. The following table details investment securities by segment as of December 31. Investment Securities by Segment Aflac Japan Aflac U.S. (In millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 Securities available for sale, at fair value: Fixed maturities $ 29,952 $ 29,140 $ 6,712 * $ 5,772 * Perpetual securities 7,041 7,843 222 204 Equity securities 24 27 Total available for sale 37,017 37,010 6,934 5,976 Securities held to maturity, at amortized cost: Fixed maturities 26,487 24,236 200 200 Total held to maturity 26,487 24,236 200 200 Total investment securities $ 63,504 $ 61,246 $ 7,134 $ 6,176 * Excludes investment grade, available for sale fixed maturity securities held by the Parent Company of $117 in 2009 and $100 in 2008. Because we invest in fixed income securities, our financial instruments are exposed primarily to three types of market risks: currency risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Currency Risk The functional currency of Aflac Japans insurance operation is the Japanese yen. All of Aflac Japans premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as are most of its investment income and other expenses. Furthermore, most of Aflac Japans investments, cash and liabilities are yen denominated. 54 Table of Contents When yen denominated securities mature or are sold, the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen denominated securities. Aflac Japan holds these yen denominated assets to fund its yen denominated policy obligations. In addition, Aflac Incorporated has yen denominated debt obligations. Although we generally do not convert yen into dollars, we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of reverse dual currency securities (yen denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments), which exposes Aflac to changes in foreign exchange rates. This foreign currency effect is accounted for as a component of unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities in accumulated other comprehensive income. When the yen strengthens against the dollar, shareholders equity is negatively impacted and, conversely, when the yen weakens against the dollar, shareholders equity is positively impacted. Aflac Japan invests a portion of its assets in reverse dual currency securities to provide a higher yield than those available on Japanese government or other public corporate bonds, while still adhering to prudent standards of credit quality. The yen/dollar exchange rate would have to strengthen to approximately 55 before the yield on these instruments would equal that of a comparable yen denominated instrument. On a consolidated basis, we attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders equity to foreign currency translation fluctuations. We accomplish this by investing a portion of Aflac Japans investment portfolio in dollar denominated securities and by the Parent Companys issuance of yen denominated debt (for additional information, see the discussion under Hedging Activities as follows in this section of MD&A). As a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is reduced. The dollar values of our yen denominated net assets, which are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations for financial reporting purposes, are summarized as follows (translated at end of period exchange rates) for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 Aflac Japan yen denominated net assets $ 2,736 $ 2,528 Parent Company yen denominated net liabilities (962 ) (1,876 ) Consolidated yen denominated net assets (liabilities) subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations $ 1,774 $ 652 The increase in our yen denominated net asset position was due primarily to the redemption in 2009 of the Parent Companys $450 million senior notes (economically yen debt due to conversion using cross currency swaps) and the holding of 35.8 billion yen in cash by the Parent Company as of December 31, 2009, for the redemption of our yen denominated Samurai notes due July 2010. 55 Table of Contents The following table demonstrates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of our yen denominated assets and liabilities, and our consolidated yen denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of December 31.

This primarily occurs when we repatriate funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., which is generally done annually. The exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. A portion of the repatriation may be used to service Aflac Incorporateds yen denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars. Interest Rate Risk Our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt and perpetual securities. We use a modified duration analysis modeling approach, which measures price percentage volatility, to estimate the sensitivity of the fair values of our investments to interest rate changes on the debt and perpetual securities we own. For example, if the current duration of a debt security or perpetual security is 10, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. Likewise, the fair value of the debt security or perpetual security will decrease by approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. 56 Table of Contents The estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt and perpetual securities we own, notes payable, cross currency and interest rate swaps and our obligation to the Japanese policyholder protection corporation as of December 31 follows: Sensitivity of Fair Values of Financial Instruments to Interest Rate Changes 2009 2008 (In millions) FairValue +100BasisPoints FairValue +100BasisPoints Debt and perpetual securities: Fixed maturity securities: Yen denominated $ 51,989 $ 46,199 $ 49,047 $ 43,556 Dollar denominated 10,620 9,668 9,048 8,246 Perpetual securities: Yen denominated 6,990 6,376 7,804 7,103 Dollar denominated 273 251 244 225 Total debt and perpetual securities $ 69,872 $ 62,494 $ 66,143 $ 59,130 Notes payable* $ 2,683 $ 2,557 $ 1,713 $ 1,530 Cross currency** and interest rate swap liabilities $ 3 $ $ 158 $ 151 Japanese policyholder protection corporation $ 128 $ 128 $ 161 $ 161 * Excludes capitalized lease obligations ** Cross currency swaps expired in April 2009 and are therefore excluded from the 2009 column. There are various factors that affect the fair value of our investment in debt and perpetual securities. Included in those factors are changes in the prevailing interest rate environment. Changes in the interest rate environment directly affect the balance of unrealized gains or losses for a given period in relation to a prior period. Decreases in market yields generally improve the fair value of debt and perpetual securities while increases in market yields generally have a negative impact on the fair value of our debt and perpetual securities. However, we do not expect to realize a majority of any unrealized gains or losses because we have the intent and ability to hold such securities until a recovery of value, which may be maturity. For additional information on unrealized losses on debt and perpetual securities, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. The following table presents the approximate duration of Aflac Japans yen denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of December 31. (In years) 2009 2008 Yen denominated debt and perpetual securities 12 12 Policy benefits and related expenses to be paid in future years 14 14 Premiums to be received in future years on policies in force 10 10 The following table presents the approximate duration of Aflac U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of December 31.

Comparison of Interest Rates for Future Policy Benefits and Investment Yields (Net of Investment Expenses) 2009 2008 2007 U.S. Japan* U.S. Japan* U.S. Japan* Policies issued during year: Required interest on policy reserves 5.50 % 2.51 % 5.50 % 2.74 % 5.50 % 2.74 % New money yield on investments 7.22 2.88 7.56 3.27 6.40 3.11 Policies in force at year end: Required interest on policy reserves 6.06 4.47 6.12 4.55 6.20 4.63 Return on average invested assets 6.66 3.65 6.77 3.82 6.79 3.83 * Represents yen denominated investments for Aflac Japan that support policy obligations and therefore excludes Aflac Japans annuity products, and dollar denominated investments and related investment income We continue to monitor the spread between our new money yield and the required interest assumption for newly issued products in both the United States and Japan and will re evaluate those assumptions as necessary. Over the next two years, we have yen denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of Aflac Japans current net investment yield of 3.43%. These securities total $3.3 billion at amortized cost and have an average yield of 5.49%. Currently, when debt and perpetual securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, adding riders to our older policies has helped offset negative investment spreads on these policies. Overall, adequate profit margins exist in Aflac Japans aggregate block of business because of profits that have emerged from changes in the mix of business and favorable experience from mortality, morbidity and expenses. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements related to our 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes. These agreements effectively swap the variable interest rate Uridashi notes to fixed rate notes to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. For further information, see Notes 4 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Risk Our investment activities expose us to credit risk, which is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying investment positions. However, we continue to adhere to prudent standards for credit quality. We accomplish this by considering our product needs and overall corporate objectives, in addition to credit risk. In evaluating the initial rating, we look at the overall senior issuer rating, the explicit rating for the actual issue or the rating for the security class, and, where applicable, the appropriate designation from the Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). All of our securities have ratings from either a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or the SVO of the NAIC. In addition, we perform extensive internal credit reviews to ensure that we are consistent in applying rating criteria for all of our securities. 58 Table of Contents We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis. The distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the years ended December 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows: Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating 2009 2008 2007 AAA 7.6 % 9.9 % 18.4 % AA 58.9 36.4 44.1 A 31.4 42.0 30.2 BBB 2.1 11.7 7.3 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The increase in the percentage of debt securities purchased in the AA rated category during 2009 was due to the attractive relative value these securities presented while still meeting our investment policy guidelines for liquidity, safety and quality. The increased percentage of debt securities purchased in the AAA rated category in 2007 primarily reflected the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills by Aflac Japan prior to repatriating profits to Aflac U.S. in the third quarter of 2007. We did not purchase any perpetual securities during the periods presented in the table above. The distributions of debt and perpetual securities we own, by credit rating, as of December 31 were as follows: Composition of Portfolio by Credit Rating 2009 2008 AmortizedCost Fair Value AmortizedCost FairValue AAA 3.3 % 3.4 % 5.7 % 5.8 % AA 34.6 35.8 39.8 42.2 A 39.6 39.8 34.1 33.2 BBB 15.6 15.2 18.6 17.6 BB or lower 6.9 5.8 1.8 1.2 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Although our investment portfolio continues to be of high credit quality, many downgrades occurred during 2009, causing a shift in composition by credit rating. As of December 31, 2009, our direct and indirect exposure to securities in our investment portfolio that were guaranteed by third parties was immaterial both individually and in the aggregate. Subordination Distribution The majority of our total investments in debt and perpetual securities was senior debt at December 31, 2009 and 2008. We also maintained investments in subordinated financial instruments that primarily consisted of Lower Tier II, Upper Tier II, and Tier I securities, listed in order of seniority. The Lower Tier II (LTII) securities are debt instruments with fixed maturities. Our Upper Tier II (UTII) and Tier I investments consisted of debt instruments with fixed maturities and perpetual securities, which have an economic maturity as opposed to a stated maturity. 59 Table of Contents The following table shows the subordination distribution of our debt and perpetual securities as of December 31.

Included in our largest global investment holdings are legacy issues that date back many years. Additionally, the concentration of certain of our holdings of individual credit exposures has grown over time through merger and consolidation activity. Beginning in 2005, we have, as a general rule, limited our investment exposures to issuers to no more than 5% of total adjusted capital (TAC) on a statutory accounting basis, with the exception of obligations of the Japan and U.S. governments. However, existing investment exposures that exceeded 5% of TAC at the time this rule was adopted or exposures that may exceed this threshold from time to time through merger and consolidation activity are not automatically reduced through sales of the issuers securities but rather are reduced over time consistent with our investment policy. We have investments in both publicly and privately issued securities. The outstanding amount of a particular issuance, as well as the level of activity in a particular issuance and market conditions, including credit events and the interest rate environment, affect liquidity regardless of whether it is publicly or privately issued. The following table details investment securities by type of issuance as of December 31. Investment Securities by Type of Issuance 2009 2008 (In millions) AmortizedCost FairValue AmortizedCost FairValue Publicly issued securities: Fixed maturities $ 20,649 $ 21,087 $ 19,292 $ 19,525 Perpetual securities 116 122 156 104 Equity securities 14 15 15 18 Total publicly issued 20,779 21,224 19,463 19,647 Privately issued securities: Fixed maturities 43,671 41,522 41,178 38,571 Perpetual securities 7,438 7,141 8,918 7,943 Equity securities 8 9 9 9 Total privately issued 51,117 48,672 50,105 46,523 Total investment securities $ 71,896 $ 69,896 $ 69,568 $ 66,170 The following table details our privately issued investment securities as of December 31.

Aflac Japans investments in yen denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non Japanese issuers and have longer maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our asset/liability matching and our overall investment returns. Most of our privately issued securities are issued under medium term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and or event risk covenants are required. Below Investment Grade and Split Rated Securities In the event of a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade status, we do not automatically liquidate our position. However, if the security is in the held to maturity portfolio and we no longer have the intent to hold the security until its maturity, we immediately transfer it to the available for sale portfolio so that the securitys fair value and its unrealized gain or loss are reflected on the balance sheet. 63 Table of Contents Debt and perpetual securities classified as below investment grade at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were generally reported as available for sale and carried at fair value. Each of the below investment grade securities was investment grade at the time of purchase and was subsequently downgraded by credit rating agencies. Below investment grade debt and perpetual securities represented 6.9% of total debt and perpetual securities at December 31, 2009, compared with 1.8% of total debt and perpetual securities at December 31, 2008, at amortized cost.

This occurs when one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade. Our policy is to review each issue on a case by case basis to determine if a split rated security should be classified as investment grade or below investment grade. Our review includes evaluating the issuers credit position as well as current market pricing and other factors, such as the issuers or securitys inclusion on a credit rating downgrade watch list. As of December 31, 2009, none of our CDOs were split rated.

However, we believe it would be inappropriate to recognize impairment charges because we believe the changes in fair value are temporary. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion about the investments in the preceding table. Investment Valuation and Cash We estimate the fair values of our securities available for sale on a monthly basis. We monitor the estimated fair values obtained from our custodian and pricing brokers and those derived from our discounted cash flow pricing model for consistency from month to month, while considering current market conditions. We also periodically discuss with our custodian and pricing brokers the pricing techniques they use to monitor the consistency of their approach and periodically assess the appropriateness of the valuation level assigned to the values obtained from them. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair value hierarchy classification of our securities available for sale as of December 31, 2009. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $2.3 billion, or 3.2% of total investments and cash, as of December 31, 2009, compared with $.9 billion, or 1.4%, at December 31, 2008. For a discussion of the factors causing the change in our cash balance, see the Operating Activities, Investing Activities and Financing Activities sections of this MD&A. For additional information concerning our investments, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our deferred policy acquisition costs. Policy Liabilities The following table presents policy liabilities by segment for the years ending December 31. (In millions) 2009 2008 % Change Aflac Japan $ 62,055 $ 59,466 4.4 %* Aflac U.S. 7,187 6,750 6.5 Other 3 3 Total $ 69,245 $ 66,219 4.6 % * Aflac Japans policy liabilities increased 5.6% in yen during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in Aflac Japans policy liabilities was primarily the result of the growth and aging of our in force business. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our policy liabilities. Notes Payable Notes payable totaled $2.6 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with $1.7 billion at December 31, 2008. In April 2009, we redeemed our $450 million senior notes upon their maturity. In May 2009, the Parent Company issued $850 million in senior notes that are due in May 2019, and in December 2009, also issued $400 million in senior notes that are due in December 2039. In July 2009, the Parent Company executed a 10 billion yen loan that is due in July 2015. In August 2009, the Parent Company executed a 5 billion yen loan that is due in August 2015. During 2009, we extinguished portions of our yen denominated Uridashi and Samurai debt by buying the notes on the open market. We paid 4.4 billion yen to extinguish 6.0 billion yen of debt, yielding a realized gain from extinguishment of debt of 1.6 billion yen, or $17 million ($11 million after tax), which we included in other income. The ratio of debt to total capitalization (debt plus shareholders equity, excluding the unrealized gains and losses on investment securities) was 22.3% as of December 31, 2009, compared with 18.0% a year ago. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our notes payable. Benefit Plans Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. have various benefit plans. For additional information on our Japanese and U.S. plans, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Policyholder Protection Corporation The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. On December 12, 2008, legislation was enacted extending the framework of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC), which included government fiscal measures supporting the LIPPC through March 2012. On October 10, 2008, a small life insurance company, Yamato Life Insurance, filed for bankruptcy. The LIPPC made a decision to provide funds to Yamato Life Insurance in the amount of 27.7 billion yen. Although our future assessments for the LIPPC cannot be determined at this time, we believe the bankruptcy will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 69 Table of Contents Hedging Activities Aflac has limited hedging activities. Our primary exposure to be hedged is our investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. First, Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. Second, we have designated the Parent Companys yen denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes and yen denominated loans) as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. At the beginning of each quarter, we make our net investment hedge designation. If the total of our yen denominated liabilities is equal to or less than our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective and the related exchange effect is reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. Should these yen denominated liabilities exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, the foreign exchange effect on the portion of the liabilities that exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan would be recognized in net earnings (other income). We estimate that if our yen denominated liabilities exceeded our investment in Aflac Japan by 10 billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every one yen weakening/strengthening in the end of period yen/dollar exchange rate. For the second quarter of 2009, we de designated 678 million yen of our yen denominated liabilities, which was the amount by which our yen denominated liabilities exceeded our yen net investment position in Aflac Japan. The 678 million yen was reduced by 600 million yen during the quarter when we extinguished a portion of our outstanding Samurai debt (see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). We recognized an immaterial loss in net earnings (other income) during the quarter ended June 30, 2009, for the negative foreign exchange effect on the portion of our yen denominated liabilities that was not designated as a hedge of our net investment in Japan. At the beginning of the third and fourth quarters of 2009 when we reassessed our hedge designations, our yen net asset position exceeded our total yen denominated liabilities; therefore, all of the liabilities were designated as a hedge of our net investment in Aflac Japan, resulting in no impact on net earnings during the second half of 2009. Our net investment hedge was effective during the years ended December 31, 2008, and 2007; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings during those periods. We have interest rate swap agreements related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes. By entering into these contracts, we have been able to lock in our interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have designated these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. GAAP requires that the change in the fair value of the swap contracts be recorded in other comprehensive income so long as the hedge is deemed effective. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in net earnings (other income). These hedges were effective during the three year period ended December 31, 2009; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2009, we had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on material unconditional purchase obligations that are not recorded on our balance sheet. 70 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent Company through dividends and management fees. The following table presents the amounts provided for the years ended December 31: Liquidity Provided by Aflac to Parent Company (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Dividends declared or paid by Aflac $ 464 $ 1,062 $ 1,362 Management fees paid by Aflac 124 71 80 The primary uses of cash by the Parent Company are shareholder dividends, the repurchase of its common shares and interest on its outstanding indebtedness. The Parent Companys sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not expected to change materially in the future. For additional information, see the Financing Activities section of this MD&A. The Parent Company also accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital. In March 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue an indefinite amount of senior and subordinated debt, in one or more series, from time to time through May 2012. We issued $850 million of senior notes in May 2009 and $400 million of senior notes in December 2009 under this registration statement. In November 2009, we filed an additional shelf registration statement with Japanese regulatory authorities that allows us to issue up to 100 billion yen of yen denominated Samurai notes in Japan (approximately $1.1 billion, using the December 31, 2009, exchange rate) through November 2011. If issued, these Samurai notes would not be available to U.S. persons. We believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. For additional information, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income. The primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are policy claims, commissions, operating expenses, income taxes and payments to the Parent Company for management fees and dividends. Both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable. When making an investment decision, our first consideration is based on product needs. Our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment grade debt securities. These objectives also take into account duration matching, and because of the long term nature of our business, we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs. As a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. Therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. We expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses. The following table presents the estimated payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009. We translated our yen denominated obligations using the December 31, 2009, exchange rate. Actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. 71 Table of Contents Distribution of Payments by Period (In millions) TotalLiability* TotalPayments LessThanOne Year One toThree Years Four toFive Years AfterFive Years Future policy benefits liability $ 61,501 $ 278,065 $ 9,018 $ 17,528 $ 17,151 $ 234,368 Unpaid policy claims liability 3,270 3,270 2,463 483 190 134 Long term debt principal 2,593 2,597 428 669 1,500 Long term debt interest 16 1,572 119 226 214 1,013 Policyholder protection corporation 128 128 33 73 22 Operating service agreements N/A ** 516 115 187 147 67 Operating lease obligations N/A ** 181 63 60 25 33 Capitalized lease obligations 6 6 3 3 Marketing commitments N/A ** 51 26 25 Total contractual obligations $ 67,514 $ 286,386 $ 12,268 $ 19,254 $ 17,749 $ 237,115 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $11 have been excluded from the tabular disclosure above because the timing of cash payment is not reasonably estimable. * Liability amounts are those reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009. ** Not applicable The distribution of payments for future policy benefits is an estimate of all future benefit payments for policies in force as of December 31, 2009. These projected values contain assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality and morbidity. The distribution of payments for unpaid policy claims includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. Actual amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above. We anticipate that the future policy benefit liability of $61.5 billion at December 31, 2009, along with future net premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund future policy benefit payments. The distribution of payments due in less than one year for long term debt consists of 39.4 billion yen for our Samurai notes ($428 million at the December 31, 2009, exchange rate) that are due in July 2010. We plan to use existing cash to redeem these notes. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Consolidated Cash Flows We translate cash flows for Aflac Japans yen denominated items into U.S. dollars using weighted average exchange rates. In years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. The following table summarizes consolidated cash flows by activity for the years ended December 31. Consolidated Cash Flows by Activity (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Operating activities $ 6,161 $ 4,965 $ 4,656 Investing activities (5,476 ) (4,283 ) (3,654 ) Financing activities 699 (1,383 ) (655 ) Exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents (2 ) 79 13 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,382 $ (622 ) $ 360 72 Table of Contents Operating Activities Consolidated cash flow from operations increased 24% in 2009, compared with 2008. The following table summarizes operating cash flows by source for the years ended December 31. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Aflac Japan $ 5,177 $ 4,225 $ 3,573 Aflac U.S. and other operations 984 740 1,083 Total $ 6,161 $ 4,965 $ 4,656 The increase in Aflac Japan operating cash flows during 2009 was due primarily to the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. Despite an overall increase in 2009, Aflac U.S. operating cash flows have been reduced by the payout of lump sum return of premium benefits to policyholders on a closed block of U.S. cancer insurance business. These benefit payouts began in 2008 and will conclude in 2012. We paid out $152 million in 2009 and $63 million in 2008, and we anticipate paying out an additional $213 million over the next three years. Investing Activities Operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase debt securities to meet future policy obligations. The following table summarizes investing cash flows by source for the years ended December 31. Net Cash Used by Investing Activities (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Aflac Japan $ (5,156 ) $ (3,874 ) $ (3,231 ) Aflac U.S. and other operations (320 ) (409 ) (423 ) Total $ (5,476 ) $ (4,283 ) $ (3,654 ) The increase in Aflac Japan cash used by investing activities during 2009 was due primarily to the return of $1.2 billion in cash that we were holding as cash collateral for loaned securities in our short term security lending arrangements. Prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. Currently, when our debt and perpetual securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, the long term nature of our business and our strong cash flows provide us with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. When market opportunities arise, we dispose of selected debt and perpetual securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and or rebalance our portfolio. As a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year. Dispositions before maturity were approximately 12% of the annual average investment portfolio of debt and perpetual securities available for sale during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with 4% for the years ended December 31, 2008, and 2007. This increase in 2009 was due primarily to a bond swap program that we executed to generate investment gains to take advantage of tax loss carryforwards. Financing Activities Consolidated cash provided by financing activities was $699 million in 2009, compared with consolidated cash used by financing activities of $1.4 billion in 2008 and $655 million in 2007. In April 73 Table of Contents 2009, we redeemed our $450 million senior notes and settled the related cross currency, interest rate swaps that were used to convert the original dollar denominated debt obligation into yen. In May 2009, the Parent Company issued $850 million in senior notes that are due in May 2019, and in December 2009, also issued $400 million in senior notes that are due in December 2039. In July 2009, the Parent Company executed a 10 billion yen loan that is due in July 2015. In August 2009, the Parent Company executed a 5 billion yen loan that is due in August 2015. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends was $524 million in 2009, compared with cash returned to shareholders through dividends and treasury stock purchases of $1.9 billion in 2008 and $979 million in 2007. During 2009, we extinguished portions of our yen denominated Uridashi and Samurai debt by buying the notes on the open market. We paid 4.4 billion yen to extinguish 6.0 billion yen of debt, yielding a realized gain from extinguishment of debt of 1.6 billion yen, or $17 million ($11 million after tax), which we included in other income. In July 2010, 39.4 billion yen (approximately $428 million using the December 31, 2009, exchange rate) of our Samurai notes will mature. We plan to use existing cash to pay off these notes. We have no restrictive financial covenants related to our notes payable. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable at December 31, 2009. The following tables present a summary of treasury stock activity during the years ended December 31. Treasury Stock Purchased (In millions of dollars and thousands of shares) 2009 2008 2007 Treasury stock purchases $ 10 $ 1,490 $ 606 Number of shares purchased: Open market 23,201 11,073 Other 264 146 559 Total shares purchased 264 23,347 11,632 Treasury Stock Issued (In millions of dollars and thousands of shares) 2009 2008 2007 Stock issued from treasury $ 17 $ 32 $ 47 Number of shares issued 1,043 2,001 2,723 During 2009, we did not repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market. In 2008, under share repurchase authorizations from our board of directors, we purchased 23.2 million shares of our common stock in the open market, funded with internal capital. The total 23.2 million shares was comprised of 12.5 million shares purchased through an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (Merrill Lynch) and 10.7 million shares purchased through Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.). See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. As of December 31, 2009, a remaining balance of 32.4 million shares of our common stock was available for purchase under share repurchase authorizations by our board of directors. The 32.4 million shares available for purchase were comprised of 2.4 million shares remaining from an authorization from the board of directors in 2006 and 30.0 million shares from a board authorization in 2008. We will closely monitor global financial markets and our capital position before we commit to further share repurchases. 74 Table of Contents Cash dividends paid to shareholders in 2009 of $1.12 per share increased 16.7% over 2008. The 2008 dividend paid of $.96 per share increased 20.0% over 2007. The following table presents the sources of dividends to shareholders for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Dividends paid in cash $ 524 $ 434 $ 373 Dividends declared but not paid (131 ) 131 (91 ) Dividends through issuance of treasury shares 20 19 Total dividends to shareholders $ 393 $ 585 $ 301 In February 2010, the board of directors declared the first quarter 2010 cash dividend of $.28 per share. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2010. Regulatory Restrictions Aflac is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to its regulations. The Nebraska insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. These regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by Aflac to the Parent Company. A life insurance companys statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the NAIC, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance companys state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from GAAP and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. The continued long term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations. Aflacs insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings. The NAICs risk based capital (RBC) formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. The RBC formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurers operations. Aflacs company action level RBC ratio was 479% as of December 31, 2009. Our RBC ratio remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. As of December 31, 2009, our total adjusted capital exceeded the amounts to achieve a company action level RBC of 400% and 350% by $953 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the impact of permitted practices by the Nebraska Department of Insurance on our statutory capital and surplus. Currently, the NAIC has ongoing regulatory initiatives relating to revisions to the RBC formula as well as numerous initiatives covering insurance products, investments, and other actuarial and accounting matters. In addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by U.S. insurance regulators, Japans FSA may not allow profit repatriations or other transfers from Aflac Japan if they would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders. The FSA maintains its own solvency standard. As of December 31, 2009, Aflac Japans solvency margin ratio was 885.5%, which significantly exceeds regulatory minimums. See the Japanese Regulatory Environment section of this MD&A for a discussion of proposed changes to the calculation of the solvency margin ratio. 75 Table of Contents Payments are made from Aflac Japan to the Parent Company for management fees and to Aflac U.S. for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings. The following table details Aflac Japan remittances for the years ended December 31. Aflac Japan Remittances (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2009 2008 2007 Aflac Japan management fees paid to Parent Company $ 26 $ 26 $ 32 Expenses allocated to Aflac Japan 37 36 33 Aflac Japan profit remittances to Aflac U.S. in dollars 230 598 567 Aflac Japan profit remittances to Aflac U.S. in yen 20.0 64.1 67.8 Aflac Japan remitted less profit to Aflac U.S. in 2009 to support its solvency margin ratio. For additional information on regulatory restrictions on dividends, profit repatriations and other transfers, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Rating Agencies Aflac is rated AA by S&P, Aa2 (Excellent) by Moodys, and A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best for financial strength and AA by R&I for insurance claims paying ability. Aflac Incorporateds senior debt, Samurai notes, and Uridashi notes are rated A by S&P, A2 by Moodys and A by R&I. S&P, Moodys and A.M. Best have classified Aflacs credit outlook as negative, consistent with their outlook on the insurance industry. R&I has classified Aflacs credit outlook as stable.
