ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those informational statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements. We desire to take advantage of these provisions. This report contains cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected herein, and in any other statements made by Company officials in communications with the financial community and contained in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Forward looking statements are not based on historical information and relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Furthermore, forward looking information is subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements containing words such as expect, anticipate, believe, goal, objective, may, should, estimate, intends, projects, will, assumes, potential, target or similar words as well as specific projections of future results, generally qualify as forward looking. Aflac undertakes no obligation to update such forward looking statements. We caution readers that the following factors, in addition to other factors mentioned from time to time, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements: difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets defaults and downgrades in certain securities in our investment portfolio impairment of financial institutions credit and other risks associated with Aflacs investment in perpetual securities differing judgments applied to investment valuations subjective determinations of amount of impairments taken on our investments limited availability of acceptable yen denominated investments concentration of our investments in any particular sector concentration of business in Japan ongoing changes in our industry exposure to significant financial and capital markets risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates significant changes in investment yield rates deviations in actual experience from pricing and reserving assumptions subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to Aflac Incorporated changes in law or regulation by governmental authorities ability to attract and retain qualified sales associates and employees decreases in our financial strength or debt ratings ability to continue to develop and implement improvements in information technology systems changes in U.S. and or Japanese accounting standards failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security level and outcome of litigation ability to effectively manage key executive succession catastrophic events failure of internal controls or corporate governance policies and procedures 33 Table of Contents MD&A OVERVIEW Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of Aflac Incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three year period ended December 31, 2010. As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes. This MD&A is divided into the following sections: Our Business Performance Highlights Critical Accounting Estimates Results of Operations, consolidated and by segment Analysis of Financial Condition, including discussion of market risks of financial instruments Capital Resources and Liquidity, including discussion of availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash OUR BUSINESS Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. The Companys insurance business is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflacs policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Aflac U.S. markets and administers group products through Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC). Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business. PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS Results for 2010 benefited from the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate and lower realized investment losses. Total revenues rose 13.6% to $20.7 billion, compared with $18.3 billion a year ago. Net earnings were $2.3 billion, or $4.95 per diluted share, compared with $1.5 billion, or $3.19 per diluted share, in 2009. We experienced pretax net realized investment losses of $422 million ($274 million after tax) in 2010, which included $459 million ($298 million after tax) of other than temporary impairments and $1 million ($.7 million after tax) of net derivative losses. Shareholders equity at December 31, 2010, included a net unrealized gain on investment securities (including derivatives) of $64 million, compared with a net unrealized loss of $640 million at December 31, 2009. In 2010, we issued a total of $750 million in dollar denominated senior notes raised through U.S. public debt offerings. In July, we paid $447 million to redeem 39.4 billion yen of our Samurai notes upon their maturity. We resumed stock repurchase activity in the fourth quarter of 2010 by purchasing a total of 2.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In this MD&A, references to GAAP issued by the FASB are derived from the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM (ASC). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of Aflacs results of operations and financial condition are those related to the valuation of investments and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs, liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, and income taxes. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from managements analyses and judgments. The application of 34 Table of Contents these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 95% of our assets and 86% of our liabilities are reported as of December 31, 2010, and thus has a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders equity. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results. Investments and Derivatives Aflacs investments in debt, perpetual and equity securities include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For privately issued securities, we receive pricing data from external sources that take into account each securitys credit quality and liquidity characteristics. We also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. These reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The identification of distressed investments, the determination of fair value if not publicly traded, and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require evaluation of factors, including but not limited to: issuer financial condition, including profitability and cash flows credit status of the issuer the issuers specific and general competitive environment published reports general economic environment regulatory, legislative and political environment the severity of the decline in fair value the length of time the fair value is below cost our intent, need, or both to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery in value other factors as may become available from time to time Our derivatives are primarily interest rate, foreign currency and credit default swaps that are associated with investments in special purpose entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) where we are the primary beneficiary. These interest rate swaps and certain foreign currency swaps are priced by broker quotations using inputs that are observable in the market. Inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest rates, foreign currency forward and spot rates, credit spreads, and interest volatility. For our credit default swaps and certain foreign currency swaps, there are limited or no observable valuation inputs. We estimate the fair value of these instruments by obtaining broker quotes from a limited number of brokers. These brokers base their quotes on a combination of their knowledge of the current pricing environment and market conditions. See Notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Policy Liabilities Aflacs products are generally long duration fixed benefit indemnity contracts. We make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business to match expected policy benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with expected policy premiums. These assumptions include persistency, morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses. If actual results match the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs, profits will emerge as a level percentage of earned premiums. However, because actual results will vary from the assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary from year to year. We measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business. Our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our DAC is recoverable. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policys premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income. Future amortization of DAC is based upon our estimates of persistency, interest and future premium revenue generally established at the time of policy issuance. However, the unamortized balance of DAC reflects actual persistency. 35 Table of Contents As presented in the following table, the ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has shown a slight upward trend for Aflac Japan for the last three years. This trend is a result of a greater proportion of our annualized premiums being under the alternative commission schedule, which pays a higher commission on first year premiums and lower commissions on renewal premiums. This schedule is very popular with our new agents as it helps them with cash flow for personal and business needs as they build their business. While this has resulted in a higher unamortized DAC balance, the overall cost to the Company has been reduced. The ratio of unamortized DAC to annualized premiums in force has also increased for Aflac U.S. for the last three years. The increase has been primarily driven by a greater proportion of our annualized premiums being under an accelerated commission schedule for new associates and was also impacted by the loss of a large payroll account in 2010 which had a lower ratio of DAC to annualized premiums in force. Deferred Policy Acquisition Cost Ratios Aflac Japan Aflac U.S. (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Deferred policy acquisition costs $ 6,964 $ 5,846 $ 5,644 $ 2,770 $ 2,687 $ 2,593 Annualized premiums in force 15,408 13,034 12,761 4,973 4,956 4,789 Deferred policy acquisition costs as a percentage of annualized premiums in force 45.2 % 44.9 % 44.2 % 55.7 % 54.2 % 54.1 % Policy Liabilities The following table provides details of policy liabilities by segment and in total as of December 31. Policy Liabilities (In millions) 2010 2009 Japan segment: Future policy benefits $ 66,023 $ 55,720 Unpaid policy claims 2,592 2,246 Other policy liabilities 6,257 4,089 Total Japan policy liabilities $ 74,872 $ 62,055 U.S. segment: Future policy benefits $ 6,078 $ 5,779 Unpaid policy claims 1,126 1,023 Other policy liabilities 377 385 Total U.S. policy liabilities $ 7,581 $ 7,187 Consolidated: Future policy benefits $ 72,103 $ 61,501 Unpaid policy claims 3,719 3,270 Other policy liabilities 6,634 4,474 Total consolidated policy liabilities $ 82,456 $ 69,245 Our policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with applicable guidelines as defined under GAAP and Actuarial Standards of Practice, include two components that involve analysis and judgment: future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 87% and 5% of total policy liabilities as of December 31, 2010, respectively. Future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. We calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. These 36 Table of Contents assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued. The assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. As required by GAAP, we also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience. Unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us. We compute unpaid policy claims on a non discounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. We update the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability. Our insurance products provide fixed benefit amounts per occurrence that are not subject to medical cost inflation. Furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the United States and Japan. This geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. Claims incurred under Aflacs policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. The unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. Severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. Our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders. As a part of our established financial reporting and accounting practices and controls, we perform actuarial reviews of our policyholder liabilities on an ongoing basis and reflect the results of those reviews in our results of operations and financial condition as required by GAAP. Our fourth quarter 2010 review indicated that we needed to strengthen the liability for a closed block of dementia policies in Japan, primarily due to low interest rate yields. We strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $93 million for this closed block of policies. In computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. We monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. Claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. In calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, we do not calculate a range of estimates. The following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of December 31, 2010, to changes in severity and frequency of claims. For the years 2008 through 2010, our assumptions changed on average by approximately 1% in total, and we believe that a variation in assumptions in a range of plus or minus 1% in total is reasonably likely to occur. Sensitivity of Unpaid Policy Claims Liability (In millions) Total Severity Total Frequency Decreaseby 2% Decreaseby 1% Unchanged Increaseby 1% Increaseby 2% Increase by 2% $ 0 $ 22 $ 45 $ 68 $ 91 Increase by 1% (22 ) 0 22 45 68 Unchanged (44 ) (22 ) 0 22 45 Decrease by 1% (66 ) (44 ) (22 ) 0 22 Decrease by 2% (87 ) (66 ) (44 ) (22 ) 0 37 Table of Contents The table below reflects the growth of future policy benefits liability for the years ended December 31. Future Policy Benefits (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2010 2009 2008 Aflac U.S. $ 6,078 $ 5,779 $ 5,442 Growth rate 5.2 % 6.2 % 9.8 % Aflac Japan $ 66,023 $ 55,720 $ 53,866 Growth rate 18.5 % 3.4 % 32.3 % Consolidated $ 72,103 $ 61,501 $ 59,310 Growth rate 17.2 % 3.7 % 29.9 % Yen/dollar exchange rate (end of period) 81.49 92.10 91.03 Aflac Japan (in yen) 5,380 5,132 4,903 Growth rate 4.8 % 4.7 % 5.5 % The growth of the future policy benefits liability in dollars has been primarily due to the aging of our in force block of business and the addition of new business in Japan. This growth in dollars was enhanced by the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar in 2010 and 2008; however, it was offset in 2009 by the weakening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. Income Taxes Income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing our income tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with GAAP is a two step process. Under the first step, the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The second step is measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. New Accounting Pronouncements During the last three years, various accounting standard setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. For information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 38 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table is a presentation of items impacting net earnings and net earnings per diluted share for the years ended December 31. Items Impacting Net Earnings In Millions Per Diluted Share 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Net earnings $ 2,344 $ 1,497 $ 1,254 $ 4.95 $ 3.19 $ 2.62 Items impacting net earnings, net of tax: Realized investment gains (losses): Securities transactions and impairments (273 ) (788 ) (655 ) (.58 ) (1.67 ) (1.37 ) Impact from ASC 810 (1 ) 0 0 .00 .00 .00 Impact from ASC 815 0 (3 ) (3 ) .00 (.01 ) .00 Gain on extinguishment of debt 0 11 0 .00 .02 .00 Realized Investment Gains and Losses Our investment strategy is to invest in fixed income securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the Companys profitability. This investment strategy aligns our assets with our liability structure, which our assets support. We do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and or general portfolio maintenance and rebalancing. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the principal drivers of our profitability. Securities Transactions and Impairments In 2010, we realized pretax investment losses of $459 million ($298 million after tax) as a result of the recognition of other than temporary impairment losses. We realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $38 million ($25 million after tax) from securities sold or redeemed in the normal course of business. In 2009, we realized pretax investment losses of $1,361 million ($884 million after tax) as a result of the recognition of other than temporary impairment losses. We realized pretax investment losses of $101 million ($66 million after tax) from the exchange of certain perpetual security investments into fixed maturity securities. The losses were partially offset by pretax investment gains of $250 million ($162 million after tax) that were generated primarily from a bond swap program that took advantage of tax loss carryforwards. In 2008, we realized pretax investment losses of $753 million ($489 million after tax) as a result of the recognition of other than temporary impairment losses. We also realized pretax investment losses, net of gains, of $254 million ($166 million after tax) from securities sold or redeemed in the normal course of business. The following table details our pretax impairment losses by investment category for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Perpetual securities $ 160 $ 729 $ 379 Corporate bonds 285 458 160 Collateralized debt obligations 0 148 213 Mortgage and asset backed securities 12 24 0 Equity securities 2 2 1 Total other than temporary impairment losses realized $ 459 $ 1,361 $ 753 39 Table of Contents Impact from ASC 810 Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted updated accounting guidance in ASC 810, Consolidation, which resulted in the consolidation of certain VIEs in which we have an investment. Upon consolidation, the beneficial interest in these VIEs was derecognized and the underlying collateral assets (fixed maturity securities and perpetual securities) and corresponding foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps were recognized. The change in value of the swaps is recorded through current period earnings, and the change in value of the available for sale fixed maturity and perpetual securities associated with these swaps is recorded through other comprehensive income. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we realized pretax investment losses, net of gains, of $1 million ($.7 million after tax) from valuing foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps related to our consolidated VIEs. For additional information regarding realized investment gains and losses, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impact from ASC 815 For a description of items that would be included in the Impact from ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, see the Hedging Activities subsection of MD&A and Notes 4 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Debt Extinguishment We did not extinguish any debt during 2010. During 2009, we extinguished portions of our yen denominated Uridashi and Samurai debt by buying the notes on the open market. We realized a total gain from extinguishment of debt of 1.6 billion yen, or $17 million ($11 million after tax), which we included in other income. Foreign Currency Translation Aflac Japans premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we primarily purchase yen denominated assets to support yen denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. We translate Aflac Japans yen denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its yen denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our Company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, management evaluates Aflacs financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Income Taxes Our combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was 34.6% in 2010, 33.0% in 2009 and 34.5% in 2008. The effective tax rate declined in 2009 due primarily to the settlement of an examination by the Internal Revenue Service that reduced the ASC 740 tax liability by $24 million. Total income taxes were $1.2 billion in 2010, compared with $738 million in 2009 and $660 million in 2008. Japanese income taxes on Aflac Japans results account for most of our consolidated income tax expense. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 40 Table of Contents Earnings Guidance We communicate earnings guidance in this report based on the growth in net earnings per diluted share. However, certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of managements control may have a significant impact on actual results. Therefore, our comparison of net earnings includes certain assumptions to reflect the limitations that are inherent in projections of net earnings. In comparing period over period results, we exclude the effect of realized investment gains and losses (securities transactions, impairments, and the impact from ASC 810), the impact from ASC 815, and nonrecurring items. We also assume no impact from foreign currency translation on the Aflac Japan segment and the Parent Companys yen denominated interest expense for a given year in relation to the prior year. Subject to the preceding assumptions, our objective for 2010 was to increase net earnings per diluted share by 9% to 12% over 2009. We reported 2010 net earnings per diluted share of $4.95. Adjusting that number for realized investment losses ($.58 per diluted share), the impact from ASC 815 (nil per diluted share), and foreign currency translation (a gain of $.19 per diluted share), we met our objective for the year. Our objective for 2011 is to increase net earnings per diluted share by 8% to 12% over 2010, excluding the effect of realized investment gains and losses, the impact from ASC 815, nonrecurring items, and foreign currency translation. If we achieve our objective, the following table shows the likely results for 2011 net earnings per diluted share, including the impact of foreign currency translation using various yen/dollar exchange rate scenarios. 2011 Net Earnings Per Share (EPS) Scenarios(1) Weighted Average Yen/Dollar Exchange Rate Net Earnings Per Diluted Share % Growth Over 2010 Yen Impact on EPS 80.00 $6.34 6.56 14.6 18.6% $.37 85.00 6.09 6.31 10.1 14.1 .12 87.69(2) 5.97 6.19 8.0 11.9 0 90.00 5.87 6.09 6.1 10.1 (.10) 95.00 5.68 5.90 2.7 6.7 (.29) (1) Excludes realized investment gains/losses (securities transactions, impairments, and the impact from ASC 810), the impact from ASC 815, and nonrecurring items in 2011 and 2010 (2) Actual 2010 weighted average exchange rate If interest rates remain at historically low levels, earnings growth in 2011 would likely be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range. If we assume 8% earnings per share growth, we would earn $5.97 per diluted share, excluding the effect of realized investment gains and losses, the impact from ASC 815, nonrecurring items, and foreign currency translation. If the yen/dollar exchange rate averages 80 to 85 for the full year, we would expect reported net earnings to be in the range of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share, on the basis described above. INSURANCE OPERATIONS Aflacs insurance business consists of two segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. Aflac Japan, which operates as a branch of Aflac, is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. GAAP financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual financial statements. Furthermore, we are required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets. We measure and evaluate our insurance segments financial performance using operating earnings on a pretax basis. We define segment operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses (securities transactions, impairments, and the impact from ASC 810), the impact from ASC 815, and nonrecurring items. We believe that an analysis of segment pretax operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is conducted in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars. 41 Table of Contents We evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales, an industry operating measure. New annualized premium sales, which include both new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, represent the premiums that we would collect over a 12 month period, assuming the policies remain in force. For Aflac Japan, new annualized premium sales are determined by applications submitted during the reporting period. For Aflac U.S., new annualized premium sales are determined by applications that are issued during the reporting period. Premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period. AFLAC JAPAN SEGMENT Aflac Japan Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac Japans pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac Japan for the years ended December 31. Aflac Japan Summary of Operating Results (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Premium income $ 13,487 $ 12,178 $ 10,674 Net investment income: Yen denominated investment income 1,645 1,510 1,312 Dollar denominated investment income 808 755 741 Net investment income 2,453 2,265 2,053 Other income (loss) 37 43 15 Total operating revenues 15,977 14,486 12,742 Benefits and claims 9,553 8,746 7,972 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 597 523 405 Insurance commissions 1,103 1,060 970 Insurance and other expenses 1,441 1,357 1,145 Total operating expenses 3,141 2,940 2,520 Total benefits and expenses 12,694 11,686 10,492 Pretax operating earnings(1) $ 3,283 $ 2,800 $ 2,250 Weighted average yen/dollar exchange rate 87.69 93.49 103.46 In Dollars In Yen Percentage change over previous year: 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Premium income 10.8 % 14.1 % 18.1 % 3.8 % 3.3 % 3.5 % Net investment income 8.3 10.3 14.0 1.6 (.1 ) .0 Total operating revenues 10.3 13.7 17.3 3.4 3.0 2.8 Pretax operating earnings(1) 17.3 24.4 23.6 10.0 12.4 8.4 (1) See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings. The percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force. The increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of 4.6% in 2010, 3.3% in 2009 and 3.2% in 2008 reflect the high persistency of Aflac Japans business and the sales of new policies. Annualized premiums in force at December 31, 2010, were 1.26 trillion yen, compared with 1.20 trillion yen in 2009 and 1.16 trillion yen in 2008. Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year end exchange rates, were $15.4 billion in 2010, $13.0 billion in 2009, and $12.8 billion in 2008. Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of dollar denominated and reverse dual currency securities (yen denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). Dollar denominated investment income from these assets accounted for approximately 33% of Aflac Japans investment income in 2010 and 2009, compared with 36% in 2008. In years when 42 Table of Contents the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating Aflac Japans dollar denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen weakens, translating dollar denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. On a constant currency basis, dollar denominated investment income accounted for approximately 34% of Aflac Japans investment income during 2010, compared with 36% in 2009 and 39% in 2008. The following table illustrates the effect of translating Aflac Japans dollar denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year. Aflac Japan Percentage Changes Over Prior Year (Yen Operating Results) Including ForeignCurrency Changes Excluding ForeignCurrency Changes(2) 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Net investment income 1.6% (.1)% .0% 3.8% 3.4% 5.0% Total operating revenues 3.4 3.0 2.8 3.8 3.5 3.8 Pretax operating earnings(1) 10.0 12.4 8.4 12.1 15.1 13.8 (1) See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings. (2) Amounts excluding foreign currency changes on dollar denominated items were determined using the same yen/dollar exchange rate for the current year as each respective prior year. The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac Japan for the years ended December 31. Ratios to total revenues: 2010 2009 2008 Benefits and claims 59.8 % 60.4 % 62.5 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 3.7 3.6 3.2 Insurance commissions 6.9 7.3 7.6 Insurance and other expenses 9.0 9.4 9.0 Total operating expenses 19.6 20.3 19.8 Pretax operating earnings(1) 20.6 19.3 17.7 (1) See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings. The benefit ratio has declined over the past several years, driven primarily by favorable claim trends in our cancer product line. We expect this improvement to continue. However, this improvement is partially offset by the effect of low investment yields which impacts our profit margin by reducing the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves (see table and discussion in the Interest Rate Risk section of this MD&A). Our operating ratios have also been impacted by strong sales results in our Ordinary products including Child Endowment and WAYS. These products have higher benefit ratios and lower expense ratios than our third sector products. Due to improvement in the benefit ratio and operating expense ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded in 2010. In 2011, we expect further improvement in the benefit and expense ratios, resulting in continued expansion in the profit margin. Aflac Japan Sales Our stated objective for 2010 was for sales to be flat to up 5%. We exceeded our objective with an 11.0% increase in sales during 2010. The following table presents Aflac Japans new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31. In Dollars In Yen (In millions of dollars and billions of yen) 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 New annualized premium sales $ 1,554 $ 1,310 $ 1,115 135.8 122.3 114.7 Increase (decrease) over prior year 18.6 % 17.5 % 14.4 % 11.0 % 6.7 % .0 % 43 Table of Contents The following table details the contributions to new annualized premium sales by major insurance product for the years ended December 31. 2010 2009 2008 Medical 34 % 39 % 39 % Cancer 22 28 34 Ordinary life: Child endowment 19 9 2 WAYS 9 6 5 Other ordinary life 12 14 16 Other 4 4 4 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % The medical insurance product was the principal contributor to total sales for 2010. In 2010, we maintained our position as the number one seller of medical insurance policies in Japan. Medical insurance sales decreased 3.2% during 2010, compared with 2009, reflecting a difficult comparison to prior year sales which had benefited from the introduction of a new version of EVER, our popular medical product. In June 2010, we introduced a revision to Gentle EVER, our non standard medical product. This new product offers more benefits than the original non standard medical product that we began offering in 2007. We believe it will continue to meet the needs of certain consumers who cannot qualify for our base EVER plan. With continued cost pressure on Japans health care system, we expect the need for medical products will continue to rise in the future, and we remain encouraged about the outlook for the medical insurance market. Cancer insurance sales declined 13.5% during 2010, compared with 2009; despite this decrease, we remained the number one seller of cancer insurance policies in Japan. We are convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio. In June 2010, we introduced a product called Corsage, which is a female specific rider to our cancer insurance product. In Japan, young women are more likely to suffer from cancer than young men. Corsage provides surgery benefits that address the high cost of treating female specific cancers. As the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan, we believe this new product will further strengthen our brand, and most importantly, provide valuable benefits to consumers who are looking for solutions to cancer related costs. The bank channel generated new annualized premium sales of 19.9 billion yen in 2010, an increase of 165.1% compared with 2009. As the bank channel has become a larger contributor to sales, Aflac Japan has enhanced its product portfolio to better meet the needs of banks. These products include our child endowment product and WAYS, a product that we first introduced in 2006 and introduced to the bank channel in 2009. The child endowment product is primarily used to help fund the higher costs associated with a child entering high school and college in Japan. We have successfully linked the marketing of our child endowment product to the new government subsidy that was first paid in June 2010 to families with children age 15 and younger. Sales of our child endowment product were 25.3 billion yen during 2010, an increase of 132.0% compared with 2009. We believe that life insurance products, like our child endowment plan, provide further opportunities for us to sell our third sector cancer and medical products. WAYS is a unique hybrid product that starts out as a whole life policy. When policyholders reach a predetermined age, they can choose to convert a large part of their life benefit to a fixed annuity, medical coverage or nursing care benefits. Sales of WAYS were 12.1 billion yen during 2010, an increase of 65.7% compared with 2009. With the importance of the bank channel distribution outlet, we expect sales of this innovative and flexible product to grow substantially. At December 31, 2010, we had agreements with 364 banks, or more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan, to sell our products. Of all the banks we now have enrolling our products, there are still many branches in their system that are not actively selling yet, which indicates there is still significant sales growth potential through this channel. We continue to have significantly more banks selling our third sector insurance products than any other insurer operating in Japan. We believe our long standing and strong relationships within the Japanese banking sector, along with our strategic preparations, have proven to be an advantage as this channel opened up for our types of products. 44 Table of Contents We remain committed to selling through our traditional channels, which allows us to reach consumers through affiliated corporate agencies, independent corporate agencies and individual agencies. In 2010, we recruited approximately 4,800 new sales agencies, an increase of 4.4% over 2009. At December 31, 2010, Aflac Japan was represented by more than 19,600 sales agencies and more than 115,400 licensed sales associates employed by those agencies. We believe that there is still a continued need for our products in Japan. Following strong sales growth in 2009 and 2010, our objective for 2011 is for new annualized premium sales to be in the range of down 2% to up 3% in Japan. Aflac Japan Investments Growth of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, and the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on dollar denominated investment income. Aflac Japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than those available on Japanese government or other public corporate bonds, while still adhering to prudent standards for credit quality. All of our privately issued securities are rated investment grade at the time of purchase. These securities are generally issued with documentation consistent with standard medium term note programs. In addition, many of these investments have protective covenants appropriate to the specific issuer, industry and country. These covenants often require the issuer to adhere to specific financial ratios and give priority to repayment of our investment under certain circumstances. The following table presents the results of Aflac Japans investment yields for the years ended December 31. 2010 2009 2008 New money yield yen only 2.39 % 2.80 % 3.20 % New money yield blended 2.63 3.03 3.43 Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 3.48 3.65 3.82 The decrease in the Aflac Japan new money yield reflects the low level of interest rates and tightening credit spreads. At December 31, 2010, the yield on Aflac Japans investment portfolio, including dollar denominated investments, was 3.56%, compared with 3.77% a year ago. In order to address our challenge of investing in Japans low interest rate environment, in 2010 we started increasing the amount Aflac Japan invests in higher yielding dollar denominated securities. The overall credit quality of Aflac Japans investments remained high. At the end of 2010, 93.6% of Aflac Japans debt and perpetual securities were rated investment grade, on an amortized cost basis. See Notes 3 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Analysis of Financial Condition section of this MD&A for additional information on our investments. Japanese Economy The Bank of Japans January 2011 Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments stated that Japans economy still shows signs of moderate recovery, however the recovery pace has slowed. The employment and income situation has been depressed, but seems to be easing. Exports have been weak, however they are expected to increase moderately again. Private consumption is expected to pick up. The report projected that Japans economy is expected to gradually return to a moderate recovery path. Japans system of compulsory public health care insurance provides medical coverage to every Japanese citizen. These public medical expenditures are covered by a combination of premiums paid by insureds and their employers, taxes and copayments from the people who receive medical service. However, given Japans aging population, the resources available to these publicly funded social insurance programs have come under increasing pressure. As a result, copayments and other out of pocket expenses have been rising and affecting more people. We believe higher out of pocket expenses will lead consumers to purchase more supplemental medical insurance. Many insurance companies have recognized the opportunities for selling supplemental medical insurance in Japan 45 Table of Contents and have launched new products in recent years. However, we believe our favorable cost structure compared with other insurers makes us a very effective competitor. In addition, we believe our brand, customer service and financial strength also benefit our market position. Japanese Regulatory Environment We expect that our distribution system will continue to evolve in Japan. Regulatory changes that took effect in December 2007 enabled banks to sell our type of insurance products to their customers. Our strong brand as the leading seller of cancer and medical insurance products in Japan and our many long term relationships within the Japan banking sector place us in a strong position to sell through this channel. Japans Financial Services Agency (FSA) maintains a solvency standard, which is used by Japanese regulators to monitor the financial strength of insurance companies. The FSA will apply a revised method of calculating the solvency margin ratio for life insurance companies as of fiscal year end 2011 (March 31, 2012) and requires the disclosure of the ratio as reference information for fiscal year end 2010 (March 31, 2011). The FSA has stated that the revision would generally reduce life insurance companies solvency margin ratios to approximately half the level of those reported under the current calculation method. We do not expect our relative position within the industry to materially change. In 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japans postal system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. The privatization laws split Japan Post into four entities that began operating in October 2007. In 2007, one of these entities selected Aflac Japan as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through its post offices, and, in 2008, we began selling cancer insurance through these post offices. Japan Post has historically been a popular place for consumers to purchase insurance products. Currently, our products are being offered in approximately 1,000 post offices. Japan Post reform legislation was introduced in the 2010 Japanese ordinary Diet session, but the session ended before the legislation could be passed. The legislation again failed to pass in the 2010 fall Diet session and is scheduled to be taken up in the 2011 ordinary Diet session, which opened on January 24, 2011. Given that the ruling coalition no longer controls a majority in the Diets upper house following its defeat in the July 2010 election, it is unclear whether the postal reform legislation will be passed in the 2011 ordinary Diet session. Regardless, we believe that the Diet debate on postal reform is unlikely to change Aflac Japans relationship with the post office company. 46 Table of Contents AFLAC U.S. SEGMENT Aflac U.S. Pretax Operating Earnings Changes in Aflac U.S. pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac U.S. for the years ended December 31. Aflac U.S. Summary of Operating Results (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Premium income $ 4,586 $ 4,444 $ 4,272 Net investment income 549 499 505 Other income 11 10 10 Total operating revenues 5,146 4,953 4,787 Benefits and claims 2,553 2,561 2,527 Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 433 419 370 Insurance commissions 534 508 488 Insurance and other expenses 702 689 657 Total operating expenses 1,669 1,616 1,515 Total benefits and expenses 4,222 4,177 4,042 Pretax operating earnings(1) $ 924 $ 776 $ 745 Percentage change over previous year: Premium income 3.2 % 4.0 % 8.5 % Net investment income 9.9 (1.1 ) .9 Total operating revenues 3.9 3.5 7.7 Pretax operating earnings(1) 19.2 4.1 7.6 (1) See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings. Annualized premiums in force increased .3% in 2010, 3.5% in 2009 and 6.2% in 2008. Annualized premiums in force at December 31 were $5.0 billion in 2010 and 2009, compared with $4.8 billion in 2008. The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac U.S. for the years ended December 31. Ratios to total revenues: 2010 2009 2008 Benefits and claims 49.6 % 51.7 % 52.8 % Operating expenses: Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 8.4 8.5 7.7 Insurance commissions 10.4 10.3 10.2 Insurance and other expenses 13.6 13.8 13.7 Total operating expenses 32.4 32.6 31.6 Pretax operating earnings(1) 18.0 15.7 15.6 (1) See the Insurance Operations section of this MD&A for our definition of segment operating earnings. The pretax operating profit margin expanded during 2010, compared with 2009, primarily driven by the loss of a large payroll account in 2010. The loss of this account resulted in the release of the future policy benefit reserves and amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs for policies associated with this account. The net result had a positive impact on the profit margin. In 2011, we expect the benefit and operating expense ratios and the pretax operating profit margin to be in a range similar to the levels experienced in 2009 and 2008. 47 Table of Contents Aflac U.S. Sales The economic climate in the United States continued to pose challenges for Aflac U.S. sales growth in 2010. The following table presents Aflacs U.S. new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 New annualized premium sales $ 1,382 $ 1,453 $ 1,551 Increase (decrease) over prior year (4.9 )% (6.4 )% (.4 )% The following table details the contributions to new annualized premium sales by major insurance product category for the years ended December 31. 2010 2009 2008 Accident/disability 48 % 48 % 49 % Cancer 17 18 19 Hospital indemnity 18 18 16 Life 6 6 6 Fixed benefit dental 5 5 5 Other 6 5 5 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % New annualized premium sales for accident/disability insurance, our leading product category, decreased 5.2%, cancer insurance sales decreased 10.9%, and hospital indemnity insurance sales decreased 3.2% in 2010, compared with 2009. As part of our U.S. sales strategy we continue to focus on growing and enhancing the effectiveness of our U.S. sales force. We recruited more than 22,100 new sales associates during 2010, resulting in more than 72,500 licensed sales associates at December 31, 2010. Although recruitment of sales associates in the fourth quarter of 2010 was down 8.5%, it showed significant improvement over the 25.4% decline in recruiting for the first nine months of the year, compared with the same periods in 2009. To improve our recruiting results next year and beyond, we have amended the bonus structure for our state and regional coordinators from one that was based entirely on sales results to a structure that incorporates a people development component. We have also initiated a national recruiting contest that incentivizes producer recruitment. In addition, we provide a recruiting workshop that focuses on improving coordinator productivity by emphasizing candidate sourcing, interviewing, and contract acceptance. In addition to expanding the size and capabilities of our traditional sales force, we are encouraged about the opportunities to broaden our distribution by pursuing and strengthening relationships with insurance brokers. Insurance brokers have been a historically underleveraged sales channel for Aflac, and we are developing relationships that will complement our traditional distribution system with the Aflac for BrokersSM initiative that we launched in 2009. We assembled a management team experienced in broker sales, and we are supporting this initiative with streamlined products, targeted broker specific advertising campaigns, customized enrollment technology, and competitive compensation. Additionally, a new level of management has been introduced to deliver this initiative. More than 100 broker development coordinators have been hired to be single points of contact for brokers across the country. Broker development coordinators are responsible for building relationships with new brokers as well as strengthening relationships with our current brokers. These coordinators are assisted by a team of certified case managers whose role is to coordinate and manage the account enrollments for brokers. Furthering our initiatives in the broker arena, we purchased CAIC in 2009. CAIC, now branded as Aflac Group Insurance, equips us with a platform for offering voluntary group insurance products for distribution by insurance brokers at the worksite. New annualized premium sales for Aflac U.S. in 2010 included sales from Aflac Group Insurance of $83 million. These sales of group insurance products represented 6% of total U.S. sales production. Group insurance sales from the fourth quarter of 2010 of $43 million were 58.7% higher than the same quarter in prior year and represented 51.4% of Aflac Group Insurance production for the full year. We expect group products to enhance sales opportunities not only for brokers but also for our traditional sales force of individual associates, especially when they pursue larger payroll accounts. 48 Table of Contents Although we remain cautious in our short term sales outlook for Aflac U.S., our longer term view has not changed. We believe the need for our products we sell remains strong, and that the United States provides a vast and accessible market for our products. We are taking measures to better reach potential customers through our product and distribution strategy, which includes broadening our product portfolio to include group products in addition to our traditional individually issued products. Following the passage of health care reform in 2010, we believe employers and consumers will increasingly come to understand the need for the products we offer, just as they have in Japan. For 2011, our objective is for Aflac U.S. new annualized premium sales to be flat to up 5%, however we remain cautious until we see further stability in the economy. Aflac U.S. Investments The following table presents the results of Aflacs U.S. investment yields for the years ended December 31. 2010 2009 2008 New money yield 5.82 % 7.26 % 7.60 % Return on average invested assets, net of investment expenses 6.37 6.66 6.77 The decrease in the U.S. new money yield in 2010 reflects a low level of interest rates and tightening credit spreads. At December 31, 2010, the portfolio yield on Aflacs U.S. portfolio was 6.92%, compared with 7.17% a year ago. We have $200 million of variable interest rate collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that support $200 million of variable interest rate funding agreements issued by Aflac U.S. Because these CDOs do not support our core policyholder benefit obligations, the yield on these CDOs is not included in the Aflac U.S. portfolio yield or in the yields listed in the above table. The overall credit quality of Aflac U.S. investments remained high. At the end of 2010, 95.7% of Aflac U.S. debt and perpetual securities were rated investment grade, on an amortized cost basis. See the Credit Risk section of this MD&A for additional information. See Notes 3 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Analysis of Financial Condition section of this MD&A for additional information on our investments. U.S. Economy Operating in the U.S. economy continues to be challenging. Ongoing low confidence levels from consumers and small businesses coupled with fewer employees at the worksite continue to pose challenges to our U.S. sales growth. Most of our business continues to revolve around small business owners and accounts with fewer than 100 employees. Small businesses, in particular, have proven to be especially vulnerable to ongoing economic weakness, and both small business owners and their workers are anxious about the future. Workers at small businesses are holding back on increasing their spending for voluntary insurance products. Although we believe that the weakened U.S. economy has been a contributing factor to slower sales growth, we also believe our products remain affordable to the average American consumer. We believe that consumers underlying need for our U.S. product line remains strong, and that the United States remains a sizeable and attractive market for our products. U.S. Regulatory Environment In March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to give Americans of all ages and income levels access to comprehensive major medical health insurance. The primary subject of the new legislation is major medical insurance; therefore, the PPACA, as enacted, does not directly affect the design of our insurance products or our sales model. Our experience with Japans national health care environment leads us to believe that the need for our products will only increase over the coming years. In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly known as the Dodd Frank Act, which, among other things, created a Financial Stability and Oversight Council. The Council may designate by a two thirds vote whether certain insurance companies and insurance holding companies pose a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States, in which case such nonbank 49 Table of Contents financial companies would become subject to prudential regulation by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve, including capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements and examinations. The Board may limit such companys ability to enter into merger transactions, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate one or more activities, or impose conditions on the manner in which it conducts activities. The Dodd Frank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office under the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long term care insurance and crop insurance. Traditionally, U.S. insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments. The Dodd Frank Act requires extensive rule making and other future regulatory action, which in some cases will take a period of years to implement. Despite the lack of regulations to implement this law, we believe that Aflac would not likely be considered a company that would pose a systemic risk to the financial stability of the United States. However, at the current time, it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty what impact, if any, the Dodd Frank Act will have on our U.S. business, financial condition, or results of operations. OTHER OPERATIONS Corporate operating expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation, benefits and facilities expenses. Corporate expenses, excluding investment income, were $67 million in 2010, $77 million in 2009 and $61 million in 2008. The increase in expenses in 2009 was due primarily to an increase in realized foreign currency losses on yen cash held by the Parent Company and an increase in expense for our unfunded supplemental retirement plans. Investment income included in reported corporate expenses was $11 million in 2010, $9 million in 2009 and $20 million in 2008. ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations. The yen/dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen denominated balance sheet items to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The following table demonstrates the effect of the change in the yen/dollar exchange rate by comparing select balance sheet items as reported at December 31, 2010, with the amounts that would have been reported had the exchange rate remained unchanged from December 31, 2009. Impact of Foreign Exchange on Balance Sheet Items (In millions) As Reported Exchange Effect Net ofExchange Effect Yen/dollar exchange rate(1) 81.49 92.10 Investments and cash $ 88,230 $ 8,101 $ 80,129 Deferred policy acquisition costs 9,734 802 8,932 Total assets 101,039 9,072 91,967 Policy liabilities 82,456 8,626 73,830 Total liabilities 89,983 9,103 80,880 (1) The exchange rate at December 31, 2010, was 81.49 yen to one dollar, or 13.0% stronger than the December 31, 2009, exchange rate of 92.10. Market Risks of Financial Instruments Our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while emphasizing liquidity, safety and quality. Our investment objective, subject to appropriate risk constraints, is to fund policyholder obligations and other liabilities in a manner that enhances shareholders equity. We seek to achieve this objective through a diversified portfolio of fixed income investments that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities it supports. Aflac invests primarily within the fixed income securities markets. 50 Table of Contents The following table details investment securities by segment as of December 31. Investment Securities by Segment Aflac Japan Aflac U.S. (In millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Securities available for sale, at fair value: Fixed maturities $ 39,485 $ 29,952 $ 8,750 (1) $ 6,712 (1) Perpetual securities 7,233 7,041 279 222 Equity securities 23 24 0 0 Total available for sale 46,741 37,017 9,029 6,934 Securities held to maturity, at amortized cost: Fixed maturities 30,084 26,487 0 200 Total held to maturity 30,084 26,487 0 200 Total investment securities $ 76,825 $ 63,504 $ 9,029 $ 7,134 (1) Excludes investment grade, available for sale fixed maturity securities held by the Parent Company of $120 in 2010 and $117 in 2009. Because we invest in fixed income securities, our financial instruments are exposed primarily to three types of market risks: currency risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Currency Risk The functional currency of Aflac Japans insurance operation is the Japanese yen. All of Aflac Japans premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as are most of its investment income and other expenses. Furthermore, most of Aflac Japans investments, cash and liabilities are yen denominated. When yen denominated securities mature or are sold, the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen denominated securities. Aflac Japan holds these yen denominated assets to fund its yen denominated policy obligations. In addition, Aflac Incorporated has yen denominated debt obligations. Although we generally do not convert yen into dollars, we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. Aflac Japan maintains a portfolio of reverse dual currency securities (yen denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments), which exposes Aflac to changes in foreign exchange rates. This foreign currency effect is accounted for as a component of unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities in accumulated other comprehensive income. When the yen strengthens against the dollar, shareholders equity is negatively impacted and, conversely, when the yen weakens against the dollar, shareholders equity is positively impacted. Aflac Japan invests a portion of its assets in reverse dual currency securities to provide a higher yield than those available on Japanese government or other public corporate bonds, while still adhering to prudent standards of credit quality. The yen/dollar exchange rate would have to strengthen to approximately 50 before the yield on these instruments would equal that of a comparable yen denominated instrument. On a consolidated basis, we attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders equity to foreign currency translation fluctuations. We accomplish this by investing a portion of Aflac Japans investment portfolio in dollar denominated securities and by the Parent Companys issuance of yen denominated debt (for additional information, see the discussion under Hedging Activities as follows in this section of MD&A). As a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is reduced. 51 Table of Contents The following table demonstrates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of our yen denominated assets and liabilities, and our consolidated yen denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of December 31.

Prior to the adoption of this new accounting guidance, our beneficial interest in certain VIEs was a yen denominated available for sale fixed maturity security. Upon consolidation on January 1, 2010, the original yen denominated investment was derecognized and the underlying U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturity or perpetual securities and cross currency swaps were recognized. While the combination of a U.S. dollar denominated investment and cross currency swap economically creates a yen denominated investment, these investments will create foreign currency fluctuations but have no impact on our net investment hedge position. For additional information, see the Hedging Activities subsection of MD&A. Some of the consolidated VIEs in our Aflac Japan portfolio use foreign currency swaps to convert foreign denominated cash flows to yen, the functional currency of Aflac Japan, in order to minimize cash flow fluctuations. Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be periodic exchanges of payments at specified intervals based on the agreed upon rates and notional amounts. 52 Table of Contents We are exposed to economic currency risk only when yen funds are actually converted into dollars. This primarily occurs when we repatriate funds from Aflac Japan to Aflac U.S., which is generally done annually. The exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. A portion of the repatriation may be used to service Aflac Incorporateds yen denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars. Interest Rate Risk Our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt and perpetual securities. We use a modified duration analysis modeling approach, which measures price percentage volatility, to estimate the sensitivity of the fair values of our investments to interest rate changes on the debt and perpetual securities we own. For example, if the current duration of a debt security or perpetual security is 10, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. Likewise, the fair value of the debt security or perpetual security will decrease by approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. The estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt and perpetual securities we own, interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, notes payable, and our obligation to the Japanese policyholder protection corporation as of December 31 follows: Sensitivity of Fair Values of Financial Instruments to Interest Rate Changes 2010 2009 (In millions) FairValue +100BasisPoints FairValue +100BasisPoints Assets: Debt and perpetual securities: Fixed maturity securities: Yen denominated $ 62,733 $ 55,518 $ 51,989 $ 46,199 Dollar denominated 16,091 14,764 10,620 9,668 Perpetual securities: Yen denominated 7,062 6,444 6,990 6,376 Dollar denominated 450 411 273 251 Total debt and perpetual securities $ 86,336 $ 77,137 $ 69,872 $ 62,494 Interest rate and foreign currency swaps $ 564 $ (251 ) $ 0 $ 0 Liabilities: Notes payable(1) $ (3,248 ) $ (3,060 ) $ (2,683 ) $ (2,557 ) Interest rate and foreign currency swaps (398 ) (8 ) (3 ) 0 Japanese policyholder protection corporation (108 ) (108 ) (128 ) (128 ) (1) Excludes capitalized lease obligations There are various factors that affect the fair value of our investment in debt and perpetual securities. Included in those factors are changes in the prevailing interest rate environment. Changes in the interest rate environment directly affect the balance of unrealized gains or losses for a given period in relation to a prior period. Decreases in market yields generally improve the fair value of debt and perpetual securities while increases in market yields generally have a negative impact on the fair value of our debt and perpetual securities. However, we do not expect to realize a majority of any unrealized gains or losses because we have the intent and ability to hold such securities until a recovery of value, which may be maturity. For additional information on unrealized losses on debt and perpetual securities, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 53 Table of Contents We attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. The following table presents the approximate duration of Aflac Japans yen denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of December 31.

Over the next two years, we have yen denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of Aflac Japans current net investment yield of 3.34%. These securities total $3.8 billion at amortized cost and have an average yield of 5.14%. Currently, when debt and perpetual securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, adding riders to our older policies has helped offset negative investment spreads on these policies. Overall, adequate profit margins exist in Aflac Japans aggregate block of business because of profits that have emerged from changes in the mix of business and favorable experience from mortality, morbidity and expenses. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements related to our 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes. These agreements effectively swap the variable interest rate Uridashi notes to fixed rate notes to eliminate the volatility in our interest expense. We also have interest rate swaps related to some of our consolidated VIEs. These interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts on floating rate fixed maturity securities contracts to fixed rates. For further information, see Notes 4 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 54 Table of Contents Credit Risk Our investment activities expose us to credit risk, which is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying investment positions. However, we continue to adhere to prudent standards for credit quality. We accomplish this by considering our product needs and overall corporate objectives, in addition to credit risk. In evaluating the initial rating, we look at the overall senior issuer rating, the explicit rating for the actual issue or the rating for the security class, and, where applicable, the appropriate designation from the Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). All of our securities have ratings from either a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or the SVO of the NAIC. In addition, we perform extensive internal credit reviews to ensure that we are consistent in applying rating criteria for all of our securities. We use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. Furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis. The distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the years ended December 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows: Composition of Purchases by Credit Rating 2010 2009 2008 AAA 1.0 % 7.6 % 9.9 % AA 60.7 58.9 36.4 A 24.5 31.4 42.0 BBB 13.8 2.1 11.7 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Our purchases of securities from year to year are determined based on diversification objectives, relative value and availability of investment opportunities, while meeting our investment policy guidelines for liquidity, safety and quality. We did not purchase any perpetual securities during the periods presented in the table above. The distributions of debt and perpetual securities we own, by credit rating, as of December 31 were as follows: Composition of Portfolio by Credit Rating 2010 2009 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value AAA 3.3 % 3.6 % 3.3 % 3.4 % AA 35.7 36.5 34.6 35.8 A 36.0 36.6 39.6 39.8 BBB 18.8 18.7 15.6 15.2 BB or lower 6.2 4.6 6.9 5.8 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % As of December 31, 2010, our direct and indirect exposure to securities in our investment portfolio that were guaranteed by third parties was immaterial both individually and in the aggregate. Subordination Distribution The majority of our total investments in debt and perpetual securities was senior debt at December 31, 2010, and 2009. We also maintained investments in subordinated financial instruments that primarily consisted of Lower Tier II, Upper Tier II, and Tier I securities, listed in order of seniority. The Lower Tier II (LTII) securities are debt instruments with fixed maturities. Our Upper Tier II (UTII) and Tier I investments consisted of debt instruments with fixed maturities and perpetual securities, which have an economic maturity as opposed to a stated maturity. 55 Table of Contents The following table shows the subordination distribution of our debt and perpetual securities as of December 31.

Investment Concentrations As of December 31, 2010, our largest investment industry sector concentration was banks and financial institutions. Throughout 2008 and during the first half of 2009, concerns related to troubled residential mortgages in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe spread to structured investment securities. As a result, banks and financial institutions suffered significant write downs of asset values, which pressured banks and financial institutions to seek capital and liquidity support. National governments responded with various forms of support, ranging from guarantees on new and existing debt to significant injections of capital. In the second half of 2009, asset valuations generally improved, and banks and other institutions continued to use exchanges and tender offers to enhance their core capital. However, 2010 brought new concerns about the fiscal integrity of peripheral European sovereign nations. As a result, Greece and Ireland were forced to accept external funding aid in various forms to meet their financial obligations, as public markets were not accessible. The financial institutions of these countries have faced both liquidity and asset valuation pressures. Nationalization and or recapitalization, along with loss sharing among bondholders, all remain distinct risks for financial institutions in these countries and others facing similar fiscal pressures. While European politicians have become increasingly hesitant to put taxpayers at risk, with few exceptions, nationalizations and burden sharing among debt holders remain options of last resort as governments try to remain generally supportive of the classes of investments that we own. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our investment discipline, further discussion of our largest investment industry sector concentration (banks and financial institutions), and disclosure on our investment exposure to certain Eurozone countries (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain). 56 Table of Contents Our largest global investment exposures as of December 31, 2010, were as follows: Largest Global Investment Positions Ratings (In millions) AmortizedCost % of Total Seniority Moodys S&P Fitch Japan National Government(1) $ 16,342 19.0 % Senior Aa2 AA AA Israel Electric Corp. 990 1.2 Senior Baa2 BB+ Republic of Tunisia 936 1.1 Senior Baa2 BBB BBB HSBC Holdings PLC 821 1.0 HSBC Finance Corporation (formerly Household Finance) 639 .7 Senior A3 A AA Republic New York Corp. 11 LTII A2 A+ AA HSBC Holdings PLC 15 UTII A1 A AA HSBC Bank PLC (RAV Intl.

Included in our largest global investment holdings are legacy positions that date back many years. Additionally, the concentration of certain of our holdings of individual credit exposures has grown over time through merger and consolidation activity. Beginning in 2005, we have generally limited our investment exposures to issuers to no more than 5% of total adjusted capital (TAC) on a statutory accounting basis, with the exception of obligations of the Japanese and U.S. governments. However, existing investment exposures that exceeded 5% of TAC at the time this guidance was adopted, or exposures that may exceed this threshold from time to time through merger and consolidation activity, are not automatically reduced through sales of the issuers securities but rather are reduced over time consistent with our investment policy. We have investments in both publicly and privately issued securities. The outstanding amount of a particular issuance, as well as the level of activity in a particular issuance and market conditions, including credit events and the interest rate environment, affect liquidity regardless of whether it is publicly or privately issued. The following table details investment securities by type of issuance as of December 31.

Aflac Japans investments in yen denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non Japanese issuers and have longer maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our asset/liability matching and our overall investment returns. Most of our privately issued securities are issued under medium term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings of the issuer, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and or event risk covenants are required. Below Investment Grade and Split Rated Securities In the event of a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade status, we do not automatically liquidate our position. However, if the security is in the held to maturity portfolio and we no longer have the intent to hold the security until its maturity, we immediately transfer it to the available for sale portfolio so that the securitys fair value and its unrealized gain or loss are reflected on the balance sheet. Debt and perpetual securities classified as below investment grade at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were generally reported as available for sale and carried at fair value. Each of the below investment grade securities was investment grade at the time of purchase and was subsequently downgraded by credit rating agencies. Below investment grade debt and perpetual securities represented 6.2% of total debt and perpetual securities at December 31, 2010, compared with 6.9% of total debt and perpetual securities at December 31, 2009, at amortized cost. 59 Table of Contents The below investment grade securities at December 31 were as follows: Below Investment Grade Securities 2010 2009 (In millions) ParValue AmortizedCost Fair Value UnrealizedGain/Loss ParValue AmortizedCost FairValue UnrealizedGain/Loss Investcorp Capital Limited $ 504 $ 504 $ 337 $ (167 ) $ 452 $ 452 $ 223 $ (229 ) Irish Life and Permanent PLC(1) 454 112 112 0 402 204 197 (7 ) Lloyds Banking Group PLC (includes HBOS in 2009)(1) 440 364 387 23 896 597 612 15 EFG Eurobank Ergasias 417 416 131 (285 ) * * * * UPM Kymmene 380 380 290 (90 ) 337 337 224 (113 ) Ford Motor Credit Company 368 368 374 6 326 326 302 (24 ) NBG (National Bank of Greece) 368 368 146 (222 ) * * * * Alpha Bank 368 368 115 (253 ) * * * * Dexia SA (includes Dexia Bank Belgium & Dexia Overseas)(1) 368 264 186 (78 ) 326 233 233 0 Swedbank(1) 356 299 314 15 152 117 119 2 CSAV (Tollo Shipping Co.

This occurs when one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade. Our policy is to review each issue on a case by case basis to determine if a split rated security should be classified as investment grade or below investment grade. Our review includes evaluating the issuers credit position as well as current market pricing and other factors, such as the issuers or securitys inclusion on a credit rating downgrade watch list. Split rated securities totaled $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, 60 Table of Contents and represented 3% of total debt and perpetual securities, at amortized cost, during each of those years.

However, we believe it would be inappropriate to recognize impairment charges because we believe the changes in fair value are temporary. Investment Valuation and Cash We estimate the fair values of our securities available for sale on a monthly basis. We monitor the estimated fair values obtained from our custodian and pricing brokers and those derived from our discounted cash flow pricing model for consistency from month to month, while considering current market conditions. We also periodically discuss with our custodian and pricing brokers the pricing techniques they use to monitor the consistency of their approach and periodically assess the appropriateness of the valuation level assigned to the values obtained from them. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair value hierarchy classification of our securities available for sale as of December 31, 2010. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.1 billion, or 2.4% of total investments and cash, as of December 31, 2010, compared with $2.3 billion, or 3.2%, at December 31, 2009. For a discussion of the factors causing the change in our cash balance, see the Operating Activities, Investing Activities and Financing Activities sections of this MD&A. For additional information concerning our investments, see Notes 3, 4, and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 62 Table of Contents Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs The following table presents deferred policy acquisition costs by segment for the years ended December 31.

The increase in Aflac Japans deferred policy acquisition costs was primarily driven by the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar and new annualized premium sales. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our deferred policy acquisition costs. Policy Liabilities The following table presents policy liabilities by segment for the years ending December 31. (In millions) 2010 2009 % Change Aflac Japan $ 74,872 $ 62,055 20.7 %(1) Aflac U.S. 7,581 7,187 5.5 Other 3 3 .0 Total $ 82,456 $ 69,245 19.1 % (1) Aflac Japans policy liabilities increased 6.8% in yen during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in Aflac Japans policy liabilities was primarily the result of the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar and the growth and aging of our in force business. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our policy liabilities. Notes Payable Notes payable totaled $3.0 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.6 billion at December 31, 2009. In August 2010, we issued $450 million and $300 million in senior notes that are due in August 2040 and August 2015, respectively. In July 2010, we paid $447 million to redeem 39.4 billion yen of our Samurai notes upon their maturity. The ratio of debt to total capitalization (debt plus shareholders equity, excluding the unrealized gains and losses on investment securities and derivatives) was 21.7% as of December 31, 2010, compared with 22.3% a year ago. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our notes payable. Benefit Plans Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. have various benefit plans. For additional information on our Japanese and U.S. plans, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Policyholder Protection Corporation The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. On December 12, 2008, legislation was enacted extending the framework of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC), which included government fiscal measures supporting the LIPPC through March 2012. Hedging Activities Net Investment Hedge Our primary exposure to be hedged is our investment in Aflac Japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. To mitigate this exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. First, Aflac Japan 63 Table of Contents maintains a portfolio of dollar denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in Aflac Japan. Second, we have designated the Parent Companys yen denominated liabilities (Samurai and Uridashi notes and yen denominated loans) as a hedge of our investment in Aflac Japan. At the beginning of each quarter, we make our net investment hedge designation. If the total of our designated yen denominated liabilities is equal to or less than our net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective and the related exchange effect is reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. Should these designated yen denominated liabilities exceed our investment in Aflac Japan, the foreign exchange effect on the portion of the liabilities that exceeds our investment in Aflac Japan would be recognized in net earnings. We estimate that if our yen denominated liabilities exceeded our investment in Aflac Japan by 10 billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every 1% yen weakening/strengthening in the end of period yen/dollar exchange rate. For hedge designation purposes, Aflac Japan yen denominated net assets exceeded the Parent Companys designated yen denominated liabilities at the beginning of each of the quarters in 2010. As a result, our net investment hedge was effective during the year ended December 31, 2010, and therefore there was no impact on net earnings during the year. We recognized an immaterial loss in net earnings during the second quarter of 2009 for the negative foreign exchange effect on the Parent Company yen denominated liabilities that exceeded our yen net asset position in Aflac Japan. Our net investment hedge was effective during the other quarters of 2009 and the full year ended December 31, 2008; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings during those periods. Starting in 2010, the yen net asset figure calculated for hedging purposes differs from the yen denominated net asset position as discussed in the Currency Risk subsection of MD&A. As disclosed in that subsection, the consolidation of the underlying assets in certain VIEs on January 1, 2010, required that we derecognize our yen denominated investment in the VIE and recognize the underlying U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturity or perpetual securities and cross currency swaps. While these U.S. dollar investments will create foreign currency fluctuations, the combination of the U.S. dollar denominated investment and the cross currency swap economically creates a yen denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of our investment in Aflac Japan. The dollar values of our yen denominated net assets, including certain VIEs as yen denominated investments for net investment hedging purposes as discussed above, are summarized as follows (translated at end of period exchange rates) for the years ended December 31: (In millions) 2010 2009 Aflac Japan yen denominated net assets $ 3,282 $ 2,736 Parent Company yen denominated net liabilities (1,041 ) (962 ) Consolidated yen denominated net assets (liabilities) subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations $ 2,241 $ 1,774 The increase in our yen denominated net asset position was due primarily to the strengthening of the yen and improvement in the fair values of Aflac Japans investments. Cash Flow Hedges Effective January 1, 2010, as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance and the corresponding consolidation of additional VIEs, we have freestanding derivative instruments that are reported in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and are reported in other assets and other liabilities. Several of these freestanding derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, including interest rate and foreign currency swaps. Interest rate and foreign currency swaps are used within VIEs to hedge the risk arising from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, respectively. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in current period earnings as net realized investment gains and losses. While an immaterial amount of ineffectiveness was recorded during 2010, these hedging relationships were effective during the year ended December 31, 2010. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We have interest rate swap agreements related to the 20 billion yen variable interest rate Uridashi notes. By entering into these contracts, we have been able to lock in our interest rate at 1.52% in yen. We have designated 64 Table of Contents these interest rate swaps as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate Uridashi notes. The notional amounts and terms of the swaps match the principal amount and terms of the variable interest rate Uridashi notes, and the swaps had no value at inception. GAAP requires that the change in the fair value of the swap contracts be recorded in other comprehensive income so long as the hedge is deemed effective. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in net earnings. This hedge was effective during the three year period ended December 31, 2010; therefore, there was no impact on net earnings. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2010, we had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on material unconditional purchase obligations that are not recorded on our balance sheet. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent Company through dividends and management fees. The following table presents the amounts provided for the years ended December 31: Liquidity Provided by Aflac to Parent Company (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Dividends declared or paid by Aflac $ 370 $ 464 $ 1,062 Management fees paid by Aflac 205 124 71 The primary uses of cash by the Parent Company are shareholder dividends, the repurchase of its common stock and interest on its outstanding indebtedness. The Parent Companys sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not expected to change materially in the future. For additional information, see the Financing Activities subsection of this MD&A. The Parent Company also accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital. In March 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue an indefinite amount of senior and subordinated debt, in one or more series, from time to time through May 2012. We issued $450 million and $300 million of senior notes in August 2010, $400 million of senior notes in December 2009, and $850 million of senior notes in May 2009, under this registration statement. In November 2009, we filed an additional shelf registration statement with Japanese regulatory authorities that allows us to issue up to 100 billion yen of yen denominated Samurai notes in Japan (approximately $1.2 billion, using the December 31, 2010, exchange rate) through November 2011. If issued, these Samurai notes would not be available to U.S. persons. We believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income. The primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are policy claims, commissions, operating expenses, income taxes and payments to the Parent Company for management fees and dividends. Both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable. When making an investment decision, our first consideration is based on product needs. Our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment grade debt securities. These objectives also take into account duration matching, and because of the long term nature of our business, we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs. As a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. Therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. We expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses. 65 Table of Contents Our financial statements adequately convey our financing arrangements during the periods presented. We have not engaged in material intra period short term financings during the periods presented that are not otherwise reported in our balance sheet. We do not have any restrictive financial covenants related to our notes payable, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable at December 31, 2010. We have not entered into transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase financial assets that have been accounted for as a sale under applicable accounting standards, including securities lending transactions. See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our securities lending accounting policy and activity. We do not have a known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that would reasonably result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing by a material amount. Our cash and cash equivalents include unrestricted cash on hand, money market instruments, and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased, all of which has minimal market, settlement or other risk exposure. The following table presents the estimated payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. We translated our yen denominated obligations using the December 31, 2010, exchange rate. Actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.

(1) Liability amounts are those reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010. (2) Not applicable The distribution of payments for future policy benefits is an estimate of all future benefit payments for policies in force as of December 31, 2010. These projected values contain assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality and morbidity. The distribution of payments for unpaid policy claims includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. Actual amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above. We anticipate that the future policy benefit liability of $72.1 billion at December 31, 2010, along with future net premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund future policy benefit payments. The distribution of payments due in less than one year for long term debt consists of 35 billion yen for our Uridashi notes ($429 million at the December 31, 2010, exchange rate) that are due in September 2011. We plan to use existing cash to redeem these notes. For more information on our major contractual obligations, see the applicable Note in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated in the line items in the table above. 66 Table of Contents Consolidated Cash Flows We translate cash flows for Aflac Japans yen denominated items into U.S. dollars using weighted average exchange rates. In years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. The following table summarizes consolidated cash flows by activity for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Operating activities $ 6,989 $ 6,161 $ 4,965 Investing activities (7,432 ) (5,476 ) (4,283 ) Financing activities 161 699 (1,383 ) Exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents 80 (2 ) 79 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (202 ) $ 1,382 $ (622 ) Operating Activities Consolidated cash flow from operations increased 13% in 2010, compared with 2009. The following table summarizes operating cash flows by source for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Aflac Japan $ 6,327 $ 5,177 $ 4,225 Aflac U.S. and other operations 662 984 740 Total $ 6,989 $ 6,161 $ 4,965 The increase in Aflac Japan operating cash flows during 2010 was due primarily to the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar. Despite an overall increase in 2010, Aflac U.S. operating cash flows have been reduced by the payout of lump sum return of premium benefits to policyholders on a closed block of U.S. cancer insurance business. These benefit payouts began in 2008 and will conclude in 2012. We paid out $104 million in 2010, $152 million in 2009, and $63 million in 2008, and we anticipate paying out an additional $109 million over the next two years. Investing Activities Operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase debt securities to meet future policy obligations. The following table summarizes investing cash flows by source for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Aflac Japan $ (6,221 ) $ (5,156 ) $ (3,874 ) Aflac U.S. and other operations (1,211 ) (320 ) (409 ) Total $ (7,432 ) $ (5,476 ) $ (4,283 ) Prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. Currently, when our debt and perpetual securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, the long term nature of our business and our strong cash flows provide us with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. When market opportunities arise, we dispose of selected debt and perpetual securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and or rebalance our portfolio. As a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year. Dispositions before maturity were approximately 7% of the annual average investment portfolio of debt and perpetual securities available for sale during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with 12% in 2009 and 4% in 2008. The decrease in dispositions before maturity in 2010 was due primarily to a bond swap program that we executed in 2009 to generate investment gains to take advantage of tax loss carryforwards. 67 Table of Contents Financing Activities Consolidated cash provided by financing activities was $161 million in 2010 and $699 million in 2009, compared with consolidated cash used by financing activities of $1.4 billion in 2008. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends and treasury stock purchases was $656 million in 2010, compared with $524 million of dividends in 2009 and $1.9 billion of dividends and treasury stock purchases in 2008. In August 2010, the Parent Company issued $450 million and $300 million in senior notes that are due in August 2040 and August 2015, respectively. In July 2010, we paid $447 million to redeem 39.4 billion yen of our Samurai notes upon their maturity. In December 2009, the Parent Company issued $400 million in senior notes that are due in December 2039, and in May 2009, issued $850 million in senior notes that are due in May 2019. In April 2009, we redeemed our $450 million senior notes and settled the related cross currency, interest rate swaps that were used to convert the original dollar denominated debt obligation into yen. In August 2009, the Parent Company executed a 5 billion yen loan that is due in August 2015. In July 2009, the Parent Company executed a 10 billion yen loan that is due in July 2015. During 2009, we extinguished portions of our yen denominated Uridashi and Samurai debt by buying the notes on the open market. We paid 4.4 billion yen to extinguish 6.0 billion yen of debt, yielding a realized gain from extinguishment of debt of 1.6 billion yen, or $17 million ($11 million after tax), which we included in other income. In September 2011, 35 billion yen (approximately $430 million using the December 31, 2010, exchange rate) of our Uridashi notes will mature. We plan to use existing cash to redeem these notes. The following tables present a summary of treasury stock activity during the years ended December 31. Treasury Stock Purchased (In millions of dollars and thousands of shares) 2010 2009 2008 Treasury stock purchases $ 121 $ 10 $ 1,490 Number of shares purchased: Open market 2,000 0 23,201 Other 192 264 146 Total shares purchased 2,192 264 23,347 Treasury Stock Issued (In millions of dollars and thousands of shares) 2010 2009 2008 Stock issued from treasury $ 45 $ 17 $ 32 Number of shares issued 1,834 1,043 2,001 We resumed our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2010 and purchased 2.0 million shares of our common stock on the open market. During 2009, we did not repurchase any shares, and in 2008, under share repurchase authorizations from our board of directors, we repurchased 23.2 million shares of our common stock in the open market. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. As of December 31, 2010, a remaining balance of 30.4 million shares of our common stock was available for purchase under share repurchase authorizations by our board of directors. The 30.4 million shares available for purchase were comprised of .4 million shares remaining from an authorization from the board of directors in 2006 and 30.0 million shares remaining from a board authorization in 2008. We anticipate repurchasing six to 12 million shares of our common stock in 2011. 68 Table of Contents Cash dividends paid to shareholders in 2010 of $1.14 per share increased 1.8% over 2009. The 2009 dividend paid of $1.12 per share increased 16.7% over 2008. The following table presents the sources of dividends to shareholders for the years ended December 31. (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Dividends paid in cash $ 535 $ 524 $ 434 Dividends declared but not paid 0 (131 ) 131 Dividends through issuance of treasury shares 0 0 20 Total dividends to shareholders $ 535 $ 393 $ 585 In February 2011, the board of directors declared the first quarter 2011 cash dividend of $.30 per share. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2011. Regulatory Restrictions Aflac is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to its regulations. The Nebraska insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company. The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end. In addition, the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. These regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by Aflac to the Parent Company. A life insurance companys statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the NAIC, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance companys state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from GAAP and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. The continued long term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations. Aflacs insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings. The NAICs risk based capital (RBC) formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. The RBC formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurers operations. Aflacs company action level RBC ratio was 555% as of December 31, 2010. Aflacs RBC ratio remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. As of December 31, 2010, Aflacs total adjusted capital exceeded the amounts to achieve a company action level RBC of 400% and 350% by $1.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the impact of permitted practices by the Nebraska Department of Insurance on our statutory capital and surplus. Currently, the NAIC has ongoing regulatory initiatives relating to revisions to the RBC formula as well as numerous initiatives covering insurance products, investments, and other actuarial and accounting matters. In addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by U.S. insurance regulators, Japans FSA may not allow profit repatriations from Aflac Japan if the transfers would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders. The FSA maintains its own solvency standard. As of December 31, 2010, Aflac Japans solvency margin ratio was 897.5%, which significantly exceeded regulatory minimums.
