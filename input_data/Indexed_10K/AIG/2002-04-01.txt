ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION This Annual Report and other publicly available documents may include, and AIGs officers and representatives may from time to time make, statements which may constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only AIGs belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of AIGs control. These statements may address, among other things, AIGs strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market position, financial results and reserves. It is possible that AIGs actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause AIGs actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those in the specific forward looking statements are discussed throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. AIG is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligations to) update or alter any forward looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. OPERATIONAL REVIEW On August 29, 2001, American General Corporation (AGC), was acquired by AIG. In connection with the acquisition, AIG issued approximately 290 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of AGC based on an exchange ratio of 0.5790 of a share of AIG common stock for each share of AGC common stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests and the accompanying financial statements have been prepared to retroactively combine AGCs financial statements with AIGs financial statements. On January 1, 1999, SunAmerica Inc., merged with and into AIG. AIG issued 187.5 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock and Class B stock of SunAmerica Inc., based on an exchange ratio of 0.855 shares of AIG common stock for each share of SunAmerica Inc. stock. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests. AIG considers among its most important accounting policies those policies with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts, deferred policy acquisition costs, and fair value with respect to certain assets and liabilities of certain of the subsidiaries of AIGs financial services operations. These are the policies that require managements most significant exercise of judgment on both a quantitative and qualitative basis. Further explanation of how management exercises that judgment is included throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis and in the relevant footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AIGs net income decreased 19.2 percent to $5.36 billion in 2001 as a result of the impact of the following charges: (a) $1.38 billion net of tax with respect to acquisition, restructuring and related charges in connection with the acquisition of AGC (see the discussions under "Other Operations" herein and Note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements); and (b) $533 million after taxes and minority interest share in World Trade Center and related losses (WTC losses) incurred in 2001 (see the discussions under "General Insurance Operations" and "Life Insurance Operations" herein and Note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements). Excluding from AIGs net income these charges, the cumulative effect of accounting changes, realized capital gains and losses and AGCs home services operating income, which is being managed as a "closed block", core income increased 13.0 percent to $7.67 billion in 2001, due to increased growth and profitability in AIGs major businesses, including General Insurance, Life Insurance and Financial Services Operations. The following table presents the reconciliation between net income as reported and core income for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: (in millions) 2001 2000 1999 Net income, as reported $5,363 $6,639 $6,186 Cumulative effect of accounting changes 136 Acquisition related charges 1,385 207 WTC losses 533 Less: Realized capital gains (losses) (542) (214) 45 Home services operating income 293 274 283 Core income $7,666 $6,786 $5,858 GENERAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS AIGs general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. Domestic general insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG), which includes The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company (HSB); Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic); Personal Lines, including 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century), and Mortgage Guaranty. HSB was acquired on November 22, 2000 and consolidated into AIGs financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2000. This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. 18 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries DBG is AIGs primary domestic division. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance, accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG with the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. Transatlantic offers reinsurance capacity, both domestically and overseas, on treaty and facultative bases. Transatlantic structures traditional and non traditional programs for a full range of property and casualty products with an emphasis on specialty risk. Personal Lines engages in the mass marketing of personal lines insurance, primarily private passenger auto, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages. Mortgage Guaranty provides guaranty insurance primarily on conventional first mortgage loans on single family dwellings and condominiums. AIGs Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIGs foreign based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General insurance group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in over 70 countries in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. (See also Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.) General insurance operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were as follows: (in millions) 2001 2000 1999 Net premiums written: Domestic General DBG (a) $ 10,197 $ 7,934 $ 7,526 Transatlantic 1,906 1,659 1,499 Personal Lines 2,454 2,510 2,162 Mortgage Guaranty 494 453 397 Foreign General (a) 5,050 4,970 4,640 Total $ 20,101 $ 17,526 $ 16,224 Net premiums earned: Domestic General DBG (a) $ 9,776 $ 8,023 $ 7,002 Transatlantic 1,790 1,632 1,485 Personal Lines 2,478 2,401 2,079 Mortgage Guaranty 489 452 396 Foreign General (a) 4,832 4,899 4,582 Total $ 19,365 $ 17,407 $ 15,544 Adjusted underwriting profit (loss): Domestic General DBG (a) (b) $ (338) $ 177 $ 56 Transatlantic (b) (274) 1 (77) Personal Lines (92) (37) 76 Mortgage Guaranty 311 270 225 Foreign General (a) (b) 481 374 389 Total $ 88 $ 785 $ 669 Net investment income: Domestic General DBG $ 1,827 $ 1,614 $ 1,563 Transatlantic 240 234 230 Personal Lines 114 113 113 Mortgage Guaranty 106 93 76 Intercompany adjustments and eliminations net 23 77 68 Foreign General 583 570 467 Total $ 2,893 $ 2,701 $ 2,517 Operating income before realized capital gains (losses): Domestic General DBG (a) (b) $ 1,489 $ 1,791 $ 1,619 Transatlantic (b) (34) 235 153 Personal Lines 22 76 189 Mortgage Guaranty 417 363 301 Intercompany adjustments and eliminations net 23 77 68 Foreign General (a) (b) 1,064 944 856 Total 2,981 3,486 3,186 Realized capital gains (losses) (130) 38 295 Operating income (b) $ 2,851 $ 3,524 $ 3,481 (a) Reflects the realignment of certain internal divisions in each year. (b) 2001 includes WTC losses of $769 million in the aggregate. In AIGs general insurance operations, 2001 net premiums written and net premiums earned increased 14.7 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively, from those of 2000. During 2001, AIG cancelled or non renewed approximately $571 million of business worldwide that did not meet AIGs underwriting standards. In 2000, net premiums written increased 8.0 percent and net premiums earned increased 12.0 percent when compared to 1999. 19 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Commencing in the latter part of 1999 and continuing through 2001, the commercial property casualty market place has experienced rate increases. Virtually all areas of DBG have experienced rate increases. Overall, DBGs net premiums written increased $2.26 billion or 28.5 percent in 2001 over 2000. These increases compared to an increase of $408 million or 5.4 percent in 2000 over 1999. Personal Lines net premiums written decreased 2.2 percent or $56 million in 2001 over 2000, compared to an increase of 16.1 percent or $348 million in 2000 over 1999. Foreign general insurance net premiums written increased 1.6 percent and net premiums earned decreased 1.4 percent. Foreign general insurance operations produced 25.1 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in 2001, 28.4 percent in 2000 and 28.6 percent in 1999. In comparing the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of AIGs foreign general operations during 2001 to those foreign currency exchange rates used to translate AIGs foreign general results during 2000, the U.S. dollar strengthened in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts business. Accordingly, when foreign net premiums written were translated into U.S. dollars for the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, total general insurance net premiums written were approximately 2.8 percentage points less than they would have been if translated utilizing those foreign currency exchange rates which prevailed during 2000. Because of the nature and diversity of AIGs operations and the continuing rapid changes in the insurance industry worldwide, together with the factors discussed above, it is difficult to assess further or project future growth in AIGs net premiums written and reserve for losses and loss expenses. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned primarily on a pro rata basis over the term of the related coverage. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. AIG, along with most general insurance entities, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe for every $100 of net premiums earned or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses, respectively. The combined ratio presents the total cost per $100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. The statutory general insurance ratios, including WTC losses in 2001, were as follows: 2001 2000 1999 Domestic General: Loss Ratio 85.89 80.99 81.61 Expense Ratio 17.64 17.39 16.95 Combined Ratio 103.53 98.38 98.56 Foreign General: Loss Ratio 60.51 60.71 60.91 Expense Ratio 31.67 31.69 30.54 Combined Ratio 92.18 92.40 91.45 Consolidated: Loss Ratio 79.55 75.28 75.51 Expense Ratio 21.16 21.45 20.84 Combined Ratio 100.71 96.73 96.35 AIG believes that underwriting profit is the true measure of the performance of the core business of a general insurance company. Underwriting profit is measured in two ways: statutory underwriting profit and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) underwriting profit. Statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred. Statutory accounting differs from GAAP, as statutory accounting requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for statutory purposes, all expenses, most specifically acquisition expenses, are recognized immediately, not consistent with the revenues earned. A basic premise of GAAP accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned, the principle of matching. Therefore, to convert underwriting results to a GAAP basis, acquisition expenses are deferred and recognized over the period the related premiums written are earned. Accordingly, the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by GAAP. Thus, "adjusted underwriting profit" is a GAAP measurement which can be viewed as gross margin or an intermediate subtotal in calculating operating income and net income. A major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, exclusive of investment income. If underwriting is not profitable, losses incurred are a major factor. The result is that the premiums are inadequate to pay for losses and expenses and produce a profit; therefore, investment income must be used to cover underwriting losses. If assets and the income therefrom are insufficient to pay claims and expenses over extended periods, an insurance company cannot survive. For these reasons, AIG views and manages its underwriting operations separately from its investment operations.(See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) 20 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The adjusted underwriting profits were $88 million in 2001, $785 million in 2000 and $669 million in 1999. When WTC losses in 2001 are excluded from losses incurred, the adjusted underwriting profit would be $857 million for 2001, a 9.2 percent increase over 2000. This increase was primarily due to the domestic adjusted underwriting profit resulting from the disciplined underwriting of DBG. The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct impact on pricing and consequently profitability as reflected by adjusted underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios. (See also Notes 4 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.) AIGs results reflect the net impact of incurred losses from catastrophes approximating $867 million in 2001 (which include $769 million in WTC losses and $50 million with respect to the Northridge earthquake, following the unprecedented decision by the State of California to require all insurers to reopen claims nearly eight years after the occurrence), $44 million in 2000 and $156 million in 1999. AIGs gross incurred losses from catastrophes approximated $2.15 billion in 2001 (which include $2.0 billion in WTC losses), $112 million in 2000 and $472 million in 1999. While AIG believes that it has taken appropriate steps to reduce the magnitude of possible future losses, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity, such as a terrorist attack, earthquake or hurricane, that causes insured losses could have a material adverse effect on AIGs results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. Current techniques and models may not accurately predict in the future the probability of catastrophic events and the extent of the resulting losses. Moreover, one or more catastrophe losses could impact negatively AIGs reinsurers and result in an inability of AIG to collect reinsurance recoverables. The impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to year, making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult. The pro forma table below excludes catastrophe losses in order to present comparable results of AIGs recurring core underwriting operations. The pro forma consolidated statutory general insurance ratios would be as follows: 2001 2000 1999 Loss Ratio 75.08 75.03 74.51 Expense Ratio 21.16 21.45 20.84 Combined Ratio 96.24 96.48 95.35 AIGs historic ability to maintain its combined ratio below 100 is primarily attributable to the profitability of AIGs foreign general insurance operations and AIGs emphasis on maintaining its disciplined underwriting, especially in the domestic specialty markets. In addition, AIG does not seek premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures. General insurance net investment income in 2001 increased 7.1 percent when compared to 2000. In 2000, net investment income increased 7.3 percent over 1999. The growth in net investment income in each of the three years was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment. The new cash flow was generated from net general insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein and Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.) General insurance realized capital losses were $130 million in 2001, and realized capital gains were $38 million in 2000 and $295 million in 1999. These realized gains and losses resulted from the ongoing investment management of the general insurance portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities. General insurance operating income in 2001 decreased 19.1 percent when compared to 2000 primarily due to the WTC losses. Estimated WTC losses recorded in 2001 amounted to $769 million, including $200 million from Transatlantic. Adjusted general insurance operating income, which excludes WTC losses, as well as realized capital losses, increased 7.6 percent to $3.75 billion during 2001. General insurance operating income in 2000 increased 1.3 percent when compared to 1999. The contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and excluding acquisition, restructuring and related charges was 28.1 percent in 2001 compared to 34.1 percent in 2000 and 37.0 percent in 1999. AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs. AIG insures risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. These reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds. AIGs general reinsurance assets amounted to $27.65 billion and resulted from AIGs reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 2001 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 2001, approximately 43 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers. In order to obtain statutory recognition, nearly all of these balances were collateralized. The remaining 57 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 97 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated A (excellent) or better, as rated by 21 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) A.M. Best. This rating is a measure of financial strength. The terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories, not creditworthiness. Approximately $1.2 billion of the $2.0 billion in gross WTC losses is covered by reinsurance, with approximately 99 percent of this coverage placed with companies that are rated A or better. AIG maintains an allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance and has been largely successful in its previous recovery efforts. At December 31, 2001, AIG had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating $75 million. At that date AIG had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled (e.g., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction). AIGs Reinsurance Security Department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. Such assessments include, but are not limited to, identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, and has sufficient financial capacity, and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. This department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral. In addition, AIGs Credit Risk Committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer. AIG enters into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for its general and life operations. AIG enters these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. At December 31, 2001, the consolidated general reinsurance assets of $27.65 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of $3.82 billion and $18.90 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses, including ceded losses incurred but not reported (IBNR) (ceded reserves). The ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments therefrom are reflected in income currently. It is AIGs belief that the ceded reserves at December 31, 2001 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded. At December 31, 2001, general insurance reserves for losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) amounted to $44.79 billion. These loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR, and loss expenses and amounts of discounting primarily related to certain workers compensation claims. At December 31, 2001, general insurance net loss reserves increased $944 million from prior year end to $25.90 billion. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently. It is managements belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2001. While AIG continually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIGs ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially exceed AIGs loss reserves as of December 31, 2001. In the future, if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on results of operations. In a very broad sense, the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups: one group being long tail casualty lines of business. Such lines include excess and umbrella liability, directors and officers liability, professional liability, medical malpractice, general liability, products liability, and related classes. These lines account for approximately one half of net losses and loss expenses. The other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines, personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines. Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. In the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses. That is, a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. A relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be IBNR. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximated four percent. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms and current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs. Therefore, AIGs carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business. In the evaluation of AIGs net loss reserves, loss trend factors vary slightly, depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines. Loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the 22 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries growth in exposure of such lines. For example, if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property, the growth in propertys exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased. For other property and short tail casualty lines, the loss trend is implicitly assumed to grow at the rate that reported net losses grow from one year to the next. The concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. AIG has established a specialized claims unit which investigates and adjusts all such asbestos and environmental claims. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage. However, AIG currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and has excluded such claims from the analyses included herein. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process. These asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described. Quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment. Significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involves issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties. In the interim, AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues. At the current time, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims. Such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage issues. Although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims, the reserves carried for these claims at December 31, 2001 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law. Furthermore, as AIGs net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years, the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves. In the future, if the environmental claims develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations. (See the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein.) The majority of AIGs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case basis. 23 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) A summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 follows.

Best, an insurance rating agency, has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that companys current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments. This is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years. Therefore, the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments. The higher the ratio, the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments. These ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year. Such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments. It should be noted, however, that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves, ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio. The developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments. Involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments, court orders, covered claims with no coverage defenses, state mandated cleanup costs, claims where AIGs coverage defenses are minimal, and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting. Also, AIG considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary. AIG believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio. The special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages AIGs asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites. As a result, AIG reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies. AIGs survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, were based upon a three year average payment. These ratios for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were as follows: GROSS NET 2001 Involuntary survival ratios: Asbestos 3.3 4.3 Environmental 18.7 16.5 Combined 6.8 8.7 2000 Involuntary survival ratios: Asbestos 3.6 6.8 Environmental 20.0 16.9 Combined 7.6 11.5 1999 Involuntary survival ratios: Asbestos 4.1 6.3 Environmental 17.3 17.5 Combined 8.2 11.7 AIGs operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities. Therefore, the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated. The guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $24 million, $15 million and $15 million, respectively. AIG is also required to participate in various involuntary pools (principally workers compensation business) which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets. This participation is also recorded upon notification, as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated. 25 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) LIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS AIGs life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life and pensions. AIGs three principal overseas life operations are American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), American International Assurance Company, Limited together with American International Assurance Company (Bermuda) Limited (AIA) and Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan). ALICO is incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIA operates primarily in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. AIGs domestic life operations sell financial and investment type products, as well as traditional life products. (See also Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.) Life insurance premium income presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was as follows: (in millions) 2001 2000 1999 Premium income: Domestic $ 4,950 $ 4,818 $ 4,485 Foreign 14,293 12,355 10,995 Total $19,243 $17,173 $15,480 Life insurance operations presented on a major product basis for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were as follows: (in millions) 2001 2000 1999 Premium income, deposits and other considerations: Domestic: Life/Mass Marketing $ 4,532 $ 4,127 $ 4,154 Fixed Annuity/Pension 18,867 14,250 12,719 Accident & Health (a) 157 327 289 Total Domestic 23,556 18,704 17,162 Foreign: Ordinary 16,058 16,073 12,712 Personal Accident 2,173 1,923 1,630 Group Life/Medical 952 796 780 Group Pension 712 470 384 Individual Annuity 578 655 286 Total Foreign 20,473 19,917 15,792 Total premium income, deposits and other considerations $ 44,029 $ 38,621 $ 32,954 Net investment income: Domestic: Life/Mass Marketing $ 2,101 $ 2,067 $ 2,034 Fixed Annuity/Pension 5,977 5,392 4,754 Accident & Health (a) 5 8 8 Total Domestic 8,083 7,467 6,796 Foreign: Ordinary 3,150 2,762 2,298 Personal Accident 128 130 115 Group Life/Medical 46 46 44 Group Pension 182 177 193 Individual Annuity 157 91 67 Eliminations (11) (9) (8) Total Foreign 3,652 3,197 2,709 Total net investment income $ 11,735 $ 10,664 $ 9,505 Operating income before realized capital losses: Domestic: Life/Mass Marketing $ 1,110 $ 1,109 $ 1,035 Fixed Annuity/Pension 1,806 1,614 1,374 Accident & Health (a) 4 23 5 Total Domestic (b) 2,920 2,746 2,414 Foreign: Ordinary 1,945 1,609 1,419 Personal Accident 573 531 434 Group Life/Medical 101 82 78 Group Pension 27 25 22 Individual Annuity 105 (1) Eliminations (11) (9) (8) Total Foreign 2,740 2,238 1,944 Total operating income before realized capital losses (b) 5,660 4,984 4,358 Realized capital losses (254) (162) (148) Total operating income (b) $ 5,406 $ 4,822 $ 4,210 Life insurance in force: Domestic $ 517,067 $ 477,576 $ 469,023 Foreign (c) 711,434 494,316 481,910 Total $ 1,228,501 $ 971,892 $ 950,933 (a) Beginning 2001, certain Accident & Health operations are part of DBG. (b) 2001 includes WTC losses of $131 million. (c) 2001 reflects AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. which was acquired in April 2001. 26 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIGs GAAP life premium income in 2001 represented a 12.0 percent increase from the prior year. This compares with an increase of 10.9 percent in 2000 over 1999. Foreign life operations produced 74.3 percent, 71.9 percent and 71.0 percent of the GAAP life premium income in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. (See also Notes 1, 4 and 6 of Notes to Financial Statements.) The traditional life products, particularly individual life products, were major contributors to the growth in foreign premium income. These traditional life products, coupled with the increased distribution of financial and investment products contributed to the growth in foreign investment income. A mixture of traditional, accident and health and financial products are being sold in Japan through ALICO. As previously discussed, the U.S. dollar strengthened in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts business. Accordingly for 2001, when foreign life premium income was translated into U.S. dollars for purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, total life premium income was approximately 6.4 percentage points less than it would have been if translated utilizing exchange rates prevailing in 2000. Life insurance net investment income increased 10.0 percent in 2001 compared to an increase of 12.2 percent in 2000. The growth in net investment income in 2001 and 2000 was attributable to both foreign and domestic new cash flow for investment. The new cash flow was generated from life insurance operations and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) Life insurance realized capital losses were $254 million in 2001, $162 million in 2000 and $148 million in 1999. These realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing investment management of the life insurance portfolios within the overall objectives of the life insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities. Life insurance operating income in 2001 increased 12.1 percent to $5.41 billion compared to an increase of 14.5 percent in 2000. Estimated WTC losses recorded in 2001 amount to $131 million. Adjusted life operating income, which excluded such losses, AGCs home services business operating income, which is being managed as a "closed block," as well as realized capital losses, increased 17.1 percent to $5.34 billion in 2001 when compared to the same period last year. The contribution of life insurance operating income to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and excluding acquisition, restructuring and related charges amounted to 53.2 percent in 2001 compared to 46.6 percent in 2000 and 44.8 percent in 1999. The increase in contribution percentage was influenced by the impact of the WTC losses on general insurance operating income and its reduced contribution to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes. The risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk. The risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is investment risk. Underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses. Both AIGs foreign and domestic life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately one million dollars of coverage and $2.5 million of coverage, respectively, by using yearly renewable term reinsurance. (See also Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements and the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) The investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets, primarily long term fixed rate investments, being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments. (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) To minimize its exposure to investment risk, AIG tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit. If a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur, a demand could be placed upon liquidity. (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) The asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in AIGs foreign operations, as it has been throughout AIGs history, even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities. For example, in Japan and several Southeast Asia territories, the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities. Therefore, there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities. At December 31, 2001, the average duration of the investment portfolio with respect to ALICO Japans operations was 5.4 years. Additionally, there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. The anticipated average period for the receipt and investment of these future premium receipts with respect to ALICO Japans operations is 6.4 years. These durations compare with an estimated average duration with respect to ALICO Japans operations of 10.5 years for the corresponding policy liabilities. To maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities, constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to 27 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) invest the future premium receipts without sacrificing investment quality. To the extent permitted under local regulation, AIG may invest in qualified longer term securities outside Japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield. AIG is able to manage any asset liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network. (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) The asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in AIGs domestic operations, as there is ample supply of qualified long term investments. AIG uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and marketing strategies. As a part of these strategies, AIG may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes. FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS AIGs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including premium financing, banking services and consumer finance services. International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) engages primarily in the acquisition of commercial jet aircraft and the leasing and remarketing of such aircraft to airlines around the world. Also, ILFC provides, for a fee, fleet management services to certain third party operators. (See also Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.) AIG Financial Products Corp. and its subsidiaries (AIGFP) structure financial transactions, including long dated interest rate and currency swaps and structured borrowings through notes, bonds and guaranteed investment agreements. AIGFP does not engage in trading activities with respect to commodity contracts. AIG Trading Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIGTG) engage in various commodity trading, foreign exchange trading, interest rate swaps and market making activities. (See also the discussions under "Capital Resources" herein and Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.) AIGs Consumer Finance operations include American General Finance, Inc. and its subsidiaries (AGF) as well as AIG Consumer Finance Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (CFG). AGF and CFG provide a wide variety of consumer finance products, including mortgages, consumer loans, retail sales finance and credit related insurance to customers both domestically and overseas, particularly emerging markets. (See also Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.) Financial services operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were as follows: (in millions) 2001 2000 1999 Revenues: ILFC (a) $2,613 $2,441 $2,194 AIGFP (b) 1,178 1,056 737 Consumer Finance (c) 2,560 2,325 2,024 Other 134 132 114 Total $6,485 $5,954 $5,069 Operating income: ILFC $ 749 $ 654 $ 590 AIGFP 758 648 482 Consumer Finance 513 398 346 Other, including intercompany adjustments (21) (22) 14 Total $1,999 $1,678 $1,432 (a) Revenues were primarily from aircraft lease rentals. (b) Revenues were primarily fees from proprietary positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. (c) Revenues were primarily finance charges. Financial services operating income increased 19.2 percent in 2001 over 2000. This compares with an increase of 17.1 percent in 2000 over 1999. Financial services operating income represented 19.7 percent of AIGs income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and excluding acquisition, restructuring and related charges in 2001. This compares to 16.2 percent and 15.2 percent in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in contribution percentage was influenced by the impact of the WTC losses on general insurance operating income and its reduced contribution to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes. ILFC generates its revenues primarily from leasing commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for its own account, for airlines and for financial institutions. Revenues in 2001 increased 7.0 percent from 2000 compared to an 11.3 percent increase during 2000 from 1999. The revenue growth in each year resulted primarily from the increase in flight equipment available for operating lease, the increase in the relative cost of the leased fleet and the increase in the relative composition of the fleet with wide bodies which typically receive higher lease payments. Approximately 20 percent of ILFCs operating lease revenues are derived from U.S. and Canadian airlines. During 2001, operating income increased 14.6 percent from 2000 and 10.8 percent during 2000 from 1999. ILFC finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments. The composite borrowing rates at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were 5.07 percent, 6.37 percent and 6.14 percent, respectively. (See also the discussions under "Capital Resources" and "Liquidity" herein and Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.) 28 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries ILFC is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through non performance of aircraft lessees, through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease. ILFC manages its lessee non performance exposure through credit reviews and security deposit requirements. As a result of these measures and its own contingency planning, ILFC did not suffer any material losses from airline shutdowns in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, but there can be no assurance that ILFC will successfully manage the risks relating to the impact of possible future deterioration in the airline industry. At December 31, 2001, ILFCs fleet of 508 aircraft included 471 aircraft for operating lease, four aircraft under finance lease and 33 managed aircraft. Approximately 80 percent of ILFCs fleet is leased to non U.S. and Canadian carriers, and this fleet, the most efficient in the airline industry, continues to be in high demand from such carriers. (See also the discussions under "Capital Resources" and "Liquidity" herein.) AIGFP participates in the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity and credit derivative products business. AIGFP also enters into structured transactions including long dated forward foreign exchange contracts, option transactions, liquidity facilities and investment agreements and invests in a diversified portfolio of securities. AIGFP derives substantially all its revenues from proprietary positions entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than from speculative transactions. Revenues in 2001 increased 11.6 percent from 2000 compared to a 43.3 percent increase during 2000 from 1999. During 2001, operating income increased 16.9 percent from 2000 and increased 34.5 percent during 2000 from 1999. As AIGFP is a transaction oriented operation, current and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for predicting future performance. (See also the discussions under "Capital Resources," "Liquidity" and "Derivatives" herein and Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.) AGF derives a substantial portion of its revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding mortgages and finance receivables from the sub prime market. CFG is engaged in developing a multi product consumer finance business with an emphasis on emerging markets. Revenues in 2001 increased 10.1 percent from 2000 compared to a 14.8 percent increase during 2000 from 1999. The growth in revenues during 2001 was generally due to the growth in the average finance receivables. During 2001, operating income increased 28.8 percent from 2000 and 15.0 percent during 2000 from 1999. The increase in operating income resulted from the growth in finance charges and improved credit quality of the receivables portfolio, partially offset by lower yields on finance receivables in 2001. (See also the discussions under "Capital Resources" and "Liquidity" herein.) AGF is exposed to loss when contractual payments are not received. AGF manages its collection exposure through the mix of types of loans and security thereon. (See also Notes 8 and 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.) RETIREMENT SAVINGS & Asset Management Operations AIGs retirement savings & asset management operations offer a wide variety of investment products, including variable annuities and mutual funds, as well as investment services, including investment asset management. Such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas. AIGs principal retirement savings & asset management operations are conducted through SunAmerica Asset Management Corp. (SAAMCo), The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC), AIG Global Investment Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Global Investment) and AIG Capital Partners, Inc. (Cap Partners). SAAMCo develops and sells variable annuities and other investment products, sells and manages mutual funds and provides financial services. VALIC provides tax qualified annuities to the employees of educational, healthcare and governmental entities. Global Investment manages third party institutional, retail and private equity funds invested assets on a global basis, and provides custodial services. Cap Partners organizes, and manages the invested assets of institutional private equity investment funds and may also invest in such funds. Each of these subsidiary operations receives fees for investment products and services provided. Retirement savings & asset management operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were as follows: (in millions) 2001 2000 1999 Revenues: VALIC $2,333 $2,258 $2,127 SAAMCo 661 754 602 Other 523 463 383 Total $3,517 $3,475 $3,112 Operating income: VALIC $ 684 $ 731 $ 606 SAAMCo 194 331 233 Other 182 99 81 Total $1,060 $1,161 $ 920 Retirement savings & asset management operating income decreased 8.7 percent in 2001 over 2000. This compares with an increase of 26.2 percent in 2000 over 1999. Retirement savings & asset management operating income represented 10.4 percent of AIGs income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and excluding acquisition, restructuring and related charges in 2001. This compares to 11.2 percent and 9.8 percent in 2000 and 1999, respectively. At December 31, 2001, AIGs third party assets under management, including both retail mutual funds and institutional accounts, approximated $39 billion. 29 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) OTHER OPERATIONS Other realized capital losses amounted to $452 million, $190 million and $44 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Other income (deductions) net includes AIGs equity in certain minor majority owned subsidiaries and certain partially owned companies, realized foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in substantially all currencies and unrealized gains and losses in hyperinflationary currencies, as well as the income and expenses of the parent holding company and other miscellaneous income and expenses. In 2001, net deductions amounted to $708 million. In 2000 and 1999, net deductions amounted to $657 million and $600 million, respectively. Acquisition, restructuring and related charges of $2.02 billion were incurred in connection with the acquisition of AGC, including $654 million paid by AGC in connection with the termination of AGCs merger agreement with Prudential plc. Charges of $315 million in 2000 were incurred by AGC in connection with acquisitions by AGC prior to its acquisition by AIG. (See also Note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.) Income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to $8.14 billion in 2001. Income before income taxes and minority interest amounted to $10.02 billion in 2000 and $9.40 billion in 1999. In 2001, AIG recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.34 billion compared to the provisions of $2.97 billion and $2.83 billion in 2000 and 1999, respectively. These provisions represent effective tax rates of 28.7 percent in 2001, 29.6 percent in 2000 and 30.1 percent in 1999. (See Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.) Minority interest represents minority shareholders equity in income of certain majority owned consolidated subsidiaries. Minority interest amounted to $301 million, $413 million and $380 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Income before the cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to $5.50 billion in 2001, $6.64 billion in 2000 and $6.19 billion in 1999. Refer to "Accounting Standards" herein for details of the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Net income amounted to $5.36 billion in 2001, $6.64 billion in 2000 and $6.19 billion in 1999. The decrease in 2001 and increase in 2000 in net income over the three year period resulted from those factors described above. CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2001, AIG had total capital funds of $52.15 billion and total borrowings of $65.73 billion. At that date, $56.82 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) or matched notes and bonds payable. Total borrowings and borrowings not guaranteed or matched at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: (in millions) December 31, 2001 2000 GIAs AIGFP $16,392 $13,595 Commercial Paper: AGC (a) 2,468 1,921 AGF (b) 4,853 5,162 AIG Funding, Inc. 902 968 ILFC (b) 3,494 4,259 A.I.

See also Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. 30 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries During 2001, AIGFP increased the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its notes and bonds payable to $13.92 billion. AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities and derivative transactions. The funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. (See also the discussions under "Operational Review", "Liquidity" and "Derivatives" herein and Notes 1, 8, 9, 12 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.) AIG Funding, Inc. (Funding), through the issuance of commercial paper, fulfills the short term cash requirements of AIG and its non insurance subsidiaries. Funding intends to continue to meet AIGs funding requirements through the issuance of commercial paper guaranteed by AIG. This issuance of Fundings commercial paper is subject to the approval of AIGs Board of Directors. ILFC and A.I. Credit Corp. (AICCO), AIG Credit Card Company (Taiwan) (AIGCCC Taiwan) and AIG Finance (Taiwan) Limited (AIGF Taiwan), both consumer finance subsidiaries in Taiwan, AGC and AGF have issued commercial paper for the funding of their own operations. At December 31, 2001, AIG did not guarantee the commercial paper of any of its subsidiaries other than Funding and AGC. In early 2001, AICCO ceased issuing commercial paper under its program, and the agreement which AIG had provided supporting the commercial paper was terminated; AICCOs funding requirements are now met through Fundings program. (See also the discussion under "Derivatives" herein and Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.) AIG and Funding have entered into syndicated revolving credit facilities (collectively, the Facility) aggregating $1.5 billion. The Facility consists of $1.0 billion in short term revolving credit facilities and a $500 million five year revolving credit facility. The Facility can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for Fundings commercial paper programs. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under the Facility, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2001. AGC and AGF have entered into unsecured bank credit facilities aggregating $5.2 billion to support their commercial paper borrowings. There were no borrowings under these facilities as of December 31, 2001 or currently. AGC had $400 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered and available for issuance as of December 31, 2001. AGF had $3.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered and available for issuance at December 31, 2001. AGC uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds for general corporate purposes. AGF uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds for the funding of its finance receivables. ILFC had entered into committed revolving loans and lines of credit with commercial banks aggregating $3.2 billion to support its commercial paper program. At December 31, 2001, there were no borrowings under these facilities. As of February 28, 2002, these committed revolving loans and lines of credit totalled $2.7 billion. At December 31, 2001, ILFC had increased the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its medium term and term notes to $11.88 billion, a net increase of $3.18 billion, and recorded a net decline in its capital lease obligations of $98 million and a net decrease in its commercial paper of $765 million. At December 31, 2001, ILFC had $900 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time. In addition, ILFC had established a Euro Medium Term Note Program for $2.0 billion, under which $771 million in notes were sold through December 31, 2001. ILFC had an Export Credit Facility up to a maximum of $4.3 billion, for approximately 75 aircraft to be delivered through 2001. ILFC had the right, but was not required, to use the facility to fund 85 percent of each aircrafts purchase price. This facility was guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on the first 75 aircraft depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At December 31, 2001, ILFC had $2.37 billion outstanding under this facility. Borrowings with respect to this facility are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the accompanying table of borrowings. The proceeds of ILFCs debt financing are primarily used to purchase flight equipment, including progress payments during the construction phase. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. (See also the discussions under "Operational Review" and "Liquidity" herein.) During 2001, AIG issued $137 million principal amount of Medium Term Notes, and $177 million of previously issued notes matured. At December 31, 2001, AIG had $644 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time. On November 9, 2001, AIG received proceeds of approximately $1 billion from the issuance of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031 with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of approximately $1.52 billion. Commencing January 1, 2002, the debentures are convertible into shares of AIG common stock at a conversion rate of 6.0627 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures if AIG common stock trades at certain levels for certain time periods. The debentures are callable by AIG on or after November 9, 2006. Also, holders can require AIG to repurchase these debentures once every five years. The proceeds from the offering have been used for general corporate purposes. AIGs capital funds increased $4.71 billion during 2001. Unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes increased $1.01 billion. During 2001, the cumulative translation adjustment loss, net of taxes, increased $344 million. The change for 2001 with respect to the unrealized appreciation of invest 31 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries ments, net of taxes was primarily due to the decline in domestic interest rates. The transfer of bonds in the held to maturity, at amortized cost category to the bonds available for sale, at market value category in accordance with the transition provisions of FASB 133 resulted in a gain of $339 million recorded in the statement of comprehensive income as a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment. At December 31, 2001, capital funds included a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment gain of $150 million. During 2001, there was a loss of $443 million, net of taxes relating to derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments. (See also the discussion under "Operational Review" and "Liquidity" herein, Notes 1(x) and 8(d) of Notes to Financial Statements and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.) During 2001, retained earnings increased $4.62 billion, resulting from net income less dividends. During 2001, AIG repurchased in the open market 13,619,900 shares of its common stock. Included in these repurchases were approximately 10 million shares which were exempt from pooling of interests accounting restrictions under orders issued by the SEC following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. During 2002 through February 28, AIG repurchased in the open market an additional 4,250,000 shares of its common stock. AIG intends to continue to buy its common shares in the open market for general corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans. Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by statutory authorities. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities. At December 31, 2001, there were no significant statutory or regulatory issues which would impair AIGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, but there can be no assurance that such issues will not arise in the future. To AIGs knowledge, no AIG company is on any regulatory or similar "watch list". (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein and Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.) AIGs insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance companys statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. At December 31, 2001, the adjusted capital of each of AIGs domestic general companies and of each of AIGs domestic life companies exceeded each of their RBC standards by considerable margins. Federal, state or local legislation may affect AIGs ability to operate and expand its various financial services businesses and changes in the current laws, regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses. A substantial portion of AIGs general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIGs insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIGs international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of AIGs operations without compensation. Adverse effects resulting from any one country may impact AIGs results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIGs net financial exposure at that time in that country. The maturity schedule of AIGs contractual obligations at December 31, 2001 was as follows: (in millions) December 31, 2001 PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD 2003 2005 REMAINING THROUGH THROUGH YEARS AFTER TOTAL 2002 2004 2006 2006 Borrowings* $53,839 $19,336 $14,986 $ 5,183 $14,334 Operating Leases 2,242 462 636 352 792 Unconditional Obligations to Purchase Aircraft 32,092 4,893 7,683 9,566 9,950 Other Long Term Obligations: ILFC 1,161 305 392 464 Other 161 1 40 32 88 Total $89,495 $24,997 $23,737 $15,597 $25,164 *Excludes commercial paper and includes ILFCs capital lease obligations. 32 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The maturity schedule of AIGs Other Commercial Commitments at December 31, 2001 was as follows: (in millions) AMOUNT OF COMMITMENT EXPIRATION TOTAL LESS AMOUNTS THAN 1 1 3 4 5 AFTER 5 COMMITTED YEAR YEARS YEARS YEARS Letters of Credit: AIGFP $ 764 $ 1 $ 16 $ 100 $ 647 Other 367 281 31 1 54 Guarantees: SunAmerica 3,931 45 1,447 2,439 Other 960 382 397 61 120 Other Commercial Commitments: AIGFP (a) 4,445 9 20 37 4,379 ILFC (b) 3,524 1,184 1,434 906 SunAmerica 1,300 260 650 390 Other 1,534 926 463 137 8 Total $16,825 $1,904 $4,208 $2,160 $8,553 (a) Primarily liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions. (b) Primarily in connection with aircraft acquisitions. AIG uses special purposes vehicles (SPVs) primarily in connection with certain guaranteed investment contract programs ("GIC Programs") written by its life insurance subsidiaries, certain products provided by AIGFP, and certain invested asset and asset management activities. In the GIC Programs, AIGs life insurance subsidiaries (principally SunAmerica Life Insurance Company) provide guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) to SPVs which are not controlled by AIG. The SPVs issue notes or bonds which are sold to third party institutional investors. Neither AIG nor the insurance company issuing the GICs has any obligation to the investors in the notes or bonds. The proceeds from the SPVs issuance of securities are used to invest in the GICs. The insurance company subsidiaries use these proceeds to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, primarily investment grade bonds (see also the discussion under "Liquidity: Insurance Invested Assets"). Both the assets and the liabilities arising from these GIC Programs are presented in AIGs consolidated balance sheet. Thus, at December 31, 2001, approximately $22 billion of Policyholders contract deposits represented liabilities from issuances of GICs included in these GIC Programs, offset by the proceeds from the issuances included as insurance invested assets. AIGFP uses SPVs as an integral part of its ongoing operations with respect to specific structured transactions with independent third parties. AIGFP controls and manages the assets and liabilities with respect to these SPVs, subject to certain transaction specific limitations. These SPVs are fully consolidated by AIG (see the discussions of AIGFP under "Operations Review: Financial Services Operations"). AIGs insurance operations also invest in assets of SPVs. These SPVs are established by unrelated third parties. Investments include collateralized mortgage backed securities and similar securities backed by pools of mortgages, consumer receivables or other assets. The investment in an SPV allows AIGs insurance entities to purchase assets permitted by insurance regulations while maximizing the return on these assets. AIG provides investment management services to certain SPVs. AIG receives management fees for these services and may take a minority ownership interest in these SPVs. AIG services may be terminated with or without cause. To facilitate and expand certain retirement savings and asset management activities, AIG establishes SPVs. AIG receives fees for management of the assets held in the SPV which support the issuance of securities such as collateralized bond obligations sold by the SPV to independent third party investors. These SPVs serve a variety of business purposes, including financing, liquidity, or to facilitate independent third party management participation. AIG has established stringent guidelines with respect to the formation of and investment in SPVs. LIQUIDITY AIGs liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its general and life insurance operations. At December 31, 2001, AIGs consolidated invested assets included $8.09 billion of cash and short term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2001 amounted to $7.71 billion. Sources of funds considered in meeting the objectives of AIGs financial services operations include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long and short term debt, maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, issuance of equity, and cash provided from such operations. AIGs strong 33 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) capital position is integral to managing this liquidity, as it enables AIG to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide. (See also the discussions under "Capital Resources" herein.) Management believes that AIGs liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. In the aggregate, AIGs insurance operations generated approximately $27.4 billion in pre tax cash flow during 2001. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders contract deposits, paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, acquisition and operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. AIGs insurance investment operations generated approximately $14.1 billion in investment income cash flow during 2001. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses. (See also the discussions under "Operational Review: General Insurance Operations" and "Life Insurance Operations" herein.) With respect to general insurance operations, if paid losses accelerated beyond AIGs ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, AIG would need to liquidate a portion of its general insurance investment portfolio and or arrange for financing. Such events that may cause such a liquidity strain could be the result of several catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time. Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable significantly decreased in value. (See also the discussions under "Operational Review: General Insurance Operations" herein.) With respect to life insurance operations, if a substantial portion of the life insurance operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and or defaulted, AIG would need to liquidate other portions of its life insurance investment portfolio and or arrange financing. Such events that may cause such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic collapse of a nation or region in which AIG life insurance operations exist, nationalization, terrorist acts or other such economic or political upheaval. (See also the discussions under "Operational Review: Life Insurance Operations" herein.) In addition to the combined insurance pre tax operating cash flow, AIGs insurance operations held $7.2 billion in cash and short term investments at December 31, 2001. The aforementioned operating cash flow and the cash and short term balances held provided AIGs insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent marketable equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately $116 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately $140 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 2001. The following table is a summary of AIGs invested assets by significant segment, including investment income due and accrued of $3.68 billion and $3.52 billion and real estate of $2.65 billion and $2.08 billion, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively: (dollars in millions) INVESTED PERCENT ASSETS OF TOTAL 2001 General insurance $ 43,159 11.9% Life insurance 215,658 59.3 Financial services, and retirement savings & asset management 103,944 28.6 Other 967 0.2 Total $363,728 100.0% 2000 General insurance $ 42,892 14.0% Life insurance 171,019 56.0 Financial services, and retirement savings & asset management 90,675 29.7 Other 831 0.3 Total $305,417 100.0% 34 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries INSURANCE INVESTED ASSETS The following tables summarize the composition of AIGs insurance invested assets by insurance segment, including investment income due and accrued and real estate, at December 31, 2001 and 2000: (dollars in millions) PERCENT DISTRIBUTION GENERAL LIFE PERCENT DECEMBER 31, 2001 INSURANCE INSURANCE TOTAL OF TOTAL DOMESTIC FOREIGN Fixed maturities: Available for sale, at market value (a) $29,602 $169,750 $199,352 77.0% 68.8% 31.2% Equity securities, at market value (b) 4,568 3,139 7,707 3.0 53.9 46.1 Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans 58 17,101 17,159 6.6 71.4 28.6 Short term investments, including time deposits, and cash 1,652 5,520 7,172 2.8 49.6 50.4 Real estate 410 2,106 2,516 1.0 21.5 78.5 Investment income due and accrued 573 3,002 3,575 1.4 63.9 36.1 Other invested assets 6,296 15,040 21,336 8.2 81.2 18.8 Total $43,159 $215,658 $258,817 100.0% 68.5% 31.5% (a) Includes $842 million of bond trading securities, at market value.

(b) Includes $1.19 billion of non redeemable preferred stocks, at market value. Generally, insurance regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance company may invest. With respect to fixed maturities, AIGs general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer, industry and or country concentrations. With respect to general insurance, AIGs strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase. With respect to life insurance, AIGs strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities (See also the discussion under "Operational Review: Life Insurance Operations" herein.) The fair value of the fixed maturity available for sale portfolio is subject to decline as interest rates rise and subject to increase as interest rates decline. Such changes in fair value are presented as a component of comprehensive income in unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes. The fixed maturities held to maturity portfolio were transferred to bonds available for sale, at market value as at January 1, 2001 as permitted and in accordance with the transition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FASB 133). (See also the discussion under "Accounting Standards" herein.) At December 31, 2001, approximately 69 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities. Approximately 30 percent of such domestic securities were rated AAA. Approximately 9 percent were below investment grade or not rated. A significant portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio is rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors (S&P) or similar foreign services. Similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG annually reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments, including mortgages. At December 31, 2001, approximately 10 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIGs internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to 35 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) securities so rated. Approximately 16 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. A large portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance. At December 31, 2001, approximately 16 percent of the fixed maturities portfolio was CMOs, including commercial mortgage backed securities. Substantially all of the CMOs were investment grade and approximately 26 percent of the CMOs were backed by various U.S. government agencies. CMOs are exposed to interest rate risk as the duration and ultimate realized yield would be affected by the accelerated prepayments of the underlying mortgages. Any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date. AIG invests in equities for various reasons, including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk. Equity securities are subject to declines in fair value. Such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes as a component of comprehensive income. Where declines in value of fixed income and equity securities below amortized cost or cost are considered to be other than temporary, a charge is reflected in income for the difference between amortized cost or cost and estimated net realizable value. Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans comprised 6.6 percent of AIGs insurance invested assets at December 31, 2001. AIGs insurance operations holdings of real estate mortgages amounted to $10.71 billion of which 85.6 percent was domestic. At December 31, 2001, only a nominal amount were in default. It is AIGs practice to maintain a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 percent at loan origination. At December 31, 2001, AIGs insurance holdings of collateral loans amounted to $667 million, all of which were foreign. It is AIGs strategy to enter into mortgage and collateral loans as an adjunct primarily to life insurance fixed maturity investments. AIGs policy loans increased from $5.47 billion at December 31, 2000 to $5.79 billion at December 31, 2001. Short term investments represent amounts invested in various internal and external money market funds, time deposits and cash held. AIGs real estate investment properties are primarily occupied by AIGs various operations. The current market value of these properties considerably exceeds their carrying value. Other invested assets were primarily comprised of both foreign and domestic private placements, limited partnerships, outside managed funds, and collateral held with respect to AIGs securities lending program. When permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIG and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users. (See also the discussion under "Derivatives" herein.) In certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. These barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds. AIGs insurance operations are exposed to market risk. Market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies. Such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques. One such technique is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management. AIG has performed a VaR analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of AIGs insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment. In this analysis, financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued. Financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders funds. Due to the nature of each insurance segment, AIG manages the general and life insurance operations separately. As a result, AIG manages separately the invested assets of each. Accordingly, the VaR analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations. 36 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of each of AIGs insurance segments as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000. AIG uses the historical simulation methodology which entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. In this case, the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios. For each scenario, each transaction was re priced. Portfolio, business unit and finally AIG wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities. The final VaR number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95% confidence (i.e., only 5% of historical scenarios show losses greater than the VaR figure). A one month holding period was assumed in computing the VaR figure. The following table presents the VaR on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of AIGs insurance segments as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000. VaR with respect to combined operations cannot be derived by aggregating the individual risk or segment amounts presented herein.

(See also the discussions under "Operational Review: Financial Services Operations", "Operational Review: Retirement Savings & Asset Management Operations", "Capital Resources" and "Derivatives" herein.) (dollars in millions) 2001 2000 INVESTED PERCENT Invested Percent ASSETS OF TOTAL Assets of Total Flight equipment primarily under operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation $ 22,710 21.9% $19,325 21.3% Finance receivables, net of allowance 13,955 13.4 13,327 14.7 Unrealized gain on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions 11,493 11.1 10,235 11.3 Securities available for sale, at market value 17,801 17.1 14,669 16.2 Trading securities, at market value 5,733 5.5 7,347 8.1 Securities purchased under agreements to resell, at contract value 21,638 20.8 14,979 16.5 Trading assets 6,234 6.0 7,045 7.8 Spot commodities, at market value 352 0.3 363 0.4 Other, including short term investments 4,028 3.9 3,385 3.7 Total $103,944 100.0% $90,675 100.0% As previously discussed, the cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ILFCs debt financings. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. During 2001, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing $4.41 billion. (See also the discussion under "Operational Review: Financial Services Operations" and Capital Resources" herein.) At December 31, 2001, ILFC had committed to purchase 551 aircraft deliverable from 2002 through 2010 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $32.1 billion and had options to purchase 49 aircraft deliverable from 2002 through 2008 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $3.0 billion. As of March 19, 2002, ILFC has entered into leases for all of the aircraft to be delivered in 2002 and 92 of 467 aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2002. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing, but there can be no assurance that such success will continue in future environments. ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, AIG statistically measured the aforementioned loss of fair value through the application of a VaR model. In this analysis, the net fair value of ILFC was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt. The estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of ILFC using the historical simulation methodology, as previously described. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the VaR with respect to the aforementioned net fair value of ILFC was approximately $10 million and $11 million, respectively. AIGs Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products both domestically and overseas. Such products include mortgages, consumer loans, and retail sales finance. These products are funded through various borrowings including commercial paper and medium term notes. AIGs Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. Over half of the loan balance is related to real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties. With respect to credit losses, the allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio. AIGFPs derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The 38 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that the impact of any such limited liquidity would not be significant to AIGs financial condition or its overall liquidity. (See also the discussion under "Operational Review: Financial Services Operations" and "Derivatives" herein.) AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, including securities available for sale, at market, and derivative transactions. The funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing GIAs or other AIGFP financings. (See also the discussion under "Capital Resources" herein.) Securities available for sale is mainly a portfolio of debt securities, where the individual securities have varying degrees of credit risk. At December 31, 2001, the average credit rating of this portfolio was AA or the equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal review. AIGFP has also entered into credit derivative transactions to hedge its credit risk associated with $182 million of these securities. There were no securities deemed below investment grade at December 31, 2001. There have been no significant downgrades through March 1, 2002. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized transactions. AIGFP takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIGFP further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and, when AIGFP deems necessary, it requires additional collateral to be deposited. Trading securities, at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGFP is exposed to credit risk. If its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement, AIGFP could have a liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFPs debt and, as a result, is responsible for all of AIGFPs obligations. AIGTG conducts, as principal, market making and trading activities in foreign exchange, and commodities, primarily precious and base metals. AIGTG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIGTG uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. AIGTG supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities, unrealized losses on swaps, short term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased. (See also the discussions under "Capital Resources" and "Derivatives" herein.) The gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of AIGFP and AIGTG included in the financial services assets and liabilities at December 31, 2001 were as follows: (in millions) GROSS GROSS UNREALIZED UNREALIZED GAINS LOSSES Securities available for sale, at market value (a) $ 1,025 $1,017 Unrealized gain/loss on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions (b) (c) 11,493 8,813 Trading assets 8,346 7,017 Spot commodities, at market value 27 Trading liabilities 1,709 Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value 423 (a) See also Note 8(e) of Notes to Financial Statements. (b) These amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts. (c) At December 31, 2001, AIGTGs replacement values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps were $549 million. AIGFPs interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale, at market, are managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation. At December 31, 2001, the unrealized gains and losses remaining after the benefit of the offsets were $75 million and $67 million, respectively. Trading securities, at market value, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These securities are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for AIGFP and AIGTG. AIGs senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market, operational and credit issues of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior managements of AIGFP and AIGTG report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with AIGs senior management. AIG actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIG must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. Market risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. AIG generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions. AIGs philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set 39 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried. Credit risk exposure is separately managed. (See the discussion on the management of credit risk below.) AIGs Market Risk Management Department provides detailed independent review of AIGs market exposures, particularly those market exposures of AIGFP and AIGTG. This department determines whether AIGs market risks, as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries, are within the parameters established by AIGs senior management. Well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used. Additionally, this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and the shape and slope of the yield curve. AIGFP hedges its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions such as interest rate swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates. AIGFP hedges its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of currency swaps, options, forwards and futures. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices which affect the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular stock, a basket of stocks or a stock index. AIGFP reduces the risk of loss inherent in its inventory in equity securities by entering into hedging transactions, including equity swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its transactions through an individual offsetting transaction. Rather, AIGFP takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure. AIGFP values its portfolio, including interest rate swaps, currency swaps, equity swaps, swaptions, options and forwards, at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available. Unrealized gains and losses, with respect to this portfolio are reflected in income currently. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of AIGFPs transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by AIGFPs and AIGs management. AIGFP evaluates the portfolios discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. The aforementioned estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models. These models utilize, among other things, market liquidity and current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. AIGFP attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription services such as from Bloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model. When such prices are not available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. These valuation models are integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio, as described above, in order to provide timely information for the market risk management of the portfolio. Based upon this evaluation, AIGFP determines what, if any, offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio. AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate. The recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity. Additionally, depending upon the changes in interest rates and other market movements during the day, AIGFPs system will produce reports for managements consideration for intraday offsetting positions. Overnight, the system generates reports which recommend the types of offsets management should consider for the following day. Additionally, AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the clock. Therefore, offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any AIGFP office in the world. As part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk, AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements. These techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio. In addition to the daily monitoring, AIGFPs senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges. This review includes an examination of the portfolios risk measures, such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables. AIGFPs management may change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets. This management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio. All of AIGTGs market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes. The fair values of AIGTGs financial instruments are exposed to market risk as a result of adverse market changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and adverse changes in the liquidity of the markets in which AIGTG trades. AIGTGs approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk AIGTG expects to reduce. 40 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIGTGs senior management has established positions and stop loss limits for each line of business. AIGTGs traders are required to maintain positions within these limits. These positions are monitored during the day either manually and or through on line computer systems. In addition, these positions are reviewed by AIGTGs management. Reports which present each trading books position and the prior days profit and loss are reviewed by traders, head traders and AIGTGs senior management. Based upon these and other reports, AIGTGs senior management may determine to adjust AIGTGs risk profile. AIGTG attempts to secure reliable current market prices, such as published prices or third party quotes, to value its derivatives. Where such prices are not available, AIGTG uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. The methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates, commodity prices, volatility rates, market liquidity and other relevant factors. Unrealized gains and losses, with respect to AIGTGs positions are reflected in income currently. A significant portion of AIGTGs business is transacted in liquid markets. Certain of AIGTGs derivative product exposures are evaluated using simulation techniques which consider such factors as changes in currency and commodity prices, interest rates, volatility levels, market liquidity and the effect of time. AIGFP and AIGTG are both exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. AIG statistically measured the losses of fair value through the application of a VaR model. AIG separately calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG, as AIG manages these operations separately. AIGFPs and AIGTGs asset and liability portfolios for which the VaR analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments, derivative instruments and commodities. Since the market risk with respect to securities available for sale, at market is substantially hedged, segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000. AIG uses the historical simulation methodology which entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. In this case, the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios. For each scenario, each transaction was re priced. Portfolio, business unit and finally AIG wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities. The final VaR number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95% confidence (i.e., only 5% of historical scenarios show losses greater than the VaR figure). The following table presents the VaR on a combined basis and of each component of AIGFPs and AIGTGs market risk as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000.

The returns of the derivatives are linked to or "derived" from some underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or index. Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities, certain commodities, or financial or commodity indices. The more significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures and options. Derivatives are generally either negotiated over the counter contracts or standardized contracts executed on an exchange. Standardized exchange traded derivatives include futures and options which can be readily bought or sold over recognized security or commodity exchanges and settled daily through such clearing houses. Negotiated over the counter derivatives include forwards, swaps and options. Over the counter derivatives are generally not traded like exchange traded securities and the terms of over the counter derivatives are non standard and unique to each contract. However, in the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty. The overwhelming majority of AIGs derivatives activities are conducted through AIGFP and AIGTG, thus permitting AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates, securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. AIGs customers such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. To help manage this risk, the credit departments of AIGFP and AIGTG operate within the guidelines set by the AIG Credit Risk Committee. This committee establishes the credit policy, sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account other factors, including the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIGs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary. AIGFP and AIGTG determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. If it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement, then one or more enhancement techniques will be used. Examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit, guarantees, collateral credit triggers and credit derivatives and margin agreements. A significant majority of AIGFPs transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set off in the event of default. Also, under such agreements, in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity, AIGFP may be permitted to set off its receivables from that counterparty against AIGFPs payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. Excluding regulated exchange transactions, AIGTG, whenever possible, enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above. Discussions with respect to AIGFPs and AIGTGs counterpart credit quality, fair value source and notional amounts follow. COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY: The following tables provide the counterparty credit quality amounts of AIGFPs and AIGTGs derivatives transactions at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of the aforementioned strategies, netting under ISDA Master Agreements and applying collateral held. Subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate, currency and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments approximated $10.84 billion at December 31, 2001 and $9.51 billion at December 31, 2000. The net replacement value for futures and forward contracts approximated $64 million at December 31, 2001 and $204 million at December 31, 2000. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss and is used for financial reporting purposes. 42 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIGFP determines counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or, where such ratings are not available, by internal analysis. At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the concentration of credit exposure with respect to counterparties judged A or higher by AIGFP was 93 percent and 87 percent, respectively. The counterparty credit quality determined by AIGFP by derivative product with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFPs derivatives portfolio was as follows: (in millions) NET REPLACEMENT VALUE SWAPS AND FUTURES AND TOTAL TOTAL SWAPTIONS FORWARD CONTRACTS 2001 2000 Counterparty credit quality: AAA $ 4,388 $ $ 4,388 $3,778 AA 3,153 61 3,214 2,825 A 2,497 1 2,498 1,801 BBB 782 2 784 1,059 Below investment grade 23 23 252 Total $10,843 $ 64 $10,907 $9,715 At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFPs derivatives portfolio was as follows: (in millions) NET REPLACEMENT VALUE SWAPS AND FUTURES AND TOTAL TOTAL SWAPTIONS FORWARD CONTRACTS 2001 2000 Non U.S. banks $ 2,408 $56 $ 2,464 $2,517 Insured municipalities 638 638 595 U.S. industrials 2,113 2,113 1,945 Governmental 563 563 463 Non U.S. financial service companies 427 1 428 309 Non U.S. industrials 1,288 1 1,289 1,372 Special purpose 1,851 1,851 1,204 U.S. banks 66 6 72 220 U.S. financial service companies 1,211 1,211 894 Supranationals 278 278 196 Total $10,843 $64 $10,907 $9,715 With respect to AIGTGs derivatives contracts at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the net replacement values represent the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral held. The net replacement values most closely represent the net credit risk to AIGTG or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss. Subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all futures, forwards, swaptions and purchased options contracts and interest rate and currency swaps was $3.05 billion and $4.08 billion at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively. 43 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) AIGTGs net replacement value at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was as follows: (in millions) REMAINING LIFE ONE TWO THROUGH SIX THROUGH AFTER TEN TOTAL TOTAL YEAR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS YEARS 2001 2000 Credit exposure: Futures, forwards, swaptions and purchased options contracts and interest rate and currency swaps: Gross replacement value $ 6,541 $ 2,201 $ 1,299 $ 33 $10,074 $10,319 Master netting arrangements (4,097) (1,572) (1,004) (18) (6,691) (6,136) Collateral (32) (84) (199) (15) (330) (107) Net replacement value* $ 2,412 $ 545 $ 96 $ $ 3,053 $ 4,076 *The net replacement values with respect to exchange traded futures and options, forward contracts and purchased over the counter options are presented as a component of trading assets in the accompanying balance sheet.

When such prices are not available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. 44 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries At December 31, 2001, the fair value source of the net replacement value of AIGTGs derivatives portfolio was as follows: (in millions) MATURITY OF FAIR VALUE OF CONTRACTS TWO THROUGH SIX FIVE THROUGH AFTER SOURCE OF FAIR VALUE ONE YEAR YEARS TEN YEARS TEN YEARS TOTAL Prices actively quoted $ 2,412 $ $ $ $2,412 Prices provided by other external sources 530 530 Prices based on models and other valuation methods 15 96 111 Total $ 2,412 $ 545 $ 96 $ $3,053 NOTIONAL AMOUNTS: The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGFPs and AIGTGs involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGFPs and AIGTGs swaps business. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to AIGFPs and AIGTGs foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements.

These transactions are generally executed with AIGFP and AIGTG as counterparty, who in turn hedge these transactions in the market place. Thus, AIGFP and AIGTG assume the credit risk exposure. AIG also uses derivatives to help match assets and liabilities in several of its businesses, including its insurance operations. For example, AIG can use currency and interest rate swaps to convert foreign currency investment contract liabilities into US dollar based exposures. Thus, these liabilities are more properly matched with US dollar assets. In life insurance, AIG uses swaps to reduce the mismatch between long dated life insurance liabilities and shorter dated local currency assets. Swaps also enable AIG to balance its asset and liability durations in consumer finance operations. AIGs Derivatives Review Committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction. The committee examines, among other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. This committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG for their own accounts. Generally, AIG conducts its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment. Thus, exchange gains or losses occur when AIGs foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar from one reporting period to the next. Legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability, through legal or judicial processes, of the obligations of AIGs clients and counterparties, including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations. (See also the discussion on master netting agreements above.) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FASB 133). In June 2000, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" (collectively, FASB 133). FASB 133 requires AIG to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The financial statement recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative and the extent to which it is effective as part of a hedge transaction. The changes in fair value of the derivative transactions of AIGFP and AIGTG are currently presented, in all material respects, as a component of AIGs operating income. The discussion below relates to the derivative activities of AIG other than those of AIGFP and AIGTG. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, AIG designates the derivative as: (1) a hedge of the subsequent changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ("fair value" hedge); (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction, or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ("cash flow" hedge); or (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Fair value and cash flow hedges may involve foreign currencies ("foreign currency hedges"). The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a fair value hedge is recorded in current period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a cash flow hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustments account within other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used for other than the above hedging activities are reported in current period earnings. AIG documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedge items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, or specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. AIG also assesses, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. In accordance with the transition provisions of FASB 133, AIG recorded in its consolidated income statement for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment loss of $6 million. This loss represents the net fair value of all previously unrecorded derivative instruments as of January 1, 2001, net of tax and after the application of hedge accounting. AIG also recorded in its consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment gain of $150 million. This gain represents the increase in other comprehensive income, net of taxes, arising from recognizing the fair value of all derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments, and to a lesser extent, hedging instruments used to hedge net investments in foreign operations. 46 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIG (excluding its two trading operations, AIGFP and AIGTG) uses derivative instruments (principally swap and forward contracts) to minimize AIGs asset liability exposure and foreign currency and interest rate exposures. These risks arise primarily from available for sale fixed income securities, debt, and policyholder account balance liabilities associated with guaranteed investment contracts. Other hedging activities, such as those involving forecasted transactions or equity securities, are not significant. During 2001, there were no hedges that were discontinued or otherwise no longer qualify as hedges under FASB 133. With respect to both fair value hedges and cash flow hedges, hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for 2001. During 2001, there were minor reclassifications to earnings from other comprehensive income under cash flow hedge accounting. These reclassifications were connected to programs of synthetically converting certain investment securities, debt issuances or policyholder account balance liabilities associated with guaranteed investment contracts, from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate. As at December 31, 2001, the maximum amount of net derivative losses to be reclassified into net income within the next twelve months is insignificant. The maximum length of time over which future cash flows are hedged is approximately 16 years. In addition to hedging activities, AIG also uses derivative instruments with respect to investment operations, which include, among other things, writing option contracts, and purchasing investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity linked notes and convertible bonds. All changes in the market value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. AIG bifurcates an embedded derivative where: (1) the economic characteristics of the embedded instruments are not clearly and closely related to those of the remaining components of the financial instrument; and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument meets the definition of a derivative under FASB 133. In accordance with the transition provisions of FASB 133, AIG transferred bonds in the held to maturity, at amortized cost category into the bonds available for sale, at market value category at January 1, 2001. The amortized cost of the bonds transferred was $11.53 billion. The unrealized appreciation, net of deferred tax expense was approximately $339 million at the date of transfer and was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change within other comprehensive income. Under the provisions of FASB 133, such a transfer does not affect AIGs intent nor its ability to hold current or future bonds to their maturity. In January 1, 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 99 20, "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets." EITF 99 20 provides guidance on the calculation of interest income and the recognition of impairments related to beneficial interests held in an investment portfolio. Beneficial interests are investments that represent rights to receive specified cash flows from a pool of underlying assets (i.e., collateralized debt obligations). In accordance with the transition provisions of EITF 99 20, AIG recorded in its consolidated income statement for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment loss of $130 million ($200 million before tax). In June 2001, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141 "Business Combinations" (FASB 141). FASB 141 requires AIG to apply the purchase method of accounting for all acquisitions initiated after June 30, 2001. In June 2001, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (FASB 142). FASB 142 is effective for AIG for the year commencing January 1, 2002. FASB 142 requires AIG to discontinue the amortization of goodwill in its consolidated income statement. However, FASB 142 requires goodwill to be subject to an assessment of impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred. AIG believes that the impact on its results of operations and financial condition will not be significant. 47 ITEM 7A.
