ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AIGs operations are conducted principally through four business segments: general insurance, life insurance, financial services and retirement savings & asset management. Within each of these business segments are various operating groups generally formed based upon products or services which may be offered in different geographic locations. [FLOWCHART] Throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful, as well as most transparent. Operating income is shown exclusive of realized capital gains (losses) because the determination to realize capital gains or losses is generally independent of the insurance underwriting process. Operating income and the related performance rates are also shown exclusive of one or more of the 2002 reserve charge discussed under "Loss Reserve Charge" herein, 2001 acquisition, restructuring and related charges, and 2001 World Trade Center and related losses (WTC losses) because AIG believes that these items are sufficiently unusual that they do not reflect the underlying basic performance of the business. Net income is presented exclusive of these items as well as the cumulative effect of accounting changes for the same reason. Premium income, gross premiums written, statutory underwriting profit (loss) and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with AIGs insurance competitors. A reconciliation of these measurements to the most equivalent measurements presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is presented on page 20. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AIGs revenues in 2002 increased 9.3 percent to $67.5 billion when compared to $61.8 billion in 2001. Growth in revenues was primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned from the general insurance operations. This growth was negatively impacted by realized capital losses incurred. The following tables reconcile results reported on a GAAP basis to the presentation AIG management believes is most meaningful. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, MINORITY INTEREST AND CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES: (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 As reported $ 8,142 $ 8,139 $10,023 Loss reserve charge 2,800 WTC losses 900 Realized capital losses 2,441 836 314 Acquisition, restructuring and related charges 2,017 315 As adjusted Management reporting basis $13,383 $11,892 $10,652 NET INCOME: (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 As reported $ 5,519 $ 5,363 $ 6,639 Loss reserve charge 1,794 WTC losses 533 Realized capital losses 1,596 542 214 Acquisition, restructuring and related charges 1,385 207 Cumulative effect of accounting changes 136 As adjusted Management reporting basis $ 8,909 $ 7,959 $ 7,060 AIGs income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes increased modestly in 2002 when compared to 2001. Factors influencing the growth were not only the increase in realized capital losses but also the impact of the $2.8 billion loss reserve charge in 2002. (See discussion under "Loss Reserve Charge" herein.) If the realized capital losses and such loss reserve charge were excluded from 2002 income and $836 million in realized capital losses, $900 million in WTC losses and $2.02 billion of acquisition, restructuring and related charges were excluded in 2001, AIGs growth in income before taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes would be 12.5 percent. AIG believes that the growth rates discussed above are more representative of the overall growth of its operations than the rates determined including the impact of events AIG views as unusual and unlikely to recur. 22 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIGs net income in 2002 increased 2.9 percent to $5.52 billion when compared to $5.36 billion in 2001. Excluding net of tax, realized capital gains (losses), the $1.8 billion loss reserve charge in 2002, the $1.38 billion of acquisition, restructuring and related charges, $533 million in WTC losses, and $136 million cumulative effect of accounting changes incurred in 2001, AIGs net income in 2002 increased 11.9 percent. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE OPERATIONS OF EACH PRINCIPAL SEGMENT FOR 2002, 2001 AND 2000. (SEE ALSO NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.) : (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Revenues: General insurance(a) $ 26,171 $ 22,128 $ 20,146 Life insurance(b) 31,541 29,893 26,963 Financial services(c) 6,815 6,485 5,954 Retirement savings & asset management(d) 3,485 3,712 3,465 Other (530) (452) (190) Total $ 67,482 $ 61,766 $ 56,338 Operating income: General insurance $ 667 $ 2,851 $ 3,524 Life insurance 4,929 4,675 4,058 Financial services 2,189 1,991 1,666 Retirement savings & asset management 1,016 1,088 1,108 Other (659) (2,466) (333) Total $ 8,142 $ 8,139 $ 10,023 (a) Represents the sum of net premiums earned, net investment income and realized capital gains (losses).

(d) Represents retirement savings & asset management commissions and other fees. GENERAL INSURANCE General insurance operating income decreased 76.6 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. The primary reasons for this decline were the loss reserve charge of $2.8 billion and an increase in realized capital losses of over $700 million. Excluding realized capital gains (losses), the loss reserve charge in 2002 and WTC losses of $769 million, including $200 million from Transatlantic, in 2001, general insurance operating income increased 15.4 percent. LIFE INSURANCE Life insurance operating income increased 5.4 percent in 2002 compared to 2001, impacted by an increase in realized capital losses of nearly $800 million. Excluding realized capital gains (losses) and WTC losses of $131 million in 2001, life insurance operating income increased 18.2 percent, reflecting operating income growth in each of AIGs principal life insurance businesses. FINANCIAL SERVICES Financial services operating income increased 9.9 percent in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting the continued growth of each of its principal operations. RETIREMENT SAVINGS & ASSET MANAGEMENT Retirement savings & asset management operating income decreased 6.6 percent in 2002 when compared to 2001. Results in the variable annuity business continue to be impacted by weak equity markets in the United States and around the world. REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES During 2002, AIG incurred net realized capital losses of $2.44 billion, including $356 million from WorldCom Inc. securities. CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2002, AIG had total capital funds of $59.10 billion and total borrowings of $71.89 billion. At that date, $64.98 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) or matched notes and bonds payable. During 2002, AIG repurchased in the open market 10,858,000 shares of its common stock. LIQUIDITY At December 31, 2002, consolidated invested assets were $432.36 billion including $8.16 billion in cash and short term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2002 amounted to $18.69 billion. AIG believes that its liquid assets, cash provided by operations and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any forseeable cash requirements. OUTLOOK Premium rates in the General Insurance business are continuing to strengthen both domestically and in key international markets, along with policy restrictions and exclusions. AIG expects that such growth will continue through 2003. Such increases in premium growth will have a strong positive impact on cash flow available for investment. Thus, General Insurances net investment income is expected to rise in future quarters even in the current interest rate environment. In the Life Insurance segment, AIG expects continued growth with respect to its domestic individual fixed annuity operation, while in overseas markets, AIGs life insurance operations are expected to continue double digit growth. AIG continues to expand its operations in China, becoming the first foreign insurance organization to have wholly owned life insurance operations in Beijing, Suzhou, Dongguan and Jiangmen, as well as previously established 23 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) operations in Shanghai, Foshan, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. AIG also expects India and Vietnam to offer additional opportunities for growth. AIG expects that ILFC will continue its growth and operating profitability even as the airline industry remains under stress. ILFC derives over 80 percent of its lease revenues from foreign carriers, thus limiting its exposure to the domestic commercial aviation market which is significantly more depressed than the rest of the industry. AIG is also optimistic about opportunities for growth in its consumer finance business through continued expansion of overseas credit card operations and alternative distribution systems such as the use of the Internet. During 2003, AIG also expects to expand its recently formed international retirement savings operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements provides a summary of the GAAP accounting policies significant to AIG. Among these policies requiring significant judgment, AIG considers its most critical accounting estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses, future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts, deferred policy acquisition costs, and fair value determinations with respect to certain assets and liabilities of certain of the subsidiaries of AIGs financial services operations. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. Reserves for losses and loss expenses are estimated using data where the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines have limited statistical credibility in reported net losses. (See also the discussions "Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses", "Loss Reserve Charge", and "Asbestos and Environmental Claims" herein.) The liability for future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts include estimates for interest rates, mortality and surrender rates and invested asset performance. (See also the discussion "Life Insurance Operations".) Recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs are contingent upon the underlying insurance operations being profitable. (See also the discussions "General Insurance Operations", "Life Insurance Operations" and "Retirement Savings and Asset Management Operations" herein.) Fair value determinations with respect to certain assets and liabilities of certain subsidiaries of AIGs financial services operations are arrived at through the use of valuation models. (See also the discussion "Managing Market Risk" herein.) OPERATIONAL REVIEW On August 29, 2001, American General Corporation (AGC), was acquired by AIG. In connection with the acquisition, AIG issued approximately 290 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of AGC based on an exchange ratio of 0.5790 of a share of AIG common stock for each share of AGC common stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests and the accompanying financial statements have been prepared to retroactively combine AGCs financial statements with AIGs financial statements. GENERAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS AIGs general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. Domestic general insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG), which includes The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company (HSB); Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic); Personal Lines, including 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century); and Mortgage Guaranty. AIGs Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIGs foreign based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. (See also Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

General Insurance Results NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND NET PREMIUMS EARNED in 2002 increased 36.4 percent and 25.3 percent, respectively, from those of 2001. In 2001, net premiums written increased 14.7 percent and net premiums earned increased 11.2 percent when compared to 2000. Commencing in the latter part of 1999 and continuing through 2002 and into the current quarter, the commercial property casualty market place has experienced rate increases. Virtually all areas of DBG have experienced rate increases as well as maintaining an excellent retention rate for desired renewal business. The vast majority of the increase in 2002 resulted from rate increases with respect to renewed business. Overall, DBGs net premiums written increased $5.02 billion or 49.2 percent in 2002 over 2001. These increases compared to an increase of $2.26 billion or 28.5 percent in 2001 over 2000. DBG produced 55.5 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in 2002, 50.7 percent in 2001 and 45.3 percent in 2000. Personal Lines net premiums written increased 29.7 percent or $728 million in 2002 over 2001, reflecting auto insurance rate increases in many states, compared to a decrease of 2.2 percent or $56 million in 2001 from 2000. Foreign General insurance net premiums written increased 19.0 percent and net premiums earned increased 12.4 percent. Foreign General insurance operations produced 21.9 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in 2002, 25.1 percent in 2001 and 28.4 percent in 2000. In comparing the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of AIGs foreign general operations during 2002 to those foreign currency exchange rates used to translate AIGs Foreign General results during 2001, the U.S. dollar strengthened slightly in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts business. Accordingly, when foreign net premiums written were translated into U.S. dollars for the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, total general insurance net premiums written were approximately 1.2 percentage points less than they would have been if translated utilizing those foreign currency exchange rates which prevailed during 2001. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. 25 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) AIG, along with most general insurance entities, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe for every $100 of net premiums earned or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses, respectively. The combined ratio presents the total cost per $100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. THE STATUTORY GENERAL INSURANCE RATIOS, INCLUDING THE $2.8 BILLION LOSS RESERVE CHARGE IN 2002 AND $769 MILLION OF WTC LOSSES IN 2001, WERE AS FOLLOWS: 2002 2001 2000 Domestic General: Loss Ratio 92.86 85.89 80.99 Expense Ratio 17.72 17.64 17.39 Combined Ratio 110.58 103.53 98.38 Foreign General: Loss Ratio 61.13 60.51 60.71 Expense Ratio 28.99 31.67 31.69 Combined Ratio 90.12 92.18 92.40 Consolidated: Loss Ratio* 85.76 79.55 75.28 Expense Ratio 20.19 21.16 21.45 Combined Ratio 105.95 100.71 96.73 * The impact of the loss reserve charge and the WTC losses on the loss ratio was an increase of 11.54 in 2002 and 3.97 in 2001. AIG believes that underwriting profit is the true measure of the performance of the core business of a general insurance company. Underwriting profit is measured in two ways: statutory underwriting profit and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) underwriting profit. Statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred. Statutory accounting differs from GAAP, as statutory accounting, in general, requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for statutory purposes, expenses are recognized immediately, not over the same period that the revenues are earned. A basic premise of GAAP accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned, the principle of matching. Therefore, to convert underwriting results to a GAAP basis, acquisition expenses are deferred (deferred acquisition costs DAC) and amortized over the period the related premiums written are earned. Accordingly, the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by GAAP. Thus, "adjusted underwriting profit" is a GAAP measurement which can be viewed as gross margin or an intermediate subtotal in calculating operating income and net income. DAC is reviewed for recoverability and such review requires significant management judgment. (See also Notes 1, 2 and 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.) A major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, exclusive of investment income. If underwriting is not profitable, losses incurred are a major factor. The result is that the premiums are inadequate to pay for losses and expenses and produce a profit; therefore, investment income must be used to cover underwriting losses. If assets and the income therefrom are insufficient to pay claims and expenses over extended periods, an insurance company cannot survive. For these reasons, AIG views and manages its underwriting operations separately from its investment operations. (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct impact on pricing and consequently profitability as reflected by adjusted underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios. In 2002, AIGs general insurance results reflect the net impact of the loss reserve charge of $2.8 billion with respect to accident years 1997 through 2001. Such charge was the result of AIGs annual year end review of general insurance loss reserves. (See also the discussion under "Loss Reserve Charge" herein.) In addition, these results reflect the net impact of catastrophe losses approximating $57 million in 2002, $867 million in 2001 (which include $769 million in WTC losses and $50 million with respect to the Northridge earthquake, following the unprecedented decision by the State of California to require all insurers to reopen claims nearly eight years after the occurrence), and $44 million in 2000. On a gross basis, incurred losses included $3.5 billion attributable to the loss reserve charge and approximately $245 million from catastrophes in 2002, and catastrophe losses of $2.15 billion in 2001 (which include $2.0 billion in WTC losses), and $112 million in 2000. With respect to catastrophe losses, AIG believes that it has taken appropriate steps to reduce the magnitude of possible future losses. The occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity, such as a terrorist attack, earthquake or hurricane, that causes insured losses, however, could have a material adverse effect on AIGs results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. Current techniques and models may not accurately predict in the future the probability of catastrophic events and the extent of the resulting losses. Moreover, one or more catastrophe losses could impact negatively AIGs reinsurers and result in an inability of AIG to collect reinsurance recoverables. The impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely 26 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries from year to year, making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult. The pro forma table below excludes the loss reserve charge in 2002, WTC losses in 2001 and catastrophe losses in all three years in order to present comparable results of AIGs ongoing underwriting operations. ON THE BASIS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATUTORY GENERAL INSURANCE RATIOS WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS: 2002 2001 2000 Published Loss Ratio 85.76 79.55 75.28 Loss reserve charge (11.54) WTC Losses (3.97) Catastrophes (0.23) (0.50) (0.25) Pro Forma 73.99 75.08 75.03 Expense Ratio 20.19 21.16 21.45 Combined Ratio 94.18 96.24 96.48 AIGs historic ability to maintain its combined pro forma ratio below 100 is primarily attributable to the profitability of AIGs Foreign General insurance operations and AIGs emphasis on maintaining its disciplined underwriting, especially in the domestic specialty markets. In addition, AIG does not seek premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures. GENERAL INSURANCE NET INVESTMENT INCOME in 2002 decreased 4.6 percent when compared to 2001. In 2001, net investment income increased 7.1 percent over 2000. The decrease in net investment income in 2002 was primarily a result of lower earnings with respect to the general insurance private equity portfolio. Also, interest income earned from the general insurance bond portfolio was impacted by lower yields as the proceeds from maturing fixed income securities were reinvested. However, the cash flow resulting from the growth in net premiums written should have a positive impact on net investment income in future quarters. The growth in net investment income in 2001 and 2000 was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment. The new cash flow was generated from net general insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein and Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.) GENERAL INSURANCE REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES were $858 million in 2002 and $130 million in 2001, and realized capital gains were $38 million in 2000. These realized gains and losses resulted from the ongoing investment management of the general insurance portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities. (See the discussion on "Valuation of Invested Assets" herein.) THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES GENERAL INSURANCE OPERATING INCOME ON A GAAP BASIS TO MANAGEMENTS PRESENTATION HEREIN: (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 As reported $ 667 $ 2,851 $ 3,524 Loss reserve charge 2,800 WTC losses 769 Realized capital (gains) losses 858 130 (38) As adjusted Management reporting basis $ 4,325 $ 3,750 $ 3,486 GENERAL INSURANCE OPERATING INCOME in 2002 decreased 76.6 percent when compared to 2001. This decline in the growth rate was caused by the $2.8 billion loss reserve charge as well as the $728 million increase in realized capital losses in 2002. If such loss reserve charge and realized capital losses were excluded from 2002 general insurance operations and the WTC losses and realized capital losses were excluded from 2001 general insurance operations, the growth in 2002 when compared to 2001 would be 15.4 percent. General insurance operating income in 2001 decreased 19.1 percent when compared to 2000 primarily due to the WTC losses. If the WTC losses, as well as realized capital losses, were excluded from 2001 general insurance operations and realized capital gains were excluded from 2000 general insurance operations, the increase would be 7.6 percent to $3.75 billion during 2001. The contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes was 8.2 percent in 2002 compared to 35.0 percent in 2001 and 35.2 percent in 2000. If the loss reserve charge in 2002 and the WTC losses in 2001 were excluded from each years general insurance operating income and each of these years excluded realized capital losses or gains, as well as acquisition, restructuring and related charges were excluded from income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2001 and 2000, the general insurance operating income contribution to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes would be 32.3 percent, 31.5 percent and 32.7 percent in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Reinsurance AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs. AIG insures risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. These reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds. 27 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) AIGS GENERAL REINSURANCE ASSETS amounted to $28.77 billion and resulted from AIGs reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 2002 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 2002, approximately 40 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers. In order to obtain statutory recognition, the majority of these balances were collateralized. The remaining 60 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 90 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated A (excellent) or better, as rated by A.M. Best. This rating is a measure of financial strength. The terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories, not creditworthiness. AIG maintains an allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance and has been largely successful in its previous recovery efforts. At December 31, 2002, AIG had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating $120 million. At that date, AIG had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled (e.g., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction). AIGs Reinsurance Security Department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. Such assessments include, but are not limited to, identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, and has sufficient financial capacity, and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. This department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral. In addition, AIGs Credit Risk Committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer. AIG enters into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for its general and life operations. AIG enters these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. At December 31, 2002, the consolidated general reinsurance assets of $28.77 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of $4.19 billion and $21.19 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses, including ceded losses incurred but not reported (IBNR) (ceded reserves). The ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments thereto are reflected in income currently. It is AIGs belief that the ceded reserves at December 31, 2002 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded. Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses THE TABLE BELOW CLASSIFIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 THE COMPONENTS OF THE GENERAL INSURANCE RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES (LOSS RESERVES) WITH RESPECT TO MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS ON A STATUTORY BASIS*: (in millions) Other Liability Occurrence $14,132 Other Liability Claims Made 8,559 Workers Compensation 6,064 Auto Liability 4,290 International 2,797 Property 2,691 Reinsurance 1,591 Medical Malpractice 1,560 Aircraft 1,448 Products Liability 1,262 Accident & Health 1,009 Fidelity/Surety 875 Other 5,261 Total $51,539 * Presented pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. At December 31, 2002, the loss reserves amounted to $51.54 billion. These loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR and loss expenses. Certain of these loss reserves are discounted. These discounted reserves relate primarily to certain workers compensation claims. At December 31, 2002, general insurance net loss reserves increased $4.45 billion from prior year end to $30.35 billion. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently. It is managements belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2002. While AIG annually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIGs ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially exceed AIGs loss reserves as of December 31, 2002. In the future, if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations. See "Loss Reserve Charge" below. In a very broad sense, the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups, one group being long tail casualty lines of business. Such lines include excess and umbrella liability, directors and officers liability, professional liability, medical malpractice, general liability, products 28 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries liability, and related classes. The other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines, personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines. Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. In the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses. That is, a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. A relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be IBNR. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximated six percent. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms; current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs. Therefore, AIGs carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business. In the evaluation of AIGs net loss reserves, loss trend factors vary, depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. See "Loss Reserve Charge" below. Estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines. Loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines. For example, if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property, the growth in propertys exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased. AIGs annual reserve review does not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates. Because AIGs general insurance business is primarily in volatile long tail casualty lines driven almost entirely by severity rather than frequency of claims, developing a range around loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful. An estimate is calculated which AIGs actuaries believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve. This amount is evaluated against actual carried reserves. It should also be noted that AIGs overall book of business consists of hundreds of segments or classes of business that are individually reviewed as part of the overall analysis of loss reserves. Most of these would fall into the category of longer tail lines of business. Due to the multitude of such classes and the volume of detail for each, it would not be possible to provide complete claim frequency, settlement, closure and other data for all such segments, nor does AIG believe that such disclosure by class of business would be meaningful or useful to the reader. It should be noted that none of the other segments or classes reflects the highly uncertain qualities that apply to the asbestos and environmental claims. For example, traditional actuarial methodologies can be applied to classes such as excess casualty, directors and officers liability, healthcare, and the other long tail coverages that AIG writes. These methodologies cannot be applied to asbestos and environmental exposures. Other than asbestos and environmental exposures, there is no area of significant exposure to AIG for which traditional actuarial methodologies cannot be applied. For other property and short tail casualty lines, the loss trend is implicitly assumed to develop at the rate that reported net losses develop from one year to the next. The concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines. Loss Reserve Charge Following completion of its annual year end net loss reserve study, AIG increased general insurance loss and loss adjustment reserves, incurring a net, after tax charge of $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002.

AIGs method for determining reserves for volatile long tail lines relies on the use of expected loss ratios such as the method known as the "Bornhuetter/Ferguson" method. This methodology essentially ignores all recent accident years for which loss development is too immature to give reliable results and, instead, bases the reserve estimate on the more mature prior accident year results. In its 2002 year end analysis, AIG observed that the more recent immature accident years were showing significant increases in loss development. As a result, AIG modified its historical assumptions in producing an estimate of required reserves. A key modification was to give additional weight to the actual loss development in the immature years. For example, for AIGs excess casualty lead umbrella segment, AIG used the loss development for accident year 1999, even though that development normally would be considered too immature to produce reliable results (and therefore, not used under historical assumptions). Another key change for the most recent accident years (generally accident years 2000, 2001, 2002) is, although AIG continued to use actuarial assumptions that rely on expected loss ratios (such as the Bornhuetter/Ferguson method mentioned above), the expected loss ratio assumptions used gave far greater weight to more recent accident year experience than was the case in the historical assumptions. For example, for the excess casualty lead umbrella segment described above, AIG actuaries gave 100 percent weight to the results of the 1997 through 1999 accident years only, giving no weight to the more favorable development of all prior years, in setting expected loss ratio assumptions for accident years 2000 to 2002. Again, using the lead umbrella segment as an example, rather than using the historical trend factor of 2.5 percent per year as actually experienced, AIG used 7.5 percent as the annual loss cost trend factor reflecting the more current experience. Loss development trends for volatile long tail lines such as excess casualty and directors and officers liability have not followed any consistent trend. This has at times led to overstated loss ratio projections and is a key reason why AIG has customarily utilized the historical projection (Bornhuetter/ Ferguson) method. For long tail lines, judgment is required in analyzing the appropriate weighting of current trends to avoid overreacting to data anomalies that may distort such current trends. AIGs annual loss reserve review commences late in the third quarter and is completed late in the fourth quarter of each year. Although the year end 2001 annual loss reserve review, completed approximately one year ago, did show some indications of adverse development from most of the classes which required the increase in 2002, at that time, the indicated amount of reserve increase needed was immaterial. Furthermore, it was believed that the potential risk of adverse development from those reserves was mitigated for purposes of the overall loss development by what appeared at the time to be a potential redundancy in the adequacy of the unearned premium reserve as of year end 2001 as premium rates had been increased sharply in 2001. During 2002, however, there was substantial adverse development in AIGs excess casualty and directors and officers lines of business, as well as lesser amounts in certain other classes, including healthcare liability. These adverse developments were significant enough to not only cause a deficiency in the level of carried reserves, but to also suggest that AIGs assumptions for testing its reserves needed to be modified to account for the development in loss trends that was emerging for 1997 and subsequent accident years (as more fully discussed above). Using the modified assumptions, AIGs actuaries conducted further analysis of the reserves required as of December 31, 2002. Given the accuracy of the historical approach and the uncertainty of the more recent trends, AIG decided to give approximately equal weight to both sets of assumptions in establishing the carried reserves as of December 31, 2002. Given the scope and complexity of AIGs general insurance operations and the extensive work and time required to review reserves, AIGs annual year end loss reserve review commences late in the third quarter. Recognition of the adverse development occurred at the end of the fourth quarter of 2002 as this was the quarter in which the year end 2002 loss reserve review was completed. The year end 2001 loss reserve review indicated that AIGs carried reserves as of year end 2001 were reasonable. As described above, the trend AIG recognized as driving the change in the estimate is the adverse loss cost trend which occurred beginning with accident year 1997 and continued and accelerated in accident years 1998 and 1999. The increase in loss trends is concentrated in high severity coverages, such as excess casualty, excess workers compensation, directors and officers liability, and healthcare liability. The change in the estimate correlates with this trend. Asbestos and Environmental Claims AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. AIG established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and environmental claim units, which investigate and adjust all such asbestos and environmental claims. These units utilize a comprehensive ground up approach to claim adjusting by thoroughly evaluating each exposure on a claim by claim basis. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented. However, AIG currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and has excluded such claims from the analyses included herein. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process. These asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described. Quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment. Significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court 30 AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involves issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties. In the interim, AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues. At the current time, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims. Such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage issues. Although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims, the reserves carried for these claims at December 31, 2002 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law. Furthermore, as AIGs net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years, the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves. In the future, if the environmental claims develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations. (See the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein.) The majority of AIGs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case basis. In asbestos, for example, AIG has resolved all claims with respect to miners and product manufacturers (Tier 1), for which payments are completed or reserves are established to cover future payment obligations. Asbestos claims with respect to products containing asbestos (Tier 2) accounts are generally very mature losses, and have been appropriately recognized and reserved by AIGs asbestos claims operation. AIG believes that the vast majority of the incoming claims, with respect to products containing small amounts of asbestos and companies in the distribution chain and parties with remote, ill defined involvement with asbestos (Tier 3 and 4), should not impact its coverage; this is due to a combination of factors, including the increasingly peripheral companies being named in asbestos litigation, smaller limits issued to peripheral defendants, tenuous liability cases against peripheral defendants, attachment points of the excess policies, and the manner in which resolution of these weaker cases would be allocated among all insurers, including non AIG companies, over a long period of time.

Best, an insurance rating agency, has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that companys current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments. This is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years. Therefore, the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments. The higher the ratio, the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments. These ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year. Such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments. It should be noted, however, that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves, ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio. The developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments. Involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments, court orders, covered claims with no coverage defenses, state mandated cleanup costs, claims where AIGs coverage defenses are minimal, and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting. Also, AIG considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary. AIG believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio. The special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages AIGs asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites. As a result, AIG reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies. AIGS SURVIVAL RATIOS FOR INVOLUNTARY ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEPARATELY AND COMBINED, WERE BASED UPON A THREE YEAR AVERAGE PAYMENT. THESE RATIOS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000 WERE AS FOLLOWS: Gross Net 2002 INVOLUNTARY SURVIVAL RATIOS: ASBESTOS 4.1 4.9 ENVIRONMENTAL 17.6 13.3 COMBINED 7.3 7.9 2001 Involuntary survival ratios: Asbestos 3.3 4.3 Environmental 18.7 16.5 Combined 6.8 8.7 2000 Involuntary survival ratios: Asbestos 3.6 6.8 Environmental 20.0 16.9 Combined 7.6 11.5 AIGs operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities. Therefore, the ultimate net 32 AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES assessment cannot reasonably be estimated. The guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $76 million, $24 million and $15 million, respectively. AIG is also required to participate in various involuntary pools (principally workers compensation business) which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets. This participation is also recorded upon notification, as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated. LIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS AIGs life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of fixed and variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts and pensions. (See also Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

This decline in the growth rate was caused by the $799 million increase in realized capital losses. If such losses were excluded from both the 2002 and 2001 life insurance operating income and WTC losses of $131 million excluded from 2001 life operating income, the growth in 2002 life operating income when compared to 2001 life operating income would be 18.2 percent. THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES THE LIFE OPERATING INCOME REPORTED ON A GAAP BASIS TO THE PRESENTATION AIG MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS MOST MEANINGFUL: (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 As reported $4,929 $4,675 $4,058 WTC losses 131 Realized capital losses 1,053 254 162 As adjusted Management reporting basis $5,982 $5,060 $4,220 The contribution of life insurance operating income to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and excluding acquisition, restructuring and related charges amounted to 60.5 percent in 2002 compared to 46.0 percent in 2001 and 39.3 percent in 2000. The increase in contribution percentage was influenced by the impact of the general insurance loss reserve charge in 2002 and the WTC losses in 2001 on general insurance operating income and its reduced contribution to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes. If the loss reserve charge and realized capital losses were excluded from 2002 income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and WTC losses from 2001 and realized capital losses and acquisition restructuring and related charges were excluded from 2001 and 2000 income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes, the contribution of life operating income to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes would be 44.7 percent, 42.6 percent and 39.6 percent in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. AIGS GAAP LIFE PREMIUM INCOME IN 2002 REPRESENTED A 6.6 PERCENT INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. The slowing in growth in 2002 reflected lower demand and sales of annuities in connection with corporate pension restructuring activities in domestic operations. This compares with an increase of 11.1 percent in 2001 over 2000. Foreign life operations produced 77.3 percent, 74.0 percent and 72.0 percent of the GAAP life premium income in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. (See also Notes 1, 4 and 6 of Notes to Financial Statements.) The traditional life products, particularly individual life products, were major contributors to the growth in foreign premium income. These traditional life products, coupled with the increased distribution of financial and investment products contributed to the growth in foreign investment income. A mixture of traditional, accident and health and financial products are being sold in Japan through ALICO and AIG Star Life. Since AIG purchased AIG Star Life, a part of the income earned by AIG Star Life has resulted from surrender charges earned on policies that were either surrendered or lapsed. This favorable impact on operating income was anticipated when AIG took control. As these surrenders diminish in subsequent periods, operating income from that source will also be impacted. The majority of AIG Star Lifes future income is expected to be related to continuing premiums paid on renewal business, and new business to be generated from a growing agency force. As previously discussed, the U.S. dollar strengthened slightly in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts business. Accordingly for 2002, when foreign life premium income was translated into U.S. dollars for purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, total life premium income was approximately 1.6 percentage points less than it would have been if translated utilizing exchange rates prevailing in 2001. LIFE INSURANCE NET INVESTMENT INCOME increased 10.7 percent in 2002 compared to an increase of 11.3 percent in 2001. The growth in net investment income was attributable to both foreign and domestic new cash flow for investment. The new cash flow was generated from life insurance operations and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) LIFE INSURANCE REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES were $1.05 billion in 2002, $254 million in 2001 and $162 million in 2000. These realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing investment management of the life insurance portfolios within the overall objectives of the life insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities. (See also the discussion on "Valuation of Invested Assets" herein.) Underwriting and Investment Risk The risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk. The risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is primarily investment risk. Underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses. AIGs foreign life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of 34 AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES a single life to approximately $1.5 million dollars of coverage and AIGs domestic life companies, limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to $2.5 million of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance. (See also Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements and the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) The investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets, primarily long term fixed rate investments, being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments. (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) To minimize its exposure to investment risk, AIG tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit. If a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur, a demand could be placed upon liquidity. (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) The asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in AIGs foreign operations, as it has been throughout AIGs history, even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities. For example, in Japan and several Southeast Asia territories, the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities. Therefore, there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities. Additionally, there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. To maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities, constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts while continuing to maintain satisfactory investment quality. To the extent permitted under local regulation, AIG may invest in qualified longer term securities outside Japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield. AIG is able to manage any asset liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network. (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein.) The asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in AIGs domestic operations, as there is ample supply of qualified long term investments. AIG uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies. As a part of these strategies, AIG may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes. For the ALICO operations in Japan, the variable life contract separate account fund performance has varied from the level assumed in the original pricing of the product. Thus, a general account liability has been established for the potential shortfall of future contract revenues. The ultimate liability is predominately dependent upon the fund performance in the future. Deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) for life insurance products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Policy acquisition costs which relate to universal life and investment type products (non traditional life products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less interest required as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses. Current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the impact on the amortization of DAC. The estimation of projected gross profits requires significant management judgment. The elements with respect to the current and projected gross profits are reviewed and analyzed quarterly and are appropriately adjusted. DAC for both traditional life and non traditional life products are subject to review for recoverability, which involve estimating the future profitability of current business. This review also involves significant management judgment.

(See also Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.) FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS FOR 2002, 2001 AND 2000 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Revenues: ILFC (a) $ 2,845 $ 2,613 $ 2,441 AIGFP (b) 1,306 1,178 1,056 Consumer Finance (c) 2,473 2,560 2,325 Other 191 134 132 Total $ 6,815 $ 6,485 $ 5,954 Operating income: ILFC $ 801 $ 749 $ 654 AIGFP 808 758 648 Consumer Finance 549 505 386 Other, including intercompany adjustments 31 (21) (22) Total $ 2,189 $ 1,991 $ 1,666 (a) Revenues were primarily from aircraft lease rentals. (b) Revenues were primarily fees from proprietary positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. (c) Revenues were primarily finance charges. FINANCIAL SERVICES RESULTS FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATING INCOME increased 9.9 percent in 2002 over 2001. This compares with an increase of 19.5 percent in 2001 over 2000. Financial services operating income represented 26.9 percent of AIGs income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and excluding acquisition, restructuring and related charges in 2002. This compares to 19.6 percent and 16.1 percent in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in contribution percentage was influenced by the impact of the general insurance loss reserve charge in 2002 and the WTC losses in 2001 on general insurance operating income and its reduced contribution to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes. ILFC generates its revenues primarily from leasing commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for its own account, for airlines and for financial institutions. Revenues in 2002 increased 8.9 percent from 2001 compared to an 7.0 percent increase during 2001 from 2000. The revenue growth in each year resulted primarily from the increase in flight equipment under operating lease and the increase in the relative cost of the leased fleet. ILFC has historically derived over 80 percent of its lease revenues with respect to flight equipment from airlines based outside the United States and is not significantly exposed to current domestic airline difficulties. ILFC has historically re leased aircraft returning at the end of a lease before the aircraft returns to ILFC. For aircraft returning before the end of their lease terms, ILFC has generally been able to re lease aircraft returned from the prior lessee within two to three months of its return. As a lessor, ILFC considers an aircraft "idle" or "off lease" when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent. ILFC had one aircraft off lease at December 31, 2002 which had been off lease for less than three months. No impairments have been recognized related to these aircraft as ILFC believes that the existing service potential of the aircraft in ILFCs portfolio has not been diminished and ILFC has been able to re lease the aircraft without diminution in lease rates from those previously obtained that would require an impairment write down. ILFC management is very active in the airline industry. Management formally reviews regularly, and no less frequently than quarterly, issues affecting ILFCs fleet, including events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft values. Management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary, based on these events and circumstances in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (FAS 144). No impairments have been recognized related to these aircraft. (See also the discussions under "Liquidity" herein.) During 2002, ILFCs operating income increased 6.9 percent from 2001 and 14.6 percent during 2001 from 2000. ILFC finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments. The composite borrowing rates at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were 4.73 percent, 5.07 percent and 6.37 percent, respectively. (See also the discussions under "Capital Resources" and "Liquidity" herein and Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.) ILFC is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through non performance of aircraft lessees, through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease. ILFC manages its lessee non performance exposure through credit reviews and security deposit requirements. As a result of these measures and its own contingency planning, ILFC did not suffer any material losses from airline shutdowns in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, but there can be no assurance that ILFC will successfully manage the risks relating to the impact of possible future deterioration in the airline industry. Approximately 86 percent of ILFCs fleet is leased to non U.S. carriers, and this fleet, the most efficient in the airline industry, continues to be in high demand from such carriers. (See also the discussions under "Capital Resources" and "Liquidity" herein.) AIGFP participates in the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity and credit derivative products business. AIGFP also enters into structured transactions including long dated 36 AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES forward foreign exchange contracts, option transactions, liquidity facilities and investment agreements and invests in a diversified portfolio of securities. AIGFP derives substantially all its revenues from proprietary positions entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than from speculative transactions. As a dealer, AIGFP marks its transactions daily to fair value. Thus, a gain or loss on each transaction is recognized daily. AIGFP hedges the market risks arising from its transactions. Therefore, revenues and operating income are not significantly exposed to or affected by market fluctuations and volatility. Revenues of AIGFP and the percentage change in revenues for any given period are significantly affected by the number and size of transactions entered into by AIGFP during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period. Operating income and the percentage change in operating income for any period are determined by the number, size and profitability of the transactions attributable to that period relative to those attributable to the prior period. The realization of operating income as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant event as the profit or loss on each of AIGFPs transactions has already been reflected in operating income. Revenues in 2002 increased 10.9 percent from 2001 compared to a 11.6 percent increase during 2001 from 2000. During 2002, operating income increased 6.6 percent from 2001 and increased 17.0 percent during 2001 from 2000. As AIGFP is a transaction oriented operation, current and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for predicting future performance. THE BREAKDOWN BY PERCENTAGE CONTRIBUTION OF REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME FOR AIGFP IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000 IS SET FORTH BELOW. THE PERCENTAGES FOR OPERATING INCOME ARE THE SAME AS THOSE FOR REVENUES BECAUSE EXPENSES ARE ALLOCATED ACROSS ALL PRODUCTS IN PROPORTION TO THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THAT PRODUCT. MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME ARE NOT MEANINGFUL BECAUSE OF THE TRANSACTIONAL NATURE OF AIGFPS BUSINESS. 2002 2001 2000 Spread Income on Investments and Borrowings 48% 36% 32% Interest Rate Products 19 29 30 Equity Linked Products 3 14 25 Credit Linked Products 29 11 12 Other revenue 1 10 1 Financial market conditions in 2002 compared with 2001 were characterized by a continuing decline in interest rates across fixed income markets globally, a worldwide slump in credit prices with the concomitant widening of credit spreads, and a continuing decline in equity valuations. AIGFPs results in 2002 compared with 2001 reflected a shift in product segment activity to respond to these conditions. In particular, AIGFP experienced increases in demand for credit linked products that addressed the risk management needs of its counterparties (see also the discussion under "Derivatives" herein). The increase in spread income on investments and borrowings reflected the widening of credit spreads, as well as an increase in asset class diversification. Finally, the sharp decline in equity linked products reflected substantially reduced demand for products that hedge appreciated equity positions. Derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of AIGFPs business. Therefore, income on interest rate, equity and credit derivatives along with their related hedges are recorded on a mark to market value or at estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in the income statement in the current year. In 2002, less than five percent of revenues resulted from transactions valued at estimated fair value. The mark to fair value of derivative transactions is reflected in the balance sheet in the captions "Unrealized gain on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions" and "Unrealized loss on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions". The unrealized gain represents the net receivable from counterparties, and the unrealized loss represents the net payable to counterparties. These amounts will change from one period to the next due to changes in interest rates, currency rates, equity prices and other market variables, as well as cash movements, execution of new transactions and the maturing of existing transactions. Spread income on investments and borrowings are recorded on an accrual basis over the life of the transaction. Investments are classified as available for sale securities and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in the equity section. The most significant component of AIGFPs operating expenses is compensation, which approximated 36 percent, 31 percent and 31 percent of revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Domestically, AIGs consumer finance operations derive a substantial portion of their revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding mortgages and finance receivables from the sub prime market, while overseas operations are engaged in developing a multi product consumer finance business with an emphasis on emerging markets. Revenues in 2002 decreased 3.4 percent from 2001 compared to a 10.1 percent increase during 2001 from 2000, but 2002 operating income increased 8.9 percent from 2001 and 30.8 percent during 2001 from 2000. The decline in revenues was the result of lower yields on the finance receivables, but borrowing costs also declined significantly so that spreads, and therefore profits, increased as a result. The growth in revenues during 2001 was generally due to the growth in the average finance receivables. The increases in operating income resulted from the growth in finance charges inuring from larger loan balances and improved credit quality of the receivables portfolio, partially offset by lower yields on finance receivables in 2001. (See also the discussions under "Capital Resources" and "Liquidity" herein.) 37 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Consumer finance operations are exposed to loss when contractual payments are not received; collection exposure is managed through the mix of types of loans and security thereon. (See also Notes 8 and 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.) RETIREMENT SAVINGS & ASSET MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS AIGs retirement savings & asset management operations offer a wide variety of investment products, including variable annuities and mutual funds, as well as investment services, including investment asset management. Such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas. For variable annuities, AIGs policy has been to adjust amortization assumptions for deferred acquisition costs (DAC) when estimates of current or future gross profits to be realized from these contracts are revised. With respect to variable annuities sold domestically (representing the vast majority of AIGs variable annuity business), the assumption for the long term annual net growth rate of the equity markets used in the determination of DAC amortization is approximately 10 percent. A methodology referred to as "reversion to the mean" is used to maintain this long term net growth rate assumption, while giving consideration to short term variations in equity markets. A number of guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) and other similar benefits are offered on variable annuities. GMDB related contract benefits incurred, net of reinsurance were $77 million, $20 million and $3 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The significant increase in 2002 is directly related to the worldwide slump in equity markets. In accordance with GAAP, AIG expenses these benefits in the period incurred. With respect to the other benefits, substantially all of AIGs policy obligations are reinsured. RETIREMENT SAVINGS & ASSET MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS FOR 2002, 2001 AND 2000 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Revenues: AIG VALIC $2,133 $2,110 $2,230 AIG SunAmerica 563 652 750 Other* 789 950 485 Total $3,485 $3,712 $3,465 Operating income: AIG VALIC $ 730 $ 630 $ 692 AIG SunAmerica 32 185 326 Other* 254 273 90 Total $1,016 $1,088 $1,108 * Includes AIG Global Investment Group, John McStay Investment Counsel, L.P. and certain overseas variable annuity operations. Retirement Savings & Asset Management Results RETIREMENT SAVINGS & ASSET MANAGEMENT OPERATING INCOME decreased 6.6 percent in 2002 from 2001, reflecting the continued volatility in worldwide equity markets. This compares with a decrease of 1.8 percent in 2001 from 2000. Retirement savings & asset management operating income represented 12.5 percent of AIGs income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and excluding acquisition, restructuring and related charges. This compares to 10.7 percent in both 2001 and 2000. At December 31, 2002, AIGs third party assets under management, including both retail mutual funds and institutional accounts, approximated $40 billion. OTHER OPERATIONS Other realized capital losses amounted to $530 million, $452 million and $190 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Other income (deductions) net includes income generated by the investment of capital held by AIG SunAmerica outside of its life insurance subsidiaries, AIGs equity in certain minor majority owned subsidiaries and certain partially owned companies, realized foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in substantially all currencies and unrealized gains and losses in hyperinflationary currencies, as well as the income and expenses of the parent holding company and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Other income (deductions) net amounted to $(129) million, $3 million and $172 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This decline was primarily the result of weaker performance of 38 AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AIG SunAmerica investments in partnerships and private equities and 21st Centurys third quarter 2002 pre tax charge of $37 million to write off capitalized costs associated with a software development project. Acquisition, restructuring and related charges of $2.02 billion were incurred in 2001 in connection with the acquisition of AGC, including $654 million paid by AGC in connection with the termination of AGCs merger agreement with Prudential plc. Charges of $315 million in 2000 were incurred by AGC in connection with acquisitions by AGC prior to its acquisition by AIG. (See also Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.) Income before income taxes and minority interest amounted to $8.14 billion in 2002. Income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to $8.14 billion in 2001. Income before income taxes and minority interest amounted to $10.02 billion in 2000. In 2002, AIG recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.33 billion compared to the provisions of $2.34 billion and $2.97 billion in 2001 and 2000, respectively. These provisions represent effective tax rates of 28.6 percent in 2002, 28.7 percent in 2001 and 29.6 percent in 2000. (See Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.) Minority interest represents minority shareholders equity in income of certain majority owned consolidated subsidiaries. Minority interest amounted to $295 million, $301 million and $413 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Income before the cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to $5.52 billion in 2002, $5.50 billion in 2001 and $6.64 billion in 2000. Net income amounted to $5.52 billion in 2002, $5.36 billion in 2001 and $6.64 billion in 2000. The increase in 2002 and the decrease in 2001 in net income over the three year period resulted from those factors described above. CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2002, AIG had total capital funds of $59.10 billion and total borrowings of $71.89 billion. At that date, $64.98 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) or matched notes and bonds payable.

See also Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. During 2002, AIGFP increased the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its notes and bonds payable to $16.94 billion. AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities and derivative transactions. The funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. (See also the discussions under "Operational Review", "Liquidity" and "Derivatives" herein and Notes 1, 2, 8, 9, and 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.) AIG Funding, Inc. (Funding), through the issuance of commercial paper, helps fulfill the short term cash requirements of AIG and its subsidiaries. Funding intends to continue to meet AIGs funding requirements through the issuance of commercial paper guaranteed by AIG. The issuance of Fundings commercial paper is subject to the approval of AIGs Board of Directors. ILFC and A.I. Credit Corp. (AICCO), AIG Credit Card Company (Taiwan) (AIGCCC Taiwan) and AIG Finance (Taiwan) Limited (AIGF Taiwan), both consumer finance subsidiaries in Taiwan, AGC and AGF have issued commercial paper for the funding of their own operations. At December 31, 2002, AIG did not guarantee the commercial paper of any of its subsidiaries other than Funding. On July 8, 2002, AGC ceased issuing commercial paper under its program. AGCs funding requirements are now being met through Fundings commercial paper program. (See also the discussion under "Derivatives" herein and Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.) AIG and Funding are parties to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities (collectively, the Facility) aggregating $2.75 billion. The Facility consists of $1.375 billion in a short term revolving credit facility and $1.375 billion in a five year revolving credit facility. The Facility can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for Fundings commercial paper programs. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under the Facility, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2002. AGF is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities aggregating $3.0 billion. The facilities consist of $1.5 billion in a short term revolving credit facility and $1.5 billion in a five year revolving credit facility, which support AGFs commercial paper borrowings. There are currently no borrowings under these facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2002. AGF had $4.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered and available for issuance at December 31, 2002. AGF uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds for the funding of its finance receivables. As of November 2001, AIG guaranteed the notes and bonds of AGC. During 2002, AGC issued $200 million in notes which matured in March 2003. These notes are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. ILFC is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities aggregating $3.15 billion to support its commercial paper program. The facilities consist of $2.15 billion in a short term revolving credit facility and $1.0 billion in a three year revolving credit facility. There are currently no borrowings under these facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, ILFC had increased the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its medium term and long term notes to $14.80 billion, a net increase of $2.91 billion, and recorded a net decline in its capital lease obligations of $104 million and a net increase in its commercial paper of $719 million. ILFC had $6.08 billion of debt securities registered for public sale at December 31, 2002. During the second quarter of 2002, ILFC expanded its Euro Medium Term Note Program from $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion, under which $2.31 billion in notes were sold through December 31, 2002. Notes issued under this program are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit Facility for use in connection with the purchase of approximately 75 aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility was guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on these borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At December 31, 2002, ILFC had $2.09 billion outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. Borrowings with respect to this facility are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. The proceeds of ILFCs debt financing are primarily used to purchase flight equipment, including progress payments during the construction phase. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight 40 AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. (See also the discussions under "Operational Review" and "Liquidity" herein.) AIGFP has established a Euro Medium Term Note Program under which an aggregate principal amount of up to $4.0 billion of notes may be issued. As of December 31, 2002, $2.09 billion of notes had been issued under the program, all of which are currently outstanding. Notes issued under this program are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. During 2002, AIG issued $504 million principal amount of Medium Term Notes, and $48 million of previously issued notes matured. At December 31, 2002, AIG had $140 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time. On November 9, 2001, AIG received proceeds of approximately $1 billion from the issuance of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031 with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of approximately $1.52 billion. Commencing January 1, 2002, the debentures are convertible into shares of AIG common stock at a conversion rate of 6.0627 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures if AIG common stock trades at certain levels for certain time periods. The debentures are callable by AIG on or after November 9, 2006. Also, holders can require AIG to repurchase these debentures once every five years. Capital Funds AIGs capital funds increased $6.95 billion during 2002. Unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes increased $3.15 billion. During 2002, the cumulative translation adjustment loss, net of taxes, increased $381 million. The change for 2002 with respect to the unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes, was primarily impacted by the decrease in domestic interest rates. The 2001 transfer of bonds in the held to maturity at amortized cost to the bonds available for sale at market value in accordance with the transition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," resulted in a gain of $339 million recorded in the statement of comprehensive income as a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment. The 2001 capital funds included a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment gain of $150 million. During 2002, there was a loss of $293 million, net of taxes relating to derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments. (See also the discussion under "Operational Review" and "Liquidity" herein, Notes 1(y) and 8(d) of Notes to Financial Statements and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.) During 2002, retained earnings increased $5.05 billion, resulting from net income less dividends. Stock Repurchase During 2002, AIG repurchased in the open market 10,858,000 shares of its common stock. During 2003 through March 20, 2003 AIG repurchased in the open market an additional 1,625,000 shares of its common stock. AIG intends to continue to buy its common shares in the open market for general corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans. Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by statutory authorities. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities. At December 31, 2002, there were no significant statutory or regulatory issues which would impair AIGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, but there can be no assurance that such issues will not arise in the future. To AIGs knowledge, no AIG company is on any regulatory or similar "watch list". (See also the discussion under "Liquidity" herein and Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.) Regulation and Supervision AIGs insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance companys statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. At December 31, 2002, the adjusted capital of each of AIGs domestic general companies and of each of AIGs domestic life companies exceeded each of their RBC standards. Federal, state or local legislation may affect AIGs ability to operate and expand its various financial services businesses and changes in the current laws, regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses. A substantial portion of AIGs general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIGs insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIGs international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of AIGs operations without compensation. Adverse effects resulting from any one country may impact AIGs results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIGs net financial exposure at that time in that country. 41 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments THE MATURITY SCHEDULE OF AIGS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (in millions) DECEMBER 31, 2002 PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD 2004 2006 REMAINING THROUGH THROUGH YEARS AFTER TOTAL 2003 2005 2007 2007 Borrowings* $62,773 $22,468 $13,485 $ 8,410 $18,410 Operating Leases 2,105 477 594 318 716 Aircraft Purchase Commitments 29,816 4,430 9,807 9,354 6,225 Other Long Term Obligations: ILFC 853 391 462 Other 152 17 46 39 50 Total $95,699 $27,783 $24,394 $18,121 $25,401 *Excludes commercial paper and includes ILFCs capital lease obligations.

(b) Primarily in connection with options to acquire aircraft. Special Purpose Vehicles AIG uses special purposes vehicles (SPVs) primarily in connection with certain guaranteed investment contract programs (GIC Programs) written by its life insurance subsidiaries, certain products provided by AIGFP, and certain invested asset and asset management activities. In the GIC Programs, AIGs life insurance subsidiaries (principally SunAmerica Life Insurance Company) provide guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) to SPVs which are not controlled by AIG. The SPVs issue notes or bonds which are sold to third party institutional investors. Neither AIG nor the insurance company issuing the GICs has any obligation to the investors in the notes or bonds. The proceeds from the securities issued by the SPV are invested by the SPV in the GICs. The insurance company subsidiaries use their proceeds to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, primarily investment grade bonds (see also the discussion under "Liquidity: Insurance Invested Assets"). Both the assets and the liabilities of the insurance companies arising from these GIC Programs are presented in AIGs consolidated balance sheet. Thus, at December 31, 2002, approximately $29 billion of policyholders contract deposits represented liabilities from issuances of GICs included in these GIC Programs, offset by the proceeds from the issuances, which are included as insurance invested assets. AIGFP uses SPVs as an integral part of its ongoing operations with respect to specific structured transactions with independent third parties. In most instances, AIGFP controls and manages the assets and liabilities with respect to these SPVs, subject to certain transaction specific limitations. These SPVs are fully consolidated by AIG (see the discussions of AIGFP under "Operations Review: Financial Services Operations"). AIGFP also sponsors an SPV that issues commercial paper and secured liquidity notes to third party institutional investors. This SPV uses the proceeds of these offerings to obtain beneficial interests in certain financial assets (total assets of approximately $900 million), 42 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries which serve as collateral for the securities issued by the SPV. AIGFP provides credit and liquidity support to this SPV, which is not consolidated by AIG. AIGs insurance operations also invest in assets of SPVs. These SPVs are established by unrelated third parties. Investments include collateralized mortgage backed securities and similar securities backed by pools of mortgages, consumer receivables or other assets. The investment in an SPV allows AIGs insurance entities to purchase assets permitted by insurance regulations while maximizing the return on these assets. AIG provides investment management services to certain SPVs. AIG receives management fees for these services and may take a minority ownership interest in these SPVs, which interests are then included as investments in AIGs consolidated balance sheet. AIG services may be terminated with or without cause. To facilitate and expand certain retirement savings and asset management activities, AIG establishes SPVs. AIG receives fees for management of the assets held in the SPV which support the issuance of securities such as collateralized bond obligations sold by the SPV to independent third party investors. These SPVs serve a variety of business purposes, including financing, liquidity, or to facilitate independent third party management participation. AIG has established stringent guidelines with respect to the formation of and investment in SPVs. (See also the discussion under "Accounting Standards" herein.) LIQUIDITY AIGs liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its general and life insurance operations. At December 31, 2002, AIGs consolidated invested assets included $8.16 billion of cash and short term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2002 amounted to $18.69 billion. Sources of funds considered in meeting the objectives of AIGs financial services operations include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long term and short term debt, maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, issuance of equity, and cash provided from such operations. AIGs strong capital position is integral to managing this liquidity, as it enables AIG to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide. (See also the discussion under "Capital Resources" herein.) Management believes that AIGs liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. In the aggregate, AIGs insurance operations generated approximately $40.3 billion in pre tax cash flow during 2002. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders contract deposits, cash flows from investment operations and paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, and acquisition and operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. AIGs insurance investment operations generated approximately $12.5 billion in investment income cash flow during 2002. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses. (See also the discussions under "Operational Review: General Insurance Operations" and "Life Insurance Operations" herein.) With respect to general insurance operations, if paid losses accelerated beyond AIGs ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, AIG would need to liquidate a portion of its general insurance investment portfolio and or arrange for financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of several catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time. Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable significantly decreased in value. (See also the discussions under "Operational Review: General Insurance Operations" herein.) With respect to life insurance operations, if a substantial portion of the life insurance operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and or defaulted, AIG would need to liquidate other portions of its life insurance investment portfolio and or arrange financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic collapse of a nation or region in which AIG life insurance operations exist, nationalization, terrorist acts or other such economic or political upheaval. (See also the discussions under "Operational Review: Life Insurance Operations" herein.) In addition to the combined insurance pre tax operating cash flow, AIGs insurance operations held $6.88 billion in cash and short term investments at December 31, 2002. Operating cash flow and the cash and short term balances held provided AIGs insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase predominately high quality and diversified fixed income securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities, and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately $120 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately $158 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 2002. 43 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) INVESTED ASSETS THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS A SUMMARY OF AIGS INVESTED ASSETS BY SIGNIFICANT SEGMENT, INCLUDING INVESTMENT INCOME DUE AND ACCRUED OF $4.30 BILLION AND $3.68 BILLION AND REAL ESTATE OF $3.30 BILLION AND $2.65 BILLION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY: (dollars in millions) INVESTED PERCENT ASSETS OF TOTAL 2002 GENERAL INSURANCE $ 55,478 12.8% LIFE INSURANCE 259,138 59.9 FINANCIAL SERVICES 114,878 26.6 OTHER 2,868 0.7 TOTAL $432,362 100.0% 2001 General insurance $ 43,159 11.8% Life insurance 213,776 58.6 Financial services 104,295 28.6 Other 3,722 1.0 Total $364,952 100.0% INSURANCE INVESTED ASSETS THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE THE COMPOSITION OF AIGS INSURANCE INVESTED ASSETS BY INSURANCE SEGMENT, INCLUDING INVESTMENT INCOME DUE AND ACCRUED AND REAL ESTATE, AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001: (dollars in millions) PERCENT DISTRIBUTION GENERAL LIFE PERCENT DECEMBER 31, 2002 INSURANCE INSURANCE TOTAL OF TOTAL DOMESTIC FOREIGN FIXED MATURITIES AT MARKET VALUE (a) $35,990 $206,003 $241,993 76.9% 69.1% 30.9% EQUITY SECURITIES, AT MARKET VALUE (b) 3,928 2,931 6,859 2.2 53.4 46.6 MORTGAGE LOANS ON REAL ESTATE, POLICY AND COLLATERAL LOANS 35 18,901 18,936 6.0 68.8 31.2 SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING TIME DEPOSITS, AND CASH 1,833 5,048 6,881 2.2 42.5 57.5 REAL ESTATE 488 2,367 2,855 0.9 24.8 75.2 INVESTMENT INCOME DUE AND ACCRUED 729 3,489 4,218 1.4 64.2 35.8 SECURITIES LENDING COLLATERAL 7,249 16,445 23,694 7.5 75.8 24.2 OTHER INVESTED ASSETS 5,226 3,954 9,180 2.9 82.1 17.9 TOTAL $55,478 $259,138 $314,616 100.0% 68.6% 31.4% (a) Includes $981 million of bond trading securities, at market value.

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS With respect to fixed maturities, AIGs general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer, industry and or country concentrations. With respect to general insurance, AIGs strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase. With respect to life insurance, AIGs strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities. (See also the discussion under "Operational Review: Life Insurance Operations" herein.) The fair value of the fixed maturity available for sale portfolio is subject to decline as interest rates rise and subject to increase as interest rates decline. Such changes in fair value are presented as a component of comprehensive income in unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes. The fixed maturities held to maturity portfolio were transferred to bonds available for sale, at market value as at January 1, 2001 as permitted and in accordance with the transition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133). (See Note 1(y) of Notes to Financial Statements.) CREDIT QUALITY At December 31, 2002, approximately 69 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities. Approximately 33 percent of such domestic securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately 10 percent were below investment grade or not rated. A significant portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio is rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors (S&P) or similar foreign services. Similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG annually reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments, including mortgages. At December 31, 2002, approximately 16 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIGs internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately 11 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. A large portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance. Any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date. EQUITY INVESTMENTS AIG invests in equities for various reasons, including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk. Equity securities are subject to declines in fair value. Such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes as a component of comprehensive income. VALUATION OF INVESTED ASSETS The valuation of invested assets involves obtaining a market value for each security. The source for the market value is generally from market exchanges, with the exception of non traded securities. Another aspect of valuation pertains to impairment. As a matter of policy, the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of AIGs management and a continual review of its investments. In general, a security is considered a candidate for impairment if it meets any of the following criteria: Trading at a significant discount to par, amortized cost (if lower) or cost for an extended period of time; The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in (i) the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; or (ii) the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims; or In the opinion of AIGs management, it is unlikely that AIG will realize a full recovery on its investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events. Once a security has been identified as potentially impaired, the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous market price. However, the market price following a significant credit event of any issuer may be volatile after such an event. Factors such as market liquidity, hedge fund activity, sensitivity to "headline" risk, and the widening of bid/ask spreads contribute to price volatility. Because of such volatility, the market price may not be indicative of the fair value of such an investment; and consequently, not indicative of a reasonable estimate of realizable value. AIG has the ability to hold any security to its stated maturity. Therefore, the decision to sell reflects the judgment of AIGs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide, on a relative value basis, as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks. With respect to distressed securities, the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale. 45 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As a result of these policies, AIG recorded in 2002 impairment losses net of taxes of approximately $795 million, of which $305 million was recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2002. The most significant impairment charge for any single credit for 2002 was approximately $231 million net of tax with respect to AIGs holdings in WorldCom Inc. (WorldCom). This charge was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2002. Excluding AIGs holdings in WorldCom for 2002, no impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIGs consolidated financial condition or results of operations and no individual impairment loss exceeded approximately 1.4 percent of consolidated net income for 2002. At December 31, 2002, AIG believes that the circumstances which caused WorldComs fair value to significantly decline were not characteristic of AIGs other holdings. AIG measured the impairment charge with respect to WorldCom by reference to the market price of the WorldCom securities as of June 30, 2002. Excluding the impairments noted above, the changes in market value for AIGs available for sale portfolio, which constitutes the vast majority of AIGs investments, were recorded in equity as unrealized gains or losses. At December 31, 2002, the unrealized losses after taxes of the fixed maturity securities were approximately $2.7 billion. At December 31, 2002, the unrealized losses after taxes of the equity securities portfolio were approximately $650 million. At December 31, 2002, aggregate unrealized gains after taxes were $9.6 billion and aggregate unrealized losses after taxes were $3.4 billion. No single issuer accounted for more than three percent of the unrealized losses. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of AIGs fixed maturities and equity securities aggregated to approximately $250.4 billion. Of this aggregate fair value, approximately 1.4 percent represented securities trading at or below 75 percent of amortized cost or cost. The impact on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be further mitigated upon realization, because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policy holder accounts, or realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE UNREALIZED LOSSES AFTER TAXES FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS: (in millions) UNREALIZED LOSSES CONCENTRATION AFTER TAXES INVESTMENT GRADE: Airline related $199 Cable and Media $ 28 Energy $153 Telecommunications $ 55 NOT RATED AND BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE: Airline related $131 Cable and Media $ 76 Energy $492 Telecommunications $111 THE AMORTIZED COST OF FIXED MATURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, BY CONTRACTUAL MATURITY, IS SHOWN BELOW: (in millions) AMORTIZED COST Due in one year or less $ 1,180 Due after one year through five years 7,096 Due after five years through ten years 12,144 Due after ten years 14,517 Total $34,937 In the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, the pre tax realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were $4.1 billion. The aggregate fair value of securities sold was $65.4 billion, which was approximately 94 percent of amortized cost. The average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2002 were trading continuously at a price below book value was approximately eight months. 46 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries THE "AGING" OF PRE TAX UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, IS SHOWN BELOW: (dollars in millions) NUMBER BOOK UNREALIZED NUMBER OF MONTHS VALUE LOSSES* OF ITEMS INVESTMENT GRADE BONDS 0 6 $16,980 $ 917 1,054 7 12 3,852 275 275 >12 5,455 774 513 BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE BONDS 0 6 $ 2,397 $ 433 347 7 12 2,404 524 270 >12 3,849 1,234 470 TOTAL BONDS 0 6 $19,377 $ 1,350 1,401 7 12 6,256 799 545 >12 9,304 2,008 983 EQUITIES 0 6 $ 1,029 $ 217 536 7 12 1,515 591 469 >12 686 217 341 * As more fully described above, upon realization, certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, or realization will result in a current decrease in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs. Note: At December 31, 2002, aggregate pre tax unrealized gains were $14.7 billion. As stated previously, the valuation for AIGs investment portfolio comes from a market exchange, with the exception of non traded securities. AIG considers non traded securities to mean certain fixed income investments, certain structured securities, direct private equities, limited partnerships and hedge funds. The aggregate carrying value of these securities at December 31, 2002 was approximately $29.6 billion. The methodology used to estimate fair value of non traded fixed income investments is by reference to traded securities with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology. This technique takes into account such factors as the industry, the securitys rating and tenor, its coupon rate, its position in the capital structure of the issuer, and other relevant factors. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of unrealized appreciation. For certain structured securities, the carrying value is based on an estimate of the securitys future cash flows pursuant to the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99 20 "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets." The change in carrying value is recognized in income. Direct private equities, hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate less than a five percent interest, are carried at fair value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of Other comprehensive income. With respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest, AIGs carrying value is the net asset value. The changes in such net asset values are recorded in income. AIG obtains the fair value of its investments in limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the sponsors of each of these investments, the accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis. Each of these investment categories is regularly tested to determine if impairment in value exists. Various valuation techniques are used with respect to each category in this determination. MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans comprised 6.0 percent of AIGs insurance invested assets at December 31, 2002. AIGs insurance operations holdings of real estate mortgages amounted to $11.45 billion of which 86.9 percent was domestic. At December 31, 2002, only a nominal amount was in default. It is AIGs practice to maintain a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 percent at loan origination. At December 31, 2002, AIGs insurance holdings of collateral loans amounted to $1.44 billion, all of which were foreign. It is AIGs strategy to enter into mortgage and collateral loans as an adjunct primarily to life insurance fixed maturity investments. AIGs policy loans increased from $5.79 billion at December 31, 2001 to $6.05 billion at December 31, 2002. SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS Short term investments represent amounts invested in various internal and external money market funds, time deposits and cash held. REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AIGs real estate investment properties are primarily occupied by AIGs various operations. The current market value of these properties considerably exceeds their carrying value. OTHER INVESTMENTS Other invested assets were primarily comprised of limited partnerships and outside managed funds. When permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIG and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users. (See also the discussion under "Derivatives" herein.) In certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. These barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds. 47 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Managing Market Risk AIGs insurance operations are exposed to market risk. Market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies. Such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques. One such technique is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management. AIG has performed a VaR analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of AIGs insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment. In this analysis, financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued. Financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders funds. Due to the nature of each insurance segment, AIG manages the general and life insurance operations separately. As a result, AIG manages separately the invested assets of each. Accordingly, the VaR analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of each of AIGs insurance segments as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. AIG uses the historical simulation methodology which entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. In this case, the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios. For each scenario, each transaction was re priced. Portfolio, business unit and finally AIG wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities. The final VaR number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95 percent confidence (i.e., only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the VaR figure). A one month holding period was assumed in computing the VaR figure.

(SEE ALSO THE DISCUSSIONS UNDER "OPERATIONAL REVIEW: FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS", "CAPITAL RESOURCES" AND "DERIVATIVES" HEREIN.) (dollars in millions) 2002 2001 INVESTED PERCENT Invested Percent ASSETS OF TOTAL Assets of Total Flight equipment primarily under operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation $ 26,867 23.4% $ 22,710 21.8% Finance receivables, net of allowance 15,857 13.8 13,955 13.4 Unrealized gain on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions 15,376 13.4 11,493 11.0 Securities available for sale, at market value 16,687 14.5 17,801 17.1 Trading securities, at market value 4,146 3.6 5,733 5.5 Securities purchased under agreements to resell, at contract value 25,560 22.2 21,638 20.7 Trading assets 4,786 4.2 6,234 6.0 Spot commodities, at market value 489 0.4 352 0.3 Other, including short term investments 5,110 4.5 4,379 4.2 Total $114,878 100.0% $104,295 100.0% As previously discussed, the cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ILFCs debt financings. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. During 2002, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing $5.30 billion. (See also the discussion under "Operational Review: Financial Services Operations" and "Capital Resources" herein.) At December 31, 2002, ILFC had committed to purchase 523 aircraft deliverable from 2003 through 2010 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $29.8 billion and had options to purchase 18 aircraft deliverable from 2003 through 2008 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $1.3 billion. Subsequent to December 31, 2002, ILFC cancelled delivery of four of the 523 aircraft. As of March 20, 2003, ILFC has entered into leases for 86 of 90 aircraft to be delivered in 2003 and 49 of 82 aircraft to be delivered in 2004 and 26 of 347 aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2004. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing, but there can be no assurance that such success will continue in future environments. ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, AIG statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a VaR model. In this analysis, the net fair value of ILFC was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt. The estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of ILFC using the historical simulation methodology, as previously described. As of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, the VaR with respect to the net fair value of ILFC was approximately $20 million and $10 million, respectively. AIGs Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products both domestically and overseas. Such products include real estate mortgages, consumer loans, and retail sales finance. These products are funded through various borrowings including commercial paper and medium term notes. AIGs Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. Over half of the loan balance is related to real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties. With respect to credit losses, the allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio. AIGFPs derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that the impact of any such limited 49 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) liquidity would not be significant to AIGs financial condition or its overall liquidity. (See also the discussion under "Operational Review: Financial Services Operations" and "Derivatives" herein.) AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, including securities available for sale, at market, and derivative transactions. The funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing GIAs or other AIGFP financings. (See also the discussion under "Capital Resources" herein.) Securities available for sale is mainly a portfolio of debt securities, where the individual securities have varying degrees of credit risk. At December 31, 2002, the average credit rating of this portfolio was AA or the equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal review. AIGFP has also entered into credit derivative transactions to hedge its credit risk associated with $66 million of these securities. Securities deemed below investment grade at December 31, 2002 amounted to approximately $100 million in fair value representing 0.6 of one percent of the total AIGFP securities available for sale. $30 million of this amount is hedged with a credit derivative. There have been no significant downgrades through March 1, 2003. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized transactions. AIGFP takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIGFP further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and, when AIGFP deems necessary, it requires additional collateral to be deposited. Trading securities, at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGFP is exposed to credit risk. If its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default swap counterparty failed to perform, AIGFP could have a liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFPs debt and, as a result, is responsible for all of AIGFPs obligations. AIG Trading Group Inc. (AIGTG) conducts, as principal, market making and trading activities in foreign exchange, and commodities, primarily precious and base metals. AIGTG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIGTG uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. AIGTG supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities, unrealized losses on swaps, short term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased. (See also the discussions under "Capital Resources" and "Derivatives" herein.) THE GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES OF AIGFP AND AIGTG INCLUDED IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS: (in millions) GROSS GROSS UNREALIZED UNREALIZED GAINS LOSSES Securities available for sale, at market value (a) $ 761 $ 789 Unrealized gain/loss on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions (b) (c) 15,376 11,265 Trading assets 9,271 7,685 Spot commodities, at market value 13 Trading liabilities 1,602 Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value 204 (a) See also Note 8(e) of Notes to Financial Statements. (b) These amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts. (c) At December 31, 2002, AIGTGs replacement values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps were $440 million. AIGFPs interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale, at market, are managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation. At December 31, 2002, the unrealized gains and losses remaining after the benefit of the offsets were $62 million and $90 million, respectively. Trading securities, at market value, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These securities are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for AIGFP and AIGTG. AIGs senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market, operational and credit issues of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior managements of AIGFP and AIGTG report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with AIGs senior management. AIG actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIG must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. 50 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Managing Market Risk Market risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. AIG generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions. AIGs philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried. Credit risk exposure is separately managed. (See the discussion on the management of credit risk below.) AIGs Market Risk Management Department provides detailed independent review of AIGs market exposures, particularly those market exposures of AIGFP and AIGTG. This department determines whether AIGs market risks, as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries, are within the parameters established by AIGs senior management. Well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used. Additionally, this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and the shape and slope of the yield curve. AIGFP hedges its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions such as interest rate swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates. AIGFP hedges its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of currency swaps, options, forwards and futures. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices which affect the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular stock, a basket of stocks or a stock index. AIGFP reduces the risk of loss inherent in its inventory in equity securities by entering into hedging transactions, including equity swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its transactions through an individual offsetting transaction. Rather, AIGFP takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure. AIGFP values its portfolio, including interest rate swaps, currency swaps, equity swaps, swaptions, options and forwards, at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available. Unrealized gains and losses, with respect to this portfolio are reflected in income currently. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of AIGFPs transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by AIGFPs and AIGs management. AIGFP evaluates the portfolios discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models. These models utilize, among other things, market liquidity and current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. AIGFP attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription services such as from Bloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model. When such prices are not available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. Historically, actual results have not materially deviated from these models. These valuation models are integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio, as described above, in order to provide timely information for the market risk management of the portfolio. Based upon this evaluation, AIGFP determines what, if any, offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio. AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate. The recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity. Additionally, depending upon the changes in interest rates and other market movements during the day, AIGFPs system will produce reports for managements consideration for intra day offsetting positions. Overnight, the system generates reports which recommend the types of offsets management should consider for the following day. Additionally, AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the clock. Therefore, offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any AIGFP office in the world. As part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk, AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements. These techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio. In addition to the daily monitoring, AIGFPs senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges. This review includes an examination of the portfolios risk measures, such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables. AIGFPs management may change these measures to reflect 51 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets. This management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio. All of AIGTGs market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes. The fair values of AIGTGs financial instruments are exposed to market risk as a result of adverse market changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and adverse changes in the liquidity of the markets in which AIGTG trades. AIGTGs approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk AIGTG expects to reduce. AIGTGs senior management has established positions and stop loss limits for each line of business. AIGTGs traders are required to maintain positions within these limits. These positions are monitored during the day either manually and or through on line computer systems. In addition, these positions are reviewed by AIGTGs management. Reports which present each trading books position and the prior days profit and loss are reviewed by traders, head traders and AIGTGs senior management. Based upon these and other reports, AIGTGs senior management may determine to adjust AIGTGs risk profile. AIGTG attempts to secure reliable current market prices, such as published prices or third party quotes, to value its derivatives. Where such prices are not available, AIGTG uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. Historically, actual results have not materially deviated from these models. The methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates, commodity prices, volatility rates, market liquidity and other relevant factors. Unrealized gains and losses, with respect to AIGTGs positions are reflected in income currently. A significant portion of AIGTGs business is transacted in liquid markets. Certain of AIGTGs derivative product exposures are evaluated using simulation techniques which consider such factors as changes in currency and commodity prices, interest rates, volatility levels, market liquidity and the effect of time. AIGFP and AIGTG are both exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. AIG statistically measured the losses of fair value through the application of a VaR model. AIG separately calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG, as AIG manages these operations separately. AIGFPs and AIGTGs asset and liability portfolios for which the VaR analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments, derivative instruments and commodities. Because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale, at market is substantially hedged, segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. AIG uses the historical simulation methodology which entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. In this case, the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios. For each scenario, each transaction was re priced. Portfolio, business unit and finally AIG wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities. The final VaR number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95 percent confidence (i.e., only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the VaR figure).

The returns of the derivatives are linked to or "derived" from some underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or index. Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities, certain commodities, or financial or commodity indices. The more significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures and options. In the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counter party. The overwhelming majority of AIGs derivatives activities are conducted through AIGFP and AIGTG, thus permitting AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates, securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. AIGs customers such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. To help manage this risk, the credit departments of AIGFP and AIGTG operate within the guidelines set by the AIG Credit Risk Committee. This committee establishes the credit policy, sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account other factors, including the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIGs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary. AIGFP and AIGTG determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. If it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement, then one or more enhancement techniques will be used. Examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives and margin agreements. A significant majority of AIGFPs transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set off in the event of default. Also, under such agreements, in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity, AIGFP may be permitted to set off its receivables from that counterparty against AIGFPs payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. Excluding regulated exchange transactions, AIGTG, whenever possible, enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above. Discussions with respect to AIGFPs and AIGTGs counterpart credit quality, fair value source and notional amounts follow. 53 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Counterparty Credit Quality The following tables provide the counterparty credit quality amounts of AIGFPs and AIGTGs derivatives transactions at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of netting under ISDA Master Agreements and excluding collateral held. Subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate, currency and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments approximated $14.98 billion at December 31, 2002, including $1.9 billion of collateral held; and $10.84 billion at December 31, 2001. The net replacement value for futures and forward contracts approximated $110 million at December 31, 2002 and $64 million at December 31, 2001. AIGFP determines counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or, where such ratings are not available, by internal analysis. At December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, the concentration of credit exposure with respect to counterparties judged A or higher by AIGFP was 92 percent and 93 percent, respectively.

The net replacement values most closely represent the net credit risk to AIGTG or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss. Subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all futures, forwards, swaptions and purchased options contracts and interest rate and currency swaps was $2.29 billion and $3.05 billion at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. 54 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIGTGS NET REPLACEMENT VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001 WAS AS FOLLOWS: (in millions) REMAINING LIFE TWO THROUGH SIX THROUGH AFTER TOTAL Total ONE YEAR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS TEN YEARS 2002 2001 Credit exposure: Futures, forwards, swaptions and purchased options contracts and interest rate and currency swaps: Gross replacement value $ 5,678 $ 2,861 $ 2,735 $ 46 $ 11,320 $ 10,074 Master netting arrangements (3,895) (2,286) (2,563) (32) (8,776) (6,691) Collateral (85) (96) (63) (8) (252) (330) Net replacement value* $ 1,698 $ 479 $ 109 $ 6 $ 2,292 $ 3,053 * The net replacement values with respect to exchange traded futures and options, forward contracts and purchased over the counter options are presented as a component of trading assets in the accompanying balance sheet.

Fair Value Source The fair value sources of the net replacement values of AIGFPs derivatives portfolio were based on valuation models. Although these models are proprietary, the inputs were obtained from independently published exchange prices, external subscription services prices such as Bloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in these models. In the minimal instances when such prices are not available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. 55 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE FAIR VALUE SOURCE OF THE NET REPLACEMENT VALUE OF AIGTGS DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO WAS AS FOLLOWS: (in millions) MATURITY OF FAIR VALUE OF CONTRACTS TWO THROUGH SIX THROUGH AFTER TOTAL TOTAL SOURCE OF FAIR VALUE ONE YEAR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS TEN YEARS 2002 2001 Prices actively quoted $1,698 $ $ $ $1,698 $2,412 Prices provided by other external sources 357 357 530 Prices based on models and other valuation methods 122 109 6 237 111 Total $1,698 $ 479 $ 109 $ 6 $2,292 $3,053 Notional Amounts The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGFPs and AIGTGs involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGFPs and AIGTGs swaps business. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to AIGFPs and AIGTGs foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements.

AIGFP enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary course of its business. The overwhelming majority of AIGFPs credit derivatives require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. AIGFP provides such credit protection only on a "second loss" basis, under which AIGFPs payment obligations arise only after credit losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold amount or level of "first losses." The threshold amount of credit losses that must be realized before AIGFP has any payment obligation is negotiated by AIGFP for each transaction to provide that the likelihood of any payment obligation by AIGFP under each transaction is remote, even in severe recessionary market scenarios. In many cases, the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk, which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies. Typically, there will be an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio, and then successive layers that are rated, generally a BBB rated layer, an A rated layer, an AA rated layer and an AAA rated layer. In transactions that are rated, the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior to the threshold level above which AIGFPs payment obligation would arise is rated AAA by the rating agencies. For that reason, the risk layer assumed by AIGFP with respect to the designated portfolio in these transactions is often called the "super senior" risk layer, defined as the layer of credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been rated AAA by the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is not rated, equivalent thereto. For example, in a transaction with an equity layer covering credit losses from 0 to 2 percent of the total portfolio, a BBB rated layer covering credit losses from 2 to 4 percent, an A rated layer from 4 to 6 percent, an AA rated layer from 6 to 8 percent and an AAA rated layer from 8 to 11 percent, AIGFP would cover credit losses arising in respect of the portfolio that exceed an 11 percent first loss threshold amount, and thereby bear risk that is senior to the 8 to 11 percent AAA rated risk layer. 56 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIGFP continually monitors the underlying portfolios to determine whether the credit loss experience for any particular portfolio has caused the likelihood of AIGFP having a payment obligation under the transaction to be greater than super senior risk. AIGFP maintains the ability opportunistically to hedge specific securities in a portfolio thereby further limiting its exposure to loss and has hedged outstanding transactions in this manner on occasion. AIGFP has never had a payment obligation under these credit derivatives transactions. Furthermore, based on portfolio credit losses experienced to date under all outstanding transactions, no transaction has experienced credit losses in an amount that has made the likelihood of AIGFP having to make a payment, in AIGFPs view, to be greater than remote, even in severe recessionary market scenarios. At December 31, 2002 the notional amount with respect to AIGFPs credit derivative portfolio was $125.7 billion. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES THE CONTRACTUAL AND NOTIONAL AMOUNTS BY MATURITY AND TYPE OF DERIVATIVE OF AIGTGS DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001. (in millions) REMAINING LIFE TWO THROUGH SIX THROUGH AFTER TOTAL Total ONE YEAR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS TEN YEARS 2002 2001 Contractual amount of futures, forwards and options: Exchange traded futures and options $ 11,834 $ 1,451 $ 50 $ $ 13,335 $ 14,977 Over the counter forwards $168,572 $ 13,562 $ 1,977 $ 36 $184,147 $184,102 Over the counter purchased options $ 72,800 $ 17,657 $ 25,053 $ 252 $115,762 $138,655 Over the counter sold options (a) $ 69,247 $ 16,771 $ 25,255 $ 401 $111,674 $137,661 Notional amount (b) Interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements $ 16,440 $ 33,866 $ 4,613 $ 140 $ 55,059 $ 59,683 Currency swaps 2,351 5,866 327 8,544 11,092 Swaptions 3,608 5,789 1,118 10,515 7,280 Total $ 22,399 $ 45,521 $ 6,058 $ 140 $ 74,118 $ 78,055 (a) Sold options obligate AIGTG to buy or sell the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise. The amounts do not represent credit exposure. (b) Notional amount is not representative of either market risk or credit risk. In addition to its role as derivatives dealer through AIGFP and AIGTG, AIG and its subsidiaries, including its insurance subsidiaries, use derivatives primarily to minimize AIGs asset liability exposure and foreign currency and interest rate exposures. These transactions are generally executed with AIGFP and AIGTG as counterparty, who in turn hedge these transactions in the market place. Thus, AIGFP and AIGTG assume the credit risk exposure. AIG also uses derivatives to help match assets and liabilities in several of its businesses, including its insurance operations. For example, AIG can use currency and interest rate swaps to convert foreign currency investment contract liabilities into U.S. dollar based exposures. Thus, these liabilities are more properly matched with U.S. dollar assets. In life insurance, AIG uses swaps to reduce the mismatch between long dated life insurance liabilities and shorter dated local currency assets. Swaps also enable AIG to balance its asset and liability durations in consumer finance operations. AIGs Derivatives Review Committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction. The committee examines, among other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. This committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG for their own accounts. Generally, AIG conducts its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment. Thus, exchange gains or losses occur when AIGs foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar from one reporting period to the next. Legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability, through legal or judicial processes, of the obligations of AIGs clients and counterparties, including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations. (See also the discussion on master netting agreements above.) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141 "Business Combinations" (FAS 141). FAS 141 requires AIG to apply the purchase method of accounting for all acquisitions initiated after June 30, 2001. In June 2001, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (FAS 142). As of January 1, 2002, AIG adopted FAS 142. FAS 142 requires AIG to discontinue the amortization of goodwill in its consolidated income statement. Amortization 57 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) expense recorded in AIGs consolidated statement of income amounted to $163 million and $98 million pre tax for 2001 and 2000, respectively. FAS 142 requires goodwill to be subject to an assessment of impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred. The assessment of impairment involves a two step process prescribed in FAS 142, whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed, followed by a measurement of the amount of impairment, if any. FAS 142 also requires the completion of a transitional impairment test in the year of adoption, with any identified impairments recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. During the second quarter, AIG completed its transitional impairment test for 2002, resulting in no impairment. Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are primarily caused as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments. In November 2002, FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN45). FIN45 requires that, for guarantees within its scope that are issued or amended after December 31, 2002, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee be established, and recognized through earnings. FIN45 also requires additional disclosures in financial statements starting with AIGs 2002 year end financial statements. AIG believes that the impact of FIN45 on its results of operations and financial condition will not be significant. AIG guarantees the indebtedness of third parties principally in connection with AIG SunAmericas investments in affordable housing properties. The guarantees are issued primarily to facilitate financing for the construction of the underlying properties, and range in duration of up to ten years. The loans are secured by the underlying real estate. Since the inception of this investment program over ten years ago, payments under these guarantees have been insignificant. This is due to the fact that the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner, and secondly, are secured by the underlying properties. The maximum exposure under these guarantees as of December 31, 2002 is approximately $4.2 billion. In addition, AIGs real estate investment operations will occasionally extend guarantees to real estate partnerships in which they are an investor. The guarantees facilitate financing for the construction, and or purchase of land. There have been no payments to date under these guarantees. This is due to the fact that the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner, and secondly, are secured by the underlying properties. The maximum exposure under these guarantees as of December 31, 2002 is approximately $130 million. In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN46). FIN46 changes the method of determining whether certain entities should be consolidated in AIGs consolidated financial statements. An entity is subject to FIN46 and is called a variable interest entity (VIE) if it has (i) equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entitys operations, or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity. All other entities are evaluated for consolidation under existing guidance. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that has a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns of the VIE, or both. The provisions of FIN46 are to be applied immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and to VIEs in which AIG obtains an interest after that date. For VIEs in which AIG holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003, FIN46 applies to the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003. For any VIE that must be consolidated under FIN46 that was created before February 1, 2003, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the VIE would be initially measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. AIG is currently evaluating the impact of applying FIN46 to existing VIEs in which it has a variable interest, and believes that the impact on its results of operations and financial condition will not be significant.
