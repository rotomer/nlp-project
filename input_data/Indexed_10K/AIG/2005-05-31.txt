ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful. Gross premiums written, statutory underwriting profit (loss) and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with AIGs insurance competitors. AIG has also incorporated into this discussion a number of cross references to additional information included throughout this Form 10 K to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject. INDEX TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide the reader a narrative with respect to AIGs operations, financial condition and liquidity and certain other significant matters.

These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only AIGs belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside AIGs control. These statements may address, among other things, the status and potential future outcome of the current regulatory and civil proceedings against AIG and their potential effect on AIGs businesses, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, the effect of the credit rating downgrades on AIGs businesses and competitive position, the effect of the severing of ties between AIG and Starr and SICO, AIGs strategy for growth, product development, market position, financial results and reserves. It is possible that AIGs actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause AIGs actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those in the specific forward looking statements are discussed under Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business in Item 1 of Part I and throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligations) to update or alter any forward looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 30 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements Subpoenas. In February 2005, AIG received subpoenas from the Office of the Attorney General for the State of New York (NYAG) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to investigations into the use of non traditional insurance products and certain assumed reinsurance transactions and AIGs accounting for such transactions. The United States Department of Justice and various state regulators are also investigating related issues. During these investigations, in March 2005, AIGs then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer retired. In addition, AIGs then Chief Financial Officer was terminated for failure to cooperate in the investigations. Subsequently, certain other AIG executives, including its former comptroller, were terminated for similar reasons. On May 26, 2005, the NYAG and the New York Superintendent of Insurance filed a civil complaint against AIG relating to these investigations. For more information on these investigations, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Internal Review. In connection with the preparation of AIGs consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, AIGs current management initiated an internal review of AIGs books and records, which was substantially expanded in mid March. The internal review, conducted under the direction of current senior management with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, spanned AIGs major business units globally, and included a review of information and a number of transactions from 2000 to the present. In certain cases, items in periods prior to 2000 were examined due to the nature of the transactions under review. The business units subject to review were Domestic General Insurance, Foreign General Insurance, Reinsurance, Financial Services, Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services and Asset Management. The internal review encompassed AIGs books and records, thousands of files and e mails and interviews with current and former employees and members of management. Management believes that the scope and process of its internal review was sufficient to identify issues of a material nature that could affect AIGs financial statements. AIGs internal review was complemented by investigations by outside counsel for AIG and for the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm (PwC or independent auditors), was consulted on the scope of the internal review for certain matters and reviewed the results of the internal review. As a result of the findings of the internal review, together with the results of investigations conducted by outside counsel at the request of AIGs Audit Committee and in consultation with AIGs independent auditors, AIG has concluded that the accounting for certain transactions and certain relationships needs to be restated or adjusted. Restatement. AIG has restated its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004 and 2003 and the quarter ended December 31, 2003. AIGs previously issued financial statements for these and prior periods should no longer be relied upon. See Selected Financial Data and Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements for a reconciliation of previously reported amounts to the restated amounts. As part of its internal review, AIG evaluated the financial reporting consolidation process and the resulting financial statements as well as the appropriateness of AIGs prior accounting and reporting decisions. Based on this evaluation, the restatement includes corrections of errors in current or prior accounting periods for improper or inappropriate transactions or entries identified by the review. In many cases these transactions or entries appear to have had the purpose of achieving an accounting result that would enhance measures believed to be important to the financial community and may have involved documentation that did not accurately reflect the true nature of the arrangements. In certain instances, these transactions or entries may also have involved misrepresentations to members of management, regulators and AIGs independent auditors. The restatement includes adjustments, some of which had been previously identified but considered not to be sufficiently material to require correction. In addition, AIG has determined that certain accounts should be adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2004 to reflect changes in estimates made in the fourth quarter of 2004. The aggregate effect of these changes in estimates resulted in an after tax charge of approximately $1.19 billion. See Fourth Quarter 2004 Changes in Estimates herein and Note 1(cc) of Notes to Financial Statements. Details of Accounting Adjustments included in the Restatement. The accounting adjustments relate primarily to the categories described below. Many of the adjustments that do not affect previously reported net income or consolidated shareholders equity do, however, change both the consolidated and business segment reporting of premiums, underwriting results, net investment income, realized capital gains and losses and operating income, as well as other items. Adjustments that affect reported net income and consolidated shareholders equity relate to both the timing and recognition of revenues and expenses and affect the comparison of period to period results. Following the description of each transaction, accounting entry or entity category is a summary of the principal consolidated FORM 10 K : 31 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) statement of income and balance sheet accounts affected by the adjustments relating to that category. Risk Transfer. To recognize the cash flows under an insurance contract as premium and losses, GAAP requires the transfer of risk. If risk transfer requirements are not met, an insurance contract is accounted for as a deposit, resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as deposit assets or liabilities and not as revenues or expense. AIG has concluded, based upon its internal review, that there was insufficient risk transfer to qualify for insurance accounting for certain transactions where AIG subsidiaries either wrote direct insurance or assumed or ceded reinsurance. These transactions are now recorded using deposit accounting. The changes resulting from the change to deposit accounting affect both the consolidated balance sheet and statement of income. Detailed discussions of the principal accounts affected are provided below for each of the categories included. Union Excess: AIG has concluded, based on documents and information identified during the course of the internal review, that reinsurance ceded to Union Excess Reinsurance Company, Ltd., a Barbados domiciled reinsurer (Union Excess), did not result in risk transfer because of AIGs control over certain transactions undertaken directly or indirectly with Union Excess, including the timing and nature of certain commutations. Eliminating the cessions reduces reinsurance assets, effectively eliminates the inherent discount related to the loss reserves ceded under the contracts, and increases net premiums and losses. It should be noted that any income earned on the deposit assets in future periods would increase net investment income in those periods. In addition, as a result of certain facts and circumstances related to the formation of Union Excess, as well as certain relationships with Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO), Union Excess is now included in AIGs consolidated financial statements. The facts and circumstances surrounding SICOs involvement with Union Excess were not properly reflected in AIGs books and records, were not known to all relevant AIG financial reporting personnel and, AIG now believes, were not known to AIGs independent auditors. For example, a significant portion of the ownership interests of Union Excess shareholders are protected against loss under financial arrangements with SICO. Additionally, from its formation in 1991, Union Excess has reinsured risks emanating primarily or solely from AIG subsidiaries, both directly and indirectly. Further, it appears that the employees responsible for the reinsurance related to Union Excess managed that relationship to prevent significant losses or gains to Union Excess so that substantially all of the risks and rewards of the underlying reinsurance inured to AIG. This relationship allowed AIG to absorb substantially all the economic returns, which in turn caused Union Excess to be deemed a variable interest entity (VIE). The effect of the adjustments and restatement relating to Union Excess on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Premiums and other considerations $ 386 $ 439 $ 673 $ 726 $ 251 Net investment income 259 304 233 179 140 Realized capital gains (losses) (48 ) (17 ) 105 39 61 Incurred policy losses and benefits 671 433 683 638 955 Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses 48 48 52 111 63 Net income (78 ) 160 180 127 (368 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Premiums and insurance balances receivable, net of allowance 2,417 1,923 1,477 956 119 Reinsurance assets (5,511 ) (5,815 ) (5,856 ) (5,382 ) (4,763 ) Other assets 1,607 2,549 2,760 2,561 2,327 Total shareholders equity (951 ) (873 ) (1,033 ) (1,213 ) (1,340 ) Gen Re: In December 2000 and March 2001, an AIG subsidiary entered into an assumed reinsurance transaction with a subsidiary of General Re Corporation (Gen Re) involving two tranches of $250 million each. In connection with each tranche, consolidated net premiums written and consolidated incurred policy losses and benefits increased by $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 (with respect to the first tranche) and the first quarter of 2001 (with respect to the second tranche). The first tranche of the transaction was commuted in November 2004, reducing premiums and reserves for losses and loss expenses by approximately $250 million in the fourth quarter 2004. AIG has concluded that the transaction was done to accomplish a desired accounting result and did not entail sufficient qualifying risk transfer. As a result, AIG has determined that the transaction should not have been recorded as insurance. AIGs restated financial statements recharacterize the transaction as a deposit rather than as insurance. This adjustment also includes the effects of a related commutation in 2001. Such recharacterization had virtually no effect on net income or consolidated shareholders equity but had the 32 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries following effects on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Premiums and other considerations $ 245 $ $ $ (258 ) $ (250 ) Incurred policy losses and benefits 250 (258 ) (250 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Reserve for losses and loss expenses (250 ) (500 ) (500 ) (500 ) (250 ) Other liabilities 250 500 500 500 250 Other Risk Transfer: AIG has concluded that Richmond Insurance Company, Ltd., a Bermuda based reinsurance holding company (Richmond) in which AIG currently holds a 19.9 percent ownership interest, should be treated as a consolidated entity in AIGs financial statements due to AIGs ability to exert control over that entity. Such determination was based, in part, on arrangements and documents, including put agreements requiring an AIG subsidiary to purchase the Richmond shares, that appear not to have been previously disclosed to appropriate AIG financial personnel or AIGs independent auditors. Although AIG currently owns only a minority ownership interest in Richmond, a review of the operations of Richmond and its subsidiaries has shown significant previously undisclosed evidence of AIG control causing Richmond to be deemed a VIE. The consolidation of Richmond had virtually no effect on net income or consolidated shareholders equity. AIG has received notice of exercise of a put with respect to 49.9 percent of the Richmond shares and expects to acquire the shares by June 30, 2005. As a result of its internal review of AIG Re, AIG Risk Finance and AIG Risk Management and certain transactions, AIG determined that adjustments were required because certain transactions lacked sufficient risk transfer to qualify for insurance accounting under GAAP. The effect of the adjustments and restatement for Richmond, AIG Re, AIG Risk Finance, AIG Risk Management and certain other transactions on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Premiums and other considerations $ (287 ) $ 33 $ (856 ) $ (924 ) $ (815 ) Incurred policy losses and benefits (159 ) 53 (862 ) (561 ) (739 ) Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses (112 ) (62 ) (35 ) (242 ) (65 ) Net income (26 ) 22 (66 ) (4 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Premiums and insurance balances receivable, net of allowance (362 ) (389 ) (537 ) (752 ) (932 ) Reinsurance assets (529 ) (1,185 ) (912 ) (937 ) (1,032 ) Other assets 947 1,126 634 807 989 Reserve for losses and loss expenses (1,154 ) (1,609 ) (1,609 ) (995 ) (748 ) Reserve for unearned premiums 82 112 (31 ) (131 ) (347 ) Funds held by companies under reinsurance treaties (740 ) (1,019 ) (1,021 ) (1,103 ) (1,040 ) Other liabilities 1,910 2,114 1,850 1,392 1,120 Total shareholders equity (77 ) (51 ) (52 ) (73 ) (7 ) Loss Reserves: Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses is a complex process requiring the use of assumptions which may be highly uncertain at the time of estimation. As a result of its internal review, AIG has determined that the IBNR included in the General Insurance reserve for losses and loss expenses was adjusted on a regular basis without appropriate support for the changes requested to be made. Although AIG does not believe that any change materially affected the integrity of AIGs loss reserve position because in each instance IBNR as adjusted was determined to be within an appropriate tolerance of the applicable actuarial point estimate, AIG has determined that the unsupported decreases in reserves generated independently from the actuarial process constituted errors which should be corrected FORM 10 K : 33 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) and has restated the amounts of carried reserves accordingly. As a result, the fourth quarter 2002 charge relating to the increase in the General Insurance reserve for losses and loss expenses, previously reported as $2.8 billion, has been restated to $2.1 billion to reduce the original charge by the cumulative effect of the correction of the unsupported adjustments to reserves through that date (approximately $700 million). Therefore, the charge to pretax earnings is approximately $700 million less than previously reported, reflecting the removal of the unsupported adjustments to reserves in periods prior to and including the fourth quarter of 2002. The effect of the adjustments and restatement of the loss reserves on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is set forth as follows: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Incurred policy losses and benefits $ 302 $ 342 $ (351 ) $ 137 $ 223 Net income (196 ) (222 ) 228 (89 ) (145 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Reserve for losses and loss expenses 880 578 236 587 450 Total shareholders equity (572 ) (375 ) (153 ) (381 ) (292 ) Net Investment Income. As a result of the internal review, AIG determined that the accounting for certain transactions had the effect of improperly converting capital gains into net investment income and was not consistent with GAAP. The most significant of these transactions are: Covered Calls: From 2001 through 2003, certain AIG subsidiaries entered into a series of transactions with third parties whereby these subsidiaries sold in the money calls, principally on municipal bonds in their investment portfolios that had unrealized appreciation associated with them. Upon exercise of a call, the related bonds were delivered to the purchaser of the call and subsequently reacquired by the subsidiaries pursuant to contingent forward agreements which permitted the AIG subsidiaries to repurchase the bonds at the prevailing market value. In connection with selling the calls, the AIG subsidiaries also entered into interest rate swaps to protect them against the effects of changes in value of the applicable bonds as a result of movements in interest rates during the transaction period. These transactions were accounted for as sales and subsequent purchases and appear to have been initiated to increase net investment income. AIG has determined that, because AIG was able to cause the bonds to be returned from the third parties even after the third parties exercised the call options, AIG did not cede control over the bonds and therefore the transactions should not have been accounted for as sales and subsequent purchases but rather as financings. The adjustments required to correct this error reduce previously reported amounts of net investment income and correspondingly increase realized capital gains from these transactions over the three year period. The adjustments and restatement had no net effect on consolidated shareholders equity for any period and the following effects on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income accounts: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Net investment income $ 35 $ (179 ) $ (7 ) $ (146 ) $ Realized capital gains (losses) 57 118 61 55 Net income 59 (40 ) 35 (59 ) Synthetic Fuel Investment: AIG subsidiaries invest in certain limited liability companies that invest in synthetic fuel production facilities as a means of generating income tax credits. As a result of a misapplication of GAAP, AIG recorded net investment income or, in some cases, other revenues, on a pretax basis rather than reflecting the tax credit as a reduction of income tax expense, thereby increasing net investment income for AIGs life insurance and retirement services segment and other revenues for the financial services segment. Certain of these entries were previously identified but not corrected as the amounts were viewed as not sufficiently material to require correction. In the fourth quarter of 2004, AIG changed its accounting to present these tax credits as a component of income taxes. AIG has now determined that it is necessary to record these adjustments for the periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2004. These adjustments had no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders equity but had the following effects on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income accounts: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Net investment income $ (203 ) $ (238 ) $ (259 ) $ (31 ) $ Other revenues (143 ) (200 ) (165 ) (212 ) (79 ) Income taxes (346 ) (438 ) (424 ) (243 ) (79 ) 34 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Hedge Fund Accounting: AIG subsidiaries invest in a variety of alternative asset classes, including hedge fund limited partnerships, that are accounted for as available for sale securities. As part of the underlying partnership agreements, such AIG subsidiaries have the right to redeem their interests at defined times. A redemption allows AIG to record net investment income to the extent there are gains in the underlying funds at the time. However, as a result of its internal review, AIG has determined that, in certain cases, the redemption resulted in inappropriate gain recognition because the proceeds were required to be immediately reinvested in the funds. In addition, the cost bases of certain funds were misallocated in determining gains. The restated consolidated financial statements correct these errors. These corrections had virtually no effect on consolidated shareholders equity but had the following effects on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income accounts. Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Net investment income $ 11 $ 29 $ 159 $ (177 ) $ (101 ) Other revenues (9 ) 26 (27 ) (87 ) Net income 2 19 120 (133 ) (122 ) Muni Tender Option Bond Program: From 2000 through early 2003, AIG subsidiaries participated in a program in which they transferred highly rated municipal bonds at market value to a third party broker, which in turn transferred these securities to a trust that the broker had established. The trust then issued two sets of beneficial interests. Half of the beneficial interests were floating interest rate certificates. The remaining beneficial interests were inverse floating interest rate certificates. Third parties invested in the floating interest rate certificates, and AIG subsidiaries invested in the inverse floating interest rate certificates. AIG did not consolidate the trust into AIGs balance sheet. The AIG subsidiaries, as the holders of the residual interest inverse floating rate certificates, had the right to unilaterally liquidate the trust and cause the municipal bonds to be returned to AIG on short notice. Accordingly, the AIG subsidiaries did not cede control over the bonds. As a result, AIG now believes that the conclusion not to consolidate was an error in the application of GAAP. Therefore, AIG has now consolidated the trusts into its balance sheets at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. The consolidations had no effect on consolidated shareholders equity but had the following effects on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Net investment income $ 65 $ 60 $ 44 $ 11 $ Realized capital gains (losses) 27 (148 ) (47 ) (194 ) 22 Net income 60 (57 ) (2 ) (119 ) 14 Consolidated Balance Sheet: Other assets 2,075 2,199 1,449 Other liabilities 2,075 2,199 1,449 DBG/AIG Capital Corporation Intercompany Dividend: In 2002, AIG Capital Corporation issued shares of its preferred stock to National Union in exchange for shares of ILFCs common stock. AIG did not eliminate the preferred stock investment in consolidation, instead recording the dividend as income in net investment income and as corresponding expense in other operating expenses. AIG has now determined that this accounting is a misapplication of GAAP. Accordingly, AIG has eliminated this intercompany investment and reversed the accounting entries in its consolidated statement of income. The adjustments and restatement had no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders equity but had the following effects on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income accounts: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Net investment income $ (100 ) $ (100 ) $ $ $ Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses (100 ) (100 ) Top Level Adjustments and Other Directed Entries (other than loss reserves). Certain accounting entries originated at the parent company level had the effect of reclassifying realized capital gains to net investment income, as well as adjusting other line item reclassifications and other segment financial information. In some cases, expense deferrals were increased or reserves decreased, both having the effect of increasing reported earnings. In other FORM 10 K : 35 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) cases, the adjustments affected revenue and expense recognition between reporting periods or among business segments. Certain of these entries were previously identified but considered not to be sufficiently material to require correction. As part of its internal review, AIG analyzed and assessed top level adjustments since 2000 and determined that certain entries appear to have been made at the direction of certain former members of senior management without appropriate documentation or support. Foreign Life Insurance Net Investment Income Reclassification: In addition to the matters described above, certain accounting entries, now determined to be errors, had the effect of reclassifying capital gains realized from investments made to match liabilities relating to policies in Japan and Southeast Asia. Due to the limited availability of long duration bonds or bonds with sufficient yield to meet the policyholder liability requirements in Japan and Southeast Asia, AIG subsidiaries made alternative investments, including investments in equities. Until the fourth quarter of 2003, a portion of the capital gains realized on these alternative investments, including substantial amounts related to the sale of fixed income securities, was reclassified to net investment income in the consolidated statement of income to match these revenues against the incurred policy benefit expense of the underlying policies. Amounts so reflected, which were previously identified but not corrected as they were viewed as immaterial, are treated as corrections of errors in the restated financial statements, and are as follows: $57 million, $448 million, $278 million, $129 million, and $87 million for 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Beginning in the first quarter of 2004, a process was implemented to identify only certain equity related gains in Southeast Asia and a limited amount of fixed income and equity gains in Japan and to segregate and treat such realized capital gains separately for segment reporting purposes only. The new process and limits were applied retroactively for 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000 as part of the restatement. The restatement reverses all such unsupported top level and other directed entries, including the Foreign Life Insurance Net Investment Income Reclassification, with the following effect on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Premiums and other considerations $ 130 $ 250 $ (199 ) $ (272 ) $ (184 ) Net investment income (384 ) (783 ) (733 ) (514 ) (155 ) Realized capital gains (losses) 108 559 374 223 126 Other revenues 267 89 92 70 80 Incurred policy losses and benefits 57 195 (337 ) (417 ) (97 ) Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses (229 ) (115 ) 47 272 95 Net income 213 26 (112 ) (241 ) (112 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Premiums and insurance balances receivable, net of allowance (15 ) (265 ) (456 ) (398 ) (306 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses (30 ) (306 ) (246 ) (95 ) Other liabilities 252 231 251 155 (10 ) Total shareholders equity (206 ) (401 ) (454 ) (342 ) (105 ) Conversion of Underwriting Losses to Capital Losses. This category includes transactions and entries that had the principal effect of improperly recharacterizing underwriting losses as capital losses. Although these errors have a minimal effect on consolidated shareholders equity at December 31, 2004, they have an effect on underwriting results in each year. This category also includes insurance and reinsurance transactions where AIGs accounting resulted in errors relating to the timing and classification of income recognition as well as errors relating to the timing of premium recognition. The most significant transactions in this category are the following: Capco: AIG has determined that a series of transactions with Capco Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (Capco), a Barbados domiciled reinsurer, involved an improper structure created to recharacterize underwriting losses relating to auto warranty business as capital losses. That structure, which appears to have not been properly disclosed to appropriate AIG personnel or its independent auditors, consisted primarily of arrangements between subsidiaries of AIG and Capco that require Capco to be treated as a consolidated entity in AIGs financial statements. The result of such consolidation is to reverse capital losses for the years 36 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries 2000 through 2003 and recognize a corresponding amount of underwriting losses in 2000. The Robert Plan: AIG has restated the accounting for surplus notes purchased as part of a litigation settlement in 2002 with The Robert Plan Corporation (The Robert Plan). Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the surplus notes were to be repaid through profits received from a managing general agency relationship with The Robert Plan. When AIG deemed that repayment under the surplus notes was unlikely, AIG recorded the impairment charge as realized capital losses rather than underwriting losses. AIG now believes that this accounting treatment was an error and has restated the impairment charges as underwriting losses. AIRCO Reinsurance: In each of 1999 and 2000, AIRCO entered into stop loss reinsurance agreements with Union Excess relating to accident and health business of Nan Shan. Concurrently with each reinsurance agreement, AIRCO entered into a swap agreement with Union Excess, under which the payments were linked to payments under the reinsurance agreement. The transaction had the effect of converting incurred policy losses into capital losses. AIG has determined that its prior accounting was a misapplication of GAAP and has reversed both the cessions under the reinsurance agreement and the corresponding swaps. The effect of these adjustments and restatement on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Premiums and other considerations $ $ $ (43 ) $ $ 1 Realized capital gains (losses) 116 19 48 66 58 Incurred policy losses and benefits 130 192 Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses (6 ) (2 ) 1 Net income 79 20 (65 ) 66 (133 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Collateral and guaranteed loans, net of allowance (116 ) (55 ) Short term investments, at cost (100 ) (120 ) (120 ) Other assets (5 ) (7 ) (22 ) (67 ) (133 ) Total shareholders equity (30 ) (109 ) (129 ) (64 ) (130 ) Asset Realization. As a result of the internal review, AIG concluded that adjustments should be made to the value of certain assets included in its consolidated balance sheet. The most significant of these items are: Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG) Issues: A review of allowances for doubtful accounts and other accruals recorded by certain DBG member companies has led AIG to conclude that the allowances related to certain premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables and other assets were not properly analyzed in prior periods and that appropriate allowances were not properly recorded in AIGs consolidated financial statements. Certain relevant information was known by certain members of senior management but, AIG now understands, not previously disclosed to the independent auditors. In addition, various accounts were not properly reconciled. AIGs restated financial statements reflect the recording of appropriate amounts for these reserves and allowances for doubtful accounts for the appropriate time period, resulting in an after tax reduction in consolidated shareholders equity at December 31, 1999 of $514 million. Because all of the reporting periods affected by these adjustments were prior to 2000, the restatement results in decreases in insurance acquisition and other operating expenses in 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000. The effect of the adjustments and restatement resulting from DBG issues on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses $ (52 ) $ (224 ) $ (23 ) $ (22 ) $ (27 ) Net income 34 146 15 13 17 Consolidated Balance Sheet: Premiums and insurance balances receivable, net of allowance (864 ) (918 ) (1,142 ) (1,166 ) (1,249 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses (509 ) (509 ) (509 ) (509 ) (509 ) Reserve for unearned premiums (81 ) (81 ) (81 ) (81 ) (107 ) Total shareholders equity (290 ) (324 ) (470 ) (484 ) (497 ) Other Than Temporary Declines: AIGs investment accounting policies require that an investment that has been identified as impaired should be written down in the period in which such impairment is determined, and recorded as a realized capital loss. AIG has determined that realized capital losses with respect to certain impaired investments were not recorded in the appropriate periods, and the restate FORM 10 K : 37 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) ment will thus affect the timing of previously reported realized capital losses. The adjustments and restatement resulting from other than temporary declines had only a minor effect on consolidated shareholders equity but affected certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income accounts as follows: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Realized capital gains (losses) $ 4 $ 463 $ 307 $ (209 ) $ (202 ) Net income 2 301 200 (136 ) (132 ) Other GAAP Corrections. As part of its internal review, AIG has considered the application of certain accounting principles to specific businesses and transactions, and has determined that certain misapplications of GAAP are errors that require restatement of its financial statements. These adjustments include the following: Accounting for Derivatives (FAS 133 Hedge Accounting): AIG and its subsidiaries, including AIGFP, engage in hedging activities for their own accounts, which AIG believes have been and remain economically effective. AIG and its subsidiaries enter into derivative contracts principally to hedge interest rate risk and foreign currency risk associated with their assets, liabilities and forecasted cash flows. Such derivative transactions include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forwards, which are generally executed through AIGFP. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133) requires that third party derivatives used for hedging must be specifically matched with the underlying exposures to an outside third party and documented contemporaneously to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The internal review determined that in many cases AIG did not meet these hedging requirements with respect to certain hedging transactions. See the discussion under Derivatives herein. AIG has historically reported the changes in the fair value of certain derivatives used for hedging activities through other comprehensive income in consolidated shareholders equity or in net income with a corresponding adjustment to the hedged item, depending on the nature of the hedging relationship. In order to comply with FAS 133, the restated consolidated financial statements include the changes in fair value for certain derivatives, previously recorded through other comprehensive income, in current period income and reverse the previous adjustments on certain assets and liabilities recorded in income in connection with hedge accounting. Because these activities did not qualify for hedge accounting, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities requires AIG to recognize the corresponding changes in fair value, including foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations, relating to available for sale investments through accumulated other comprehensive income. These restatement adjustments with respect to FAS 133 do not result in any changes in AIGs liquidity or its overall financial condition even though inter period volatility of earnings increases. 38 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIG is assessing the cost and benefits of modifying its hedging activities to obtain hedge accounting under the requirements of FAS 133. The adjustments and restatement to reflect appropriate GAAP accounting for these derivatives, which also included reclassifications between the accounts securities available for sale, at market value and securities purchased under agreements to resell, at contract value, had the following effects on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Realized capital gains (losses) $ (109 ) $ 104 $ (14 ) $ (36 ) $ Other revenues 524 (1,357 ) (503 ) (370 ) 1,265 Net income 252 (783 ) (323 ) (252 ) 822 Consolidated Balance Sheet: Financial services assets: Securities available for sale, at market value 8,021 8,328 9,263 6,264 (156 ) Securities purchased under agreements to resell, at contract value (7,325 ) (7,325 ) (7,825 ) (6,325 ) Financial services liabilities: Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, at contract value 2,061 1,003 197 (340 ) (216 ) Unrealized loss on swaps, options and forward transactions (2,199 ) (610 ) 394 1,566 333 Retained earnings (394 ) (646 ) 136 459 711 Accumulated other comprehensive income 1,412 1,439 1,424 121 (134 ) Total shareholders equity 1,018 792 1,561 581 577 Accounting for Deferred Taxes: AIG identified certain misapplications of GAAP in its provision for deferred income taxes as follows: For certain foreign subsidiaries for which AIG has plans to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings, AIG incorrectly provided U.S. deferred taxes on the unrealized appreciation associated with investment securities in accumulated other comprehensive income. For certain foreign subsidiaries for which AIG does not have plans for permanent reinvestment of undistributed earnings, U.S. deferred taxes were incorrectly omitted on certain components of other comprehensive income. These adjustments and restatement had the following effects on consolidated net income and shareholders equity: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Net income $ (5 ) $ (23 ) $ (22 ) $ $ Consolidated Balance Sheet: Total shareholders equity 889 761 490 324 166 Foreign Currency Translation (FAS 52): FAS 52 is used to determine the timing of the recognition of income or expense resulting from foreign exchange rate changes for transactions denominated in other than a functional currency. AIG has determined that, in certain cases, its application of FAS 52 in its consolidated financial statements did not comply with the functional currency determination requirements of the standard. As a result, AIG has recorded accounting adjustments to reclassify currency transaction gains and losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income. These corrections affected consolidated net income in certain periods but had no effect on consolidated shareholders equity at December 31, 2004 or for prior periods. AIG adopted a practice in the 1990s of recording adjustments to general insurance reserves to offset increases or decreases in such reserves through other comprehensive income, net of tax, resulting from translation of reserves denominated in foreign currencies. AIG now believes that this accounting practice was a misapplication of GAAP. As a result of this adjustment, general insurance reserves denominated in foreign currencies have been restated to restore the translation effect to reserve for losses and loss expenses. FORM 10 K : 39 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Together, these adjustments had the following effects on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Realized capital gains (losses) $ (127 ) $ (193 ) $ (52 ) $ 44 $ Net income (124 ) (193 ) (53 ) 75 119 Consolidated Balance Sheet: Other assets 163 143 31 (6 ) (15 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses (25 ) (407 ) (882 ) (902 ) (747 ) Total shareholders equity 131 358 594 583 476 Life Settlements. Life settlements are designed to assist life insurance policyholders to monetize the existing value of life insurance policies. AIG, through an insurance subsidiary and non consolidated trusts, which are deemed to be a qualifying special purpose entity and a VIE, engages in this business. The non consolidated trusts purchase life insurance policies from policyholders at an initial price and pay additional premiums to keep the policies in force until the insured dies. AIGs proportionate share of the net death benefits from the purchased contracts, net of reinsurance to a third party reinsurer, was recorded as premium. The costs incurred by the trusts to acquire the contracts and keep them in force were recorded as paid losses by AIG, net of reinsurance. AIGs accounting resulted in upfront gain recognition of expected profits and premium recognition for amounts loaned to the trusts by other AIG subsidiaries. AIG has determined, in light of new information which was not available to management or AIGs independent auditors at the time the initial accounting determination was made, that the accounting for these transactions as insurance and reinsurance is a misapplication of GAAP that should be corrected through restatement. This restatement results in life settlements being accounted for using an investment method of accounting under FASB Technical Bulletin (FTB) 85 4 Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance. Under FTB 85 4, the carrying value of each contract at purchase and at the end of each reporting period is equal to the cash surrender value of the contract. Cash paid to purchase these contracts that is in excess of the cash surrender value at the date of purchase is recognized as a loss immediately, and periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums necessary to keep the underlying contract in force, are charged to earnings immediately. The life insurance benefits at the insureds death are payable to the AIG subsidiary and reflected in income at that time. The effect of the adjustments and restatement on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows. Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Premiums and other considerations $ (915 ) $ (809 ) $ (603 ) $ (147 ) $ Net investment income (134 ) (143 ) (114 ) (20 ) Incurred policy losses and benefits (850 ) (743 ) (552 ) (134 ) Net income (129 ) (136 ) (107 ) (22 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Other invested assets (486 ) (253 ) (142 ) (28 ) Premiums and insurance balances receivable, net of allowance (3,075 ) (1,842 ) (774 ) Other assets 341 219 111 29 Reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses (1,734 ) (1,026 ) (527 ) (134 ) Funds held by companies under reinsurance treaties (1,242 ) (601 ) (193 ) Total shareholders equity (396 ) (270 ) (129 ) (22 ) Recently, the FASB tentatively concluded that life settlement contracts should be accounted for as an investment, held at cost, with no loss recognized at inception, and revenue recognized when the death benefit is received. In its discussions, the FASB tentatively concluded that retroactive application will be required. AIG expects that approximately $250 million of the restatement adjustment to shareholders equity at December 31, 2004 would be eliminated if the FASBs tentative conclusion is adopted. Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC): The internal review identified a misapplication of GAAP with respect to General Insurance DAC. As a result of top level entries, substantially all costs associated with underwriting and marketing operations were deferred. The internal review determined that certain of these costs did not vary sufficiently with the production of business and should not have been deferred. These costs have been allocated to the periods in which they were incurred and the corresponding DAC asset has been adjusted accordingly. In addition, AIG determined that the amortization period for certain DAC was longer than the typical life of the underlying policies and needed to be shortened, and that certain deferrals associated with an inter company reinsurance treaty were in error and required correction. This adjustment includes the recharacterization of certain incurred policy losses and benefits to Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses. The effect of 40 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries these adjustments on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Incurred policy losses and benefits $ (265 ) $ (231 ) $ (188 ) $ (133 ) $ (134 ) Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses 321 287 285 450 310 Net income (33 ) 2 (12 ) (138 ) (40 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Deferred policy acquisition costs (485 ) (432 ) (383 ) (307 ) (85 ) Other assets (92 ) (94 ) (146 ) (204 ) (214 ) Total shareholders equity (344 ) (311 ) (313 ) (301 ) (163 ) SICO Deferred Compensation: AIG has included in this restatement, expense amounts attributable to deferred compensation granted to certain AIG employees by SICO (pursuant to the SICO Plan described under Item 11. Executive Compensation), a private holding company that owns approximately 12 percent of AIGs common stock. The amount of deferred compensation granted by SICO has previously been disclosed in the notes to AIGs consolidated financial statements but was not included as an expense in the calculation of AIGs consolidated net income because the amounts had been determined not to be material to AIGs consolidated results of operations in any individual period. The expense related to SICO deferred compensation is recorded as a charge to reported earnings in the periods restated, with an offsetting entry to additional paid in capital reflecting amounts deemed contributed by SICO. For prior periods, AIG has recorded a reduction of $905 million in retained earnings on its December 31, 1999 consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital. The volatility in the expense is attributable to the variable accounting as well as the fact that shares are allocated only in alternate years. The inclusion of the expense attributable to the SICO Plans in AIGs consolidated financial statements had no effect on consolidated shareholders equity but had the following effects on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income accounts: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses $ 56 $ 275 $ (173 ) $ 45 $ 293 Net income (56 ) (275 ) 173 (45 ) (293 ) Commutations: Certain direct insurance, and ceded and assumed reinsurance contracts, were commuted prior to their natural expiration. For certain commutations, the cash received was recorded through negative paid losses in accordance with statutory guidance, while for others it was recorded as written premiums. Despite the lack of guidance under GAAP with respect to this issue, AIG has determined that the accounting for certain commutations was in error due to the inconsistency in AIGs accounting for commutations and the fact that certain commutations were recorded through the written premium line when there was no unearned premium balance outstanding. As part of this restatement any commutations that were originally recorded through written premium are reclassified to paid losses in the period in which they occurred. The adjustments and restatement have no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders equity but affected certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts as follows: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Premiums and other considerations $ (370 ) $ (405 ) $ (79 ) $ 4 $ (312 ) Incurred policy losses and benefits (370 ) (405 ) (79 ) 4 (312 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Reserves for losses and loss expenses 151 58 51 51 Insurance balances payable (93 ) (51 ) (51 ) (51 ) Dollar Roll Transactions: Certain AIG subsidiaries entered into dollar roll transactions with third parties designed to enhance the return on AIGs mortgage backed securities (MBS) portfolio. In a dollar roll transaction, AIG subsidiaries agree to sell a pool of MBSs and simultaneously agree to repurchase substantially the same securities at a later date, typically in one month. AIG accounted for these transactions as collateralized financings under SFAS 140. Even though it had received collateral sufficient to fund substantially all of the cost of purchasing identical replacement securities at the time of transfer, AIG was not fully protected during the term of the contract to replace the asset in the event that the transferee defaulted. Accordingly, AIG should not have accounted for these transactions as financings, but rather as derivatives with mark to market changes reflected in earnings. The effect of the adjustments and re FORM 10 K : 41 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) statement on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income accounts is as follows: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Realized capital gains (losses) $ 16 $ (98 ) $ 157 $ (46 ) $ 26 Net income 16 (98 ) 157 (46 ) 26 Affordable Housing: Through an investment limited partnership, an AIG subsidiary, as the general partner, syndicates the tax benefits (including both tax credits and tax losses) generated by affordable housing real estate properties. AIG guarantees the return of the tax benefits to the limited partner investors. Prior to the second quarter of 2003, these syndication transactions were accounted for as sales and the gain was recorded on a straight line basis over ten years. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, because of the guarantees, AIG changed its accounting for these partnerships to record all new syndications as financings, rather than sales. At the same time, AIG adjusted its consolidated balance sheet to reflect previous syndications as financings, but did not record the cumulative impact to earnings because the amounts were viewed as immaterial. AIG has now determined that it is necessary to record these adjustments for the periods prior to the third quarter of 2003, and the adjustments and restatement had the following effects on certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Other revenues $ (39 ) $ (44 ) $ (43 ) $ (71 ) $ (126 ) Net income (25 ) (28 ) (28 ) (46 ) (82 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Other invested assets 1,452 1,652 1,585 1,427 1,172 Investment income due and accrued (289 ) (254 ) (222 ) (149 ) (109 ) Other assets (1,688 ) (2,009 ) (7 ) (5 ) (2 ) Other liabilities (30 ) (154 ) 1,770 1,644 1,360 Total shareholders equity (322 ) (297 ) (269 ) (241 ) (195 ) SunAmerica Partnerships: As part of the restatement, management has reclassified the earnings of the SunAmerica partnerships out of other operations, where previously reported, into the Asset Management segment. This revised presentation characterizes the partnership earnings as revenues rather than as a component of insurance acquisition and operating expenses in AIGs consolidated statement of income. Within the Asset Management segment, this presentation divides the partnership earnings into those of SunAmerica Life, whose equity supports the GIC business, and those of AIG SunAmerica, which are now classified as other asset management revenues. The adjustments and restatement have no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders equity but affected certain of AIGs consolidated statement of income accounts as follows: Increase (Decrease) For Years Ended and at December 31, (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Income: Other revenues $ 661 $ 323 $ 243 $ 475 $ 764 Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses 661 353 247 475 764 Fourth Quarter 2004 Changes in Estimates Adjustments affecting the 2004 consolidated statement of income include changes in estimates relating to the reserve for losses and loss expenses, certain expenses and certain allowances. See Critical Accounting Estimates herein. Losses and loss expenses incurred for the fourth quarter includes $850 million relating to changes in estimates attributable to asbestos and environmental exposures, see Asbestos and Environmental Reserve herein, $232 million relating to changes in estimates attributable to the accruals for salvage and subrogation recoveries (see Note 1(cc) of Notes to Financial Statements) and $178 million attributable to an arbitration decision with Superior National Insurance Company over the rescission of a quota share reinsurance agreement, which increases the reserves for the matter to $370 million at December 31, 2004. See Note 12(h) of Notes to Financial Statements. The changes in estimates also includes an adjustment of $56 million to deferred acquisition costs, principally relating to a refinement of costs eligible for deferral in accordance with AIG policy. The change in estimate for DBG asset realization includes an increase in the allowance for uncollectible receivables. With respect to income taxes, the change in estimate relates primarily from the determination that the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are expected to be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, AIG can no longer assert that the undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested. See Note 1(cc) of Notes to Financial Statements for further details on fourth quarter changes in estimates. 42 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table summarizes the more significant of the fourth quarter changes in estimates: For the Three Months and Twelve Months Ended (in millions) December 31, 2004 Fourth Quarter 2004 Changes in Estimates: Increase in reserve for asbestos and environmental losses and loss expenses $ (850 ) Deferred acquisition costs adjustments (56 ) Accrual for salvage and subrogation recoveries (232 ) Subsequent events related to reinsurance arbitration (178 ) DBG asset realization (150 ) Other changes in estimates (136 ) Total pretax changes in estimates (1,602 ) Income tax adjustments (146 ) Less: tax effect related to changes in estimates 561 Total changes in estimates $ (1,187 ) FORM 10 K : 43 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) The following tables summarize the effect on major balance sheet and statement of income accounts of the adjustments included in the restatement and the fourth quarter 2004 changes in estimates by transaction, accounting entry or entity category.

Operations and Business Results In 2003 and prior years, AIGs operations were conducted by its subsidiaries principally through four operating segments: General Insurance, Life Insurance, Financial Services and Retirement Services & Asset Management. Beginning with the first quarter of 2004, AIG reports Retirement Services results in the same segment as Life Insurance, reflecting the convergence of protective financial and retirement products and AIGs current management of these operations. All financial information herein gives effect to the restatement and adjustments for changes in estimates described in Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements and Fourth Quarter 2004 Changes in Estimates herein. Information for years prior to 2004 included herein has been reclassified to show AIGs results of operations and financial position on a comparable basis with the 2004 presentation. Through these segments, AIG provides insurance and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. This geographic, product and service diversification is one of AIGs major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors. The importance of this diversification was especially evident in 2004, when record catastrophe losses in certain insurance operations were more than offset by profitability in those operations as well as in other segments and product lines. Although regional economic downturns or political upheaval could negatively affect parts of AIGs operations, AIG believes that its diversification makes it unlikely that regional difficulties would have a material effect on its operating results, financial condition or liquidity. AIGs subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. In the United States, AIG companies are the largest underwriters of commercial and industrial insurance and one of the largest life insurance and retirement services operations as well. AIGs Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides asset management services and offers guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) to institutions and individuals. AIGs 2004 operating performance reflects implementation of various long term strategies and defined goals in its various operating segments. A primary goal of AIG in managing its General Insurance operations is to achieve an underwriting profit. To achieve this goal, AIG is disciplined in its risk selection and premiums must be adequate and terms and conditions appropriate to cover the risk accepted. AIG believes in strict control of expenses. Another central focus of AIG operations in current years is the development and expansion of new distribution channels. In 2004, AIG expanded its distribution channels in many Asian countries, which now include banks, credit card companies and television media home shopping. In late 2003, AIG entered into an agreement with PICC Property and Casualty Company, Limited (PICC), which will enable the marketing of accident and health products throughout China through PICCs branch networks and agency system. AIG participates in the underwriting results through a reinsurance agreement and also holds a 9.9 percent ownership interest in PICC. Other examples of new distribution channels used both domestically and overseas include banks, affinity groups, direct response and e commerce. AIG patiently builds relationships in markets around the world where it sees long term growth opportunities. For example, the fact that AIG has the only wholly owned foreign life insurance operations in eight cities in China is the result of relationships developed over nearly 30 years. AIGs more recent extensions of operations into India, Vietnam, Russia and other emerging markets reflect the same growth strategy. Moreover, AIG believes in investing in the economies and infrastructures of these countries and growing with them. When AIG companies enter a new jurisdiction, they typically offer both basic protection and savings products. As the economies evolve, AIGs products evolve with them, to more complex and investment oriented models. Growth for AIG may be generated both internally and through acquisitions which both fulfill strategic goals and offer adequate return on investment. In recent years, the acquisitions of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life have broadened AIGs penetration of the Japanese market through new distribution channels and will result in operating efficiencies as they are integrated into AIGs previously existing companies operating in Japan. AIG provides leadership on issues of concern to the global and local economies as well as the insurance and financial services industries. In recent years, efforts to reform the tort system and class action litigation procedures, legislation to deal with the asbestos problem and the renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act have been key issues, while in prior years trade legislation and Superfund had been issues of concern. FORM 10 K : 53 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) The following table summarizes AIGs revenues, income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 (in millions) 2004 (Restated) (Restated) Total revenues $ 97,987 $ 79,446 $ 66,460 Income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes 14,950 11,655 7,982 Net income $ 9,731 $ 8,009 $ 5,866 Consolidated Results The 23.3 percent growth in revenues in 2004 was primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned from global General Insurance operations as well as growth in both General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services net investment income and Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums. An additional factor was the decline in aggregate realized capital losses in 2004 compared to 2003. The decline in realized capital losses in 2004 reflects an improved economy, stronger corporate balance sheets and a significantly lower level of impairment loss provisions. The realized capital losses in 2003 reflect primarily impairment loss provisions. Upon the ultimate disposition of these holdings, a portion of these losses may be recovered depending on future market conditions. AIGs income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes increased 28.3 percent in 2004 when compared to 2003. Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management operating income gains, together with the decrease in realized capital losses, generated the increase over 2003 in both pretax income and net income. The following table summarizes the net effect of catastrophe losses for December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

General Insurance AIGs General Insurance operations provide property and casualty products and services throughout the world. General Insurance operating income includes catastrophe losses of $1.05 billion, $83 million and $61 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, General Insurance operations generated realized capital gains of $220 million in 2004 compared to realized capital losses of $62 million in 2003. General Insurance operating income in 2003 was substantially higher than 2002 due to the $2.1 billion reserve charge in 2002. 54 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Life Insurance & Retirement Services AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations provide insurance, financial and investment products throughout the world. Foreign operations provide over 60 percent of AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income. Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income increased by 24.7 percent in 2004. This increase resulted from growth in each of AIGs principal Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses, and the capital gains realized in 2004 rather than the capital losses realized in 2003. Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income also grew in 2003 relative to 2002 by 22.6 percent. Financial Services AIGs Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including aircraft leasing, capital market transactions, consumer finance and insurance premium financing. Financial Services operating income increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the fluctuation in earnings resulting from derivative activities that did not quality for hedge accounting under FAS 133. Offsetting this increase is the reduced income from Capital Markets operations and the effect of ILFCs disposition of approximately $2 billion in aircraft through securitizations in the third quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2004. Fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of Capital Markets operations and the effect of the FAS 133 adjustments. The charge relating to the PNC settlement, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, also had a significant negative effect on results. Consumer Finance operations increased revenues and operating income, both domestically and internationally. Asset Management AIGs Asset Management operations include institutional and retail asset management and broker dealer services and spread based investment business from the sale of GICs. These products and services are offered to individuals and institutions, both domestically and overseas. Asset Management operating income increased 66.0 percent in 2004 when compared to 2003 as a result of the upturn in worldwide financial markets and a strong global product portfolio; operating income also increased in 2003 when compared to 2002. Capital Resources At December 31, 2004, AIG had total consolidated shareholders equity of $80.61 billion and total borrowings of $95.26 billion. At that date, $85.28 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) or matched notes and bonds payable. During 2004, AIG repurchased in the open market 16,299,300 shares of its common stock. Liquidity At December 31, 2004, AIGs consolidated invested assets included $18.11 billion in cash and short term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2004 amounted to $35.58 billion. AIG believes that its liquid assets, cash provided by operations and access to short term funding through commercial paper and bank credit facilities will enable it to meet any anticipated cash requirements. Outlook From March through May of 2005, the major rating agencies downgraded AIGs ratings in a series of actions. S&P lowered the long term senior debt and counterparty ratings of AIG from AAA to AA+ and placed the ratings on Credit Watch Negative. Moodys lowered AIGs long term senior debt rating from Aaa to Aa2 and placed the ratings on review for possible downgrade. Fitch downgraded the long term senior debt ratings of AIG from AAA to AA and placed the ratings on Ratings Watch Negative. The agencies also took rating actions on AIGs insurance subsidiaries. S&P and Fitch lowered to AA+ the insurance financial strength ratings of most of AIGs insurance companies. Moodys lowered the insurance financial strength ratings generally to either Aa1 or Aa2. A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength ratings for most of AIGs insurance subsidiaries from A++ to A+ and the issuer credit ratings from aa+ to aa . The insurance companies ratings remain on a negative watch. In addition, S&P placed ILFCs AA long term senior debt rating and A 1+ short term rating on Credit Watch Negative. Moodys affirmed ILFCs long term and short term senior debt ratings (A1/P 1). Fitch downgraded ILFCs long term senior debt rating from AA to A+ and placed the rating on Rating Watch Negative and downgraded ILFCs short term debt rating from F1+ to F1. Fitch also placed the A+ long term senior debt ratings of American General Finance Corporation and American General Finance, Inc. on Rating Watch Negative. S&P and Moodys affirmed the long term and short term senior debt ratings of American General Finance Corporation at A+/A 1 and A1/P 1, respectively. These debt and financial strength ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, FORM 10 K : 55 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG managements request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries. For a discussion of the effect of these ratings downgrades on AIGs businesses, see Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business AIGs Credit Ratings in Item 1. Business. Despite industry price erosion in some classes of general insurance, AIG expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new General Insurance businesses as a result of AIGs broad product line and extensive distribution networks. AIG expects total General Insurance premiums to increase for 2005 and expects cash flow for investments to remain strong. Thus, General Insurance net investment income is expected to rise in future quarters even in a continued low interest rate environment. In China, AIG has wholly owned life insurance operations in eight cities. These operations should benefit from Chinas rapid rate of economic growth and growing middle class, a segment that is a prime market for life insurance. AIG believes that it may also have opportunities in the future to grow by entering the group insurance business. However, in March 2005 it withdrew its application to serve the group insurance market until certain regulatory issues are resolved. Among the regulatory issues to be addressed is the response to AIGs acknowledgment that certain of its Hong Kong based agents sold life insurance to customers on the Chinese mainland in contravention of applicable regulations. AIG Edison Life, acquired in August 2003, adds to the current agency force in Japan, and provides alternative distribution channels including banks, financial advisers, and corporate and government employee relationships. AIG Edison Lifes integration into AIGs existing Japanese operations will provide future operating efficiencies. In January 2005, AIG Star Life entered into an agreement with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, one of Japans largest banks, to market a multi currency fixed annuity. Through ALICO, AIG Star Life and AIG Edison, AIG has developed a leadership position in the distribution of annuities through banks. AIG is also a leader in the direct marketing of insurance products through sponsors and in the broad market. AIG also expects continued growth in India, Korea and Vietnam. Domestically, AIG anticipates continued operating growth in 2005 as distribution channels are expanded and new products are introduced. The home service operation has not met business objectives, although its cash flow has been strong, and domestic group life/health was also weak in 2004. AIG expects restructuring efforts in these businesses to show positive results by early 2006. AIG American Generals current ratings remain equal to or higher than many of its principal competitors. In addition, recent events have caused independent producers and distributors of AIG American Generals products to be more cautious in placing business with AIG. Therefore, AIG is unable to predict the effect of these issues on AIGs business, including any increase in associated surrender or replacement activity. In the airline industry, changes in market conditions are not immediately apparent in operating results. Lease rates have firmed considerably, as a result of strong demand spurred by the recovering global commercial aviation market, especially in Asia. Sales have begun to increase, and AIG expects an increasing level of interest from a variety of purchasers. Therefore, AIG believes that the improvements in that market which commenced in 2003 will be gradually reflected in ILFCs results in 2005. In the Capital Markets operations, the integration of AIG Trading Group Inc. and its subsidiaries into the operations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and its subsidiaries created operating efficiencies that will continue to be realized and product synergies that should enhance 2005 results, although quarter to quarter variations are to be expected in this transaction oriented business. AIG also expects increased contributions to Financial Services revenues and income from its consumer finance operations both domestically and overseas. However, the downgrades of AIGs credit ratings may adversely affect funding costs for AIG and its subsidiaries and AIGFPs ability to engage in derivative transactions and certain structured products. See Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business AIGs Credit Ratings in Item 1. Business. GICs, which are sold domestically and abroad to both institutions and individuals, are written on an opportunistic basis when market conditions are favorable. AIG expects to launch a matched investment program utilizing issuances of AIG debt securities, which will become AIGs principal spread based investment activity. However, in light of recent developments, the timing of the launch of this program is uncertain. Because AIGs credit spreads in the capital markets have widened following the ratings declines, there may be a reduction in the earnings on new business in AIGs spread based funding businesses. AIG has many promising growth initiatives underway around the world in its insurance and other operations. Cooperative agreements such as those with PICC and various banks in the U.S., Japan and Korea are expected to expand distribution networks for AIGs products and provide models for future growth. For a description of Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business see Item 1. Business. 56 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Critical Accounting Estimates AIG considers its most critical accounting estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses, future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts, deferred policy acquisition costs, estimated gross profits for investment oriented products, fair value determinations for certain Capital Markets assets and liabilities and other than temporary declines in value investments. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIGs results of operations would be directly affected. Throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIGs critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail. The major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below. Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses (General Insurance): Loss trend factors: used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on premium rate adequacy and the projected loss ratio with respect to prior accident years. Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year: in this case, accident year 2004 for the year end 2004 loss reserve analysis. For low frequency, high severity classes such as excess casualty and directors and officers liability (D&O), expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years. Loss development factors: used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate amount. Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Contracts (Life Insurance & Retirement Services): Interest rates: which vary by geographical region, year of issuance and products. Mortality, morbidity and surrender rates: based upon actual experience by geographical region modified to allow for variation in policy form. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (General Insurance): Recoverability and eligibility based upon the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Estimated Gross Profits (Life Insurance & Retirement Services): Estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated duration of the contracts (investment oriented products) affects the carrying value of deferred policy acquisition costs under FAS 97. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less required interest, actual mortality and other expenses. Fair Value Determinations of Certain Assets and Liabilities (Financial Services Capital Markets): Valuation models: utilizing factors, such as market liquidity and current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. AIG attempts to secure reliable and independent current market price data, such as published exchange rates from external subscription services such as Bloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model. When such prices are not available, AIG uses an internal methodology, which includes interpolation from verifiable prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of the transactions. Other Than Temporary Declines in Value Investments: Securities are considered a candidate for impairment based upon the following criteria: Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par, amortized cost (if lower) or cost for an extended period of time (nine months or longer). The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the debtor default, seeking bankruptcy or insolvency protection or voluntary reorganization. The possibility of non realization of a full recovery on its investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events. Operating Review General Insurance Operations AIGs General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance both domestically and abroad. See General Insurance Operations in Item 1. Business for more information relating to General Insurance subsidiaries. As previously noted, AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its investors. Accordingly, in its General Insurance business, AIG uses certain non GAAP measures, where AIG has determined these measurements to be useful and meaningful. A critical discipline of a successful general insurance business is the objective to produce operating income from underwriting exclusive of investment related income. When underwriting is not profitable, premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses and underwriting related expenses. In these situations, the addition of general insurance related investment income and realized capital gains may, however, FORM 10 K : 57 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) enable a general insurance business to produce operating income. For these reasons, AIG views underwriting profit to be critical in the overall evaluation of performance. Although in and of itself not a GAAP measurement, AIG believes that underwriting profit is a useful and meaningful disclosure. See also the discussion under Liquidity herein. Underwriting profit is measured in two ways: statutory underwriting profit and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) underwriting profit. Statutory underwriting profit is derived by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred. Statutory accounting generally requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for statutory purposes, expenses are recognized immediately, not over the same period that the revenues are earned. A basic premise of GAAP accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned, the accounting principle of matching. Therefore, to convert underwriting results to a GAAP basis, acquisition expenses are deferred (deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC)) and amortized over the period the related net premiums written are earned. Accordingly, the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by GAAP. DAC is reviewed for recoverability, and such review requires management judgment. See also Critical Accounting Estimates herein and Notes 1, 2 and 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. AIG, along with most General Insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses, respectively. The combined ratio presents the total cost per $100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized in income as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios. 58 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries General Insurance operating income is comprised of underwriting profit (loss), net investment income and realized capital gains and losses. These components, as well as net premiums written, net premiums earned and statutory ratios for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2003 2002 (in millions, except ratios) 2004 (Restated) (Restated) Net premiums written: Domestic General DBG $ 22,504 $ 19,563 $ 14,474 Transatlantic 3,749 3,341 2,500 Personal Lines 4,354 3,732 3,060 Mortgage Guaranty 607 531 508 Foreign General 9,393 7,855 6,168 Total $ 40,607 $ 35,022 $ 26,710 Net premiums earned: Domestic General DBG $ 21,202 $ 16,794 $ 12,333 Transatlantic 3,661 3,171 2,370 Personal Lines 4,291 3,678 2,791 Mortgage Guaranty 539 496 502 Foreign General 8,818 7,248 5,576 Total $ 38,511 $ 31,387 $ 23,572 Underwriting profit (loss)(a): Domestic General DBG $ (1,192 )(b) $ 504 $ (1,556 )(c) Transatlantic (47 ) 109 (57 )(c) Personal Lines 109 162 (148 )(d) Mortgage Guaranty 278 264 247 Foreign General(e) 703 (f) 1,035 497 Total $ (149 ) $ 2,074 $ (1,017 ) Net investment income: Domestic General DBG $ 1,927 $ 1,387 $ 1,452 Transatlantic 307 271 252 Personal Lines 193 158 184 Mortgage Guaranty 120 142 139 Intercompany adjustments and eliminations net 7 23 Foreign General 619 562 373 Total $ 3,166 $ 2,527 $ 2,423 Realized capital gains (losses) 220 (62 ) (368 ) Operating income(a) $ 3,237 (b) $ 4,539 $ 1,038 (c) Domestic General: Loss ratio 83.83 78.42 90.06 Expense ratio 18.94 16.91 18.98 Combined ratio 102.77 95.33 109.04 Foreign General: Loss ratio 61.70 55.59 60.83 Expense ratio(e) 29.08 27.70 30.03 Combined ratio(e) 90.78 83.29 90.86 Consolidated: Loss ratio(g) 78.76 73.14 83.15 Expense ratio 21.29 19.33 21.53 Combined ratio 100.05 92.47 104.68 (a) Catastrophe losses for 2004 by reporting unit were: DBG $582 million, Personal Lines $25 million, Transatlantic $215 million and Foreign General $232 million. Catastrophe losses for 2003 by reporting unit were: DBG $48 million, Personal Lines $5 million, Transatlantic $4 million and Foreign General $26 million. Catastrophe losses in 2002 by reporting unit were: DBG $20 million and Foreign General $41 million.

(f) Includes fourth quarter charge of $150 million attributable to the change in estimate for asbestos and environmental reserves. (g) The effect of the asbestos and environmental charge on the loss ratio was an increase of 2.21 in 2004. The effect of catastrophe losses on the loss ratio was an increase of 2.74 in 2004 and 0.26 in both 2003 and 2002. The effect of the loss reserve charge on the loss ratio was an increase of an additional 8.91 in 2002. General Insurance Results General Insurance operating income in 2004 showed positive results, even after accounting for catastrophe losses and the charge for asbestos and environmental exposures. Net investment income and the capital gains realized in 2004 rather than the capital losses realized in 2003 and 2002 also benefitted General Insurance results. Like most AIG units, DBG benefited in 2004 from the flight to quality, a strong profit center focus and growing distribution channels. Overall, DBGs net premiums written increased in 2004 and 2003. Domestic property casualty rates are generally satisfactory at this time, although in some classes of business, including property, D&O and energy, rates should be firmer. The underwriting loss in 2004 resulted from the fourth quarter charge attributable to the change in estimate for asbestos and environmental reserves and catastrophe losses. Lexington, the largest excess and surplus lines carrier and a major underwriter of property insurance, was also significantly affected by catastrophe losses. Transatlantics net premiums written and net premiums earned increased as a result of growth in its international business. However, Transatlantics results were substantially affected by record catastrophes in the U.S. and around the world. Net premiums written in personal lines operations for 2004 and 2003 include $359 million and $159 million, respectively, from the domestic insurance operations of GE that were acquired in August 2003. The increase in net premiums written apart from this acquisition resulted from increased marketing efforts as well as rate increases in several states. The underwriting profit in 2003 resulted from premium rate increases and growth in net premiums written and earned. Underwriting profits are expected to continue to improve in 2005 as a result of continued marketing efforts and loss cost stabilization. FORM 10 K : 59 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Net premiums written by Mortgage Guaranty operations increased 14.2 percent in 2004 over 2003. UGC achieved record premiums in 2004, excellent underwriting results that are substantially better than the overall mortgage guaranty insurance industry, and continued expansion of its international operations. Foreign General Insurance had excellent results in 2004, achieving a combined ratio of 90.78 even after sustaining $232 million in catastrophe losses. Growth in net premiums written was due to premium rate increases as well as new business and new distribution channels. Every major region of the worldwide network contributed to this performance. The Far East region had good results despite several typhoon losses. In Japan, corporate and personal accident business expanded. Commercial lines in Europe continue to exhibit strong growth, as did personal lines operations in Brazil and Latin America. Additionally, AIGs joint venture in India has expanded its commercial lines leadership among the private sector companies. AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of General Insurance net premiums written. 2004 Growth in original currency 13.8 % Foreign exchange effect 2.1 Growth as reported in U.S. dollars 15.9 % AIGs General Insurance results reflect the net effect on incurred losses from catastrophes of $1.05 billion, $83 million and $61 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The effect on losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to year, making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult. With respect to catastrophe losses, AIG believes that it has taken appropriate steps, such as careful exposure selection and obtaining reinsurance coverage, to reduce the effect of the magnitude of possible future losses. The occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity, such as a terrorist attack, earthquake or hurricane, that causes insured losses, however, could have a material adverse effect on AIGs results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. General Insurance net investment income grew in 2004 when compared to 2003. AIG is benefiting from strong cash flow as well as increased partnership income. In 2003, net investment income increased slightly when compared to 2002. As AIG believes that net premiums written will continue to increase in 2005, AIG expects that cash flow for investment will continue to be strong, resulting in growth in net investment income in 2005. See also the discussion under Liquidity herein and Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements. Realized capital gains and losses resulted from the ongoing investment management of the General Insurance portfolios within the overall objectives of the General Insurance operations. The realized capital gains in 2004 reflect an improved economy and stronger corporate balance sheets with significantly fewer impairments. Realized capital losses in 2003 and 2002 were reflective of weakness in the equity markets in early 2003 and prior periods and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings in all three years. See the discussion on Valuation of Invested Assets herein. The contribution of General Insurance operating income to AIGs consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes was 21.7 percent in 2004, compared to 38.9 percent in 2003 and 13.0 percent in 2002. The decrease in contribution percentage in 2004 was largely the result of the effects of catastrophe losses and the fourth quarter charge for asbestos and environmental exposures, while the increase of 2003 over 2002 reflected the $2.1 billion loss reserve charge in 2002. In 2002, AIGs General Insurance results reflect the net effect of the loss reserve charge of $2.1 billion with respect to accident years 1997 through 2001. Such charge was the result of AIGs annual year end review of General Insurance loss reserves. On a gross basis, incurred losses included $2.8 billion attributable to the loss reserve charge. Reinsurance AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its General Insurance operations. AIG insures risks globally, and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. Reinsurance is an important risk management tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention at prudent levels set by management. AIG also purchases reinsurance to mitigate its catastrophic exposure. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs because one or more catastrophe losses could negatively affect AIGs reinsurers and result in an inability of AIG to collect reinsurance recoverables. AIGs reinsurance department evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of state of the art industry recognized program models among other techniques. AIG supplements these models through continually monitoring the risk exposure of AIGs worldwide General Insurance operations and adjusting such models accordingly. While reinsurance arrangements 60 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries do not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds, an efficient and effective reinsurance program substantially limits AIGs exposure to potentially significant losses. AIGs consolidated general reinsurance assets amounted to $18.57 billion at December 31, 2004 and resulted from AIGs reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 2004 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 2004, approximately 43 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers. In order to obtain statutory recognition, the majority of these balances were collateralized. The remaining 57 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers. The terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories, not creditworthiness. Approximately 90 percent of the balances with respect to authorized reinsurers are from reinsurers rated A (excellent) or better, as rated by A.M. Best, or A (strong) or better, as rated by Standard & Poors. These ratings are measures of financial strength. AIG maintains a reserve for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance, but it has been largely successful in its previous recovery efforts. At December 31, 2004, AIG had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating $400 million. At that date, AIG had no significant reinsurance recoverables due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled (e.g., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction). AIGs Reinsurance Security Department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. Such assessments include, but are not limited to, identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity, and evaluating the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. This department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the requirements for credit risk mitigants. For example, in AIGs treaty reinsurance contracts, AIG includes provisions that frequently require a reinsurer to post collateral when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, AIG limits its unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers, which include, but are not limited to, insurer financial strength rating downgrades, policyholder surplus declines at or below a certain predetermined level or a certain predetermined level of a reinsurance recoverable being reached. In addition, AIGs Credit Risk Committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer. AIG enters into intercompany reinsurance transactions, primarily through AIRCO, for its General Insurance and Life Insurance operations. AIG enters into these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among AIGs various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. AIG generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain statutory recognition of these intercompany reinsurance transactions. At December 31, 2004, approximately $3.3 billion of letters of credit were outstanding to cover intercompany reinsurance transactions with AIRCO or other General Insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2004, the consolidated general reinsurance assets of $18.57 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of $819 million and $14.62 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses, including ceded losses incurred but not reported (IBNR) (ceded reserves). The ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments thereto are reflected in income currently. It is AIGs belief that the ceded reserves at December 31, 2004 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded. FORM 10 K : 61 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses The table below classifies as of December 31, 2004 the components of the General Insurance reserve for losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) with respect to major lines of business on a statutory basis*: (in millions) Other liability occurrence $ 16,223 Other liability claims made 10,358 Workers compensation 9,208 Auto liability 5,548 Property 4,098 International 3,490 Reinsurance 2,415 Medical malpractice 2,145 Aircraft 1,663 Products liability 1,384 Commercial multiple peril 1,137 Accident and health 1,090 Fidelity/ surety 960 Other 2,652 Total $ 62,371 * Presented pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR and loss expenses on a statutory accounting basis. At December 31, 2004, General Insurance net loss reserves increased $11.01 billion from the prior year end to $47.7 billion. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and the discount for future investment income. The table below classifies the components of the General Insurance net loss reserves by business unit as of December 31, 2004. (in millions) DBG(a) $ 32,849 Personal Lines(b) 2,310 Transatlantic 4,981 Mortgage Guaranty 352 Foreign General(c) 7,255 Total Net Loss Reserve $ 47,747 (a) DBG loss reserves include approximately $3.26 billion ($3.91 billion before discount) related to business written by DBG but ceded to AIRCO and reported in AIRCOs statutory filings. DBG loss reserves also include approximately $3.02 billion and $263 million related to business ceded to Union Excess and Richmond, respectively, and are now included in AIGs results as a result of insufficient risk transfer and the consolidation of these entities. (b) Personal Lines loss reserves include $668 million related to business ceded to DBG and reported in DBGs statutory filings. (c) Foreign General loss reserves include approximately $1.77 billion related to business reported in DBGs statutory filings. Foreign General loss reserves also include approximately $218 million and $19 million related to business ceded to Union Excess and Richmond, respectively, but now included in AIGs results as a result of insufficient risk transfer and the consolidation of these entities. The DBG net loss reserve of $32.85 billion is comprised principally of the business of AIG subsidiaries participating in the American Home/ National Union pool (11 companies) and the surplus lines pool (Lexington, Starr Excess Liability Insurance Company and Landmark Insurance Company). Beginning in 1998, DBG ceded a quota share percentage of its other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business to AIRCO. The quota share percentage ceded was 40 percent in 1998, 65 percent in 1999, 75 percent in 2000 and 2001, 50 percent in 2002 and 2003 and 40 percent in 2004 and covered all business written in these years for these lines by participants in the American Home/National Union pool. In 1998 the cession reflected only the other liability occurrence business, but in 1999 and subsequent years included products liability occurrence. AIRCOs loss reserves relating to these quota share cessions from DBG are recorded on a discounted basis. As of year end 2004, AIRCO carried a discount of approximately $651 million applicable to the $3.91 billion in undiscounted reserves it assumed from the American Home/National Union pool via this quota share cession. AIRCO also carries approximately $368 million in net loss reserves relating to Foreign General insurance business. These reserves are carried on an undiscounted basis. Beginning in 1997, the Personal Lines division ceded a percentage of all business written by the companies participating in the personal lines pool to the American Home/National Union pool. As noted above, the total reserves carried by participants in the American Home/National Union pool relating to this cession amounted to $668 million as of year end 2004. The companies participating in the American Home/ National Union pool have maintained a participation in the business written by AIU for decades. As of year end 2004, these AIU reserves carried by participants in the American Home/ National Union pool amounted to approximately $1.77 billion. The remaining Foreign General reserves are carried by AIUO, AIRCO, and other smaller AIG subsidiaries domiciled outside the United States. Statutory filings in the U.S. by AIG companies reflect all the business written by U.S. domiciled entities only, and therefore exclude business written by AIUO, AIRCO, and all other internationally domiciled subsidiaries. The total reserves carried at year end 2004 by AIUO and AIRCO were approximately $3.21 billion and $3.65 billion, respectively. AIRCOs $3.65 billion in total general insurance reserves consist of approximately $3.26 billion from business assumed from the American Home/National Union pool and an additional $368 million relating to Foreign General Insurance business. 62 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries At December 31, 2004, AIGs overall general insurance net loss reserves reflects a loss reserve discount of $1.55 billion, including tabular and non tabular calculations. The tabular workers compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979 81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non tabular workers compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities ranging from one to twenty years and the companys own payout pattern, with the future expected payment for each year using the interest rate associated with the corresponding Treasury security yield for that time period. The discount is comprised of the following: $399 million tabular discount for workers compensation in DBG; $503 million non tabular discount for workers compensation in DBG; and, $651 million non tabular discount for other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence in AIRCO. The total undiscounted workers compensation loss reserve carried by DBG is approximately $6.4 billion as of year end 2004. The other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business in AIRCO that is assumed from DBG is discounted using a 5.5 percent interest rate and the DBG payout pattern for this business. The undiscounted reserves assumed by AIRCO from DBG totaled approximately $3.91 billion at December 31, 2004. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently. It is managements belief that the General Insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all General Insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2004. While AIG annually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIGs ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially exceed AIGs loss reserves as of December 31, 2004. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIGs consolidated financial position, although it could have a material adverse effect on AIGs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. In a very broad sense, the General Insurance loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups. One group is long tail casualty lines of business which include excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers compensation, general liability, products liability, and related classes. The other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines, personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines. For operations writing short tail coverages, such as property coverages, the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes is geared toward maintaining an appropriate reserve level for the outstanding exposure, rather than determining an expected loss ratio for current business. For example, the IBNR reserve required for a class of property business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest years earned premiums, and this level of reserve would be maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in the current quarter. The 20 percent factor is adjusted to reflect changes in rate levels, loss reporting patterns, known exposures to large unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular class of business. Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. Experience in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses because a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. Therefore, IBNR would constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses. AIGs carried net long tail loss reserves are tested using loss trend factors that AIG considers most appropriate for each class of business. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions is normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximated five percent. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms; current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs recognized. A number of actuarial assumptions are made in the review of reserves for each line of business. For longer tail lines FORM 10 K : 63 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) of business, actuarial assumptions generally are made with respect to the following: Loss trend factors which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years. Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2004 for the year end 2004 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases, for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss trend (see above) and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors. For low frequency, high severity classes such as excess casualty and D&O, expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years. Loss development factors which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. AIG records quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of its many General Insurance profit centers. The overall change in AIGs loss reserves is based on the sum of these profit center level changes. For most profit centers which write longer tail classes of casualty coverage, the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes involves determining the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage. This loss ratio is multiplied by the current quarters net earned premium for that class of coverage to determine the quarters total estimated net incurred loss and loss expense. The change in loss reserves for the quarter for each class is thus the difference between the net incurred loss and loss expense, estimated as described above, and the net paid losses and loss expenses in the quarter. The process of determining the current loss ratio for each class or business segment begins in the profit centers in the latter part of the previous year. The loss ratios determined for each profit center are based on a variety of factors. These include, but are not limited to, the following considerations: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; actual and anticipated rate changes; actual and anticipated changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business; actual and anticipated changes in external factors affecting results, such as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment. Each profit centers loss ratio for the following year is subject to review by the profit centers management, by actuarial and accounting staffs, and ultimately by senior management. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios based thereon remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and changes in certain other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio for current business would be changed to reflect the revised assumptions. A comprehensive annual loss reserve review is conducted in the fourth quarter of each year for each AIG General Insurance subsidiary. These reviews are conducted in full detail for each class or line of business for each subsidiary, and thus consist of literally hundreds of individual analyses. The purpose of these reviews is to confirm the reasonableness of the reserves carried by each of the individual subsidiaries, and thereby of AIGs overall carried reserves. The reserve analysis for each business class is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business. In completing these detailed actuarial reserve analyses, the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions, including for example the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial method(s) to employ for each business class. Additionally, they must determine the appropriate segmentation of data or segments from which the adequacy of the reserves can be most accurately tested. In the course of these detailed reserve reviews for each business segment, a point estimate of the loss reserve is generally determined. The sum of these point estimates for each of the individual business classes for each subsidiary provides an overall actuarial point estimate of the loss reserve for that subsidiary. The overall actuarial point estimate is compared to the subsidiarys carried loss reserve. If the carried reserve can be supported by actuarial methods and assumptions which are also believed to be reasonable, then the carried reserve would generally be considered reasonable and no adjustment would be considered. The ultimate process by which the actual carried reserves are determined considers not only the actuarial point estimate but a myriad of other factors. Other crucial internal and external factors considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions in the United States and abroad, changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environments, underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions, and claims handling. Loss reserve development can also be affected by commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance agreements. With respect to the 2004 year end actuarial loss reserve analysis for DBG, the actuaries continued to utilize the modified assumptions which gave additional weight to actual loss development from the more recent years, as identified during the 2002 and 2003 analysis, with appropriate adjustments to account for the additional year of loss experience which emerged in 2004. Although the actuaries continued to use actuarial assumptions that rely on expected loss ratios based on the 64 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries results of prior accident years, the expected loss ratio assumptions used continue to give far greater weight to the more recent accident year experience than was the case in the prior year end assumptions. For example, for the excess casualty lead umbrella class of business, 100 percent weight was given to the experience of accident years 1998 2001, with no weight given to the more favorable experience of accident years prior to 1998. AIGs annual loss reserve review does not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates. Because a large portion of the loss reserves from AIGs General Insurance business relates to long tail casualty lines driven by severity rather than frequency of claims, such as excess casualty and D&O, developing a range around loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful. An estimate is calculated which AIGs actuaries believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve. This amount is then evaluated against actual carried reserves. There is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves, particularly for long tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty, when actual costs differ from the assumptions used to test the reserves. Such assumptions include those made for loss trend factors and loss development factors, as described earlier. Set forth below is a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the estimated effect on the loss reserve position of alternative loss trend or loss development factor assumptions as compared to those actually used to test the carried reserves. For the excess casualty class of business the assumed loss cost trend was five percent. Thus, in establishing the expected loss ratios for accident years 2002 through 2004, the loss costs from accident years 1998 through 2001 were trended by this five percent factor per annum. A five percent change in the assumed loss cost trend from each accident year to the next would cause approximately a $600 million change (either positively or negatively) to the net loss and loss expense reserve for this business. For the D&O and related management liability classes of business the assumed loss cost trend was four percent. Thus, in establishing the expected loss ratios for accident years 2002 through 2004, the loss costs from accident years 1997 through 2001 were trended by this four percent factor per annum. A five percent change in this assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a $500 million change (either positively or negatively) to the net loss and loss expense reserve for such business. For healthcare liability business, including hospitals and other healthcare exposures, a five percent change in the assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a $150 million change (either positively or negatively) to the loss and loss expense reserve for this business. Actual loss cost trends in the early 1990s were negative for these classes, whereas in the late 1990s loss costs trends ran well into the double digits for each of these three classes. The sharp increase in loss costs in the late 1990s was thus much greater than the five percent changes cited above, and caused significant increases in the overall loss reserve needs for these classes. While changes in the loss cost trend assumptions can have a significant effect on the reserve needs for other smaller classes of liability business, the potential effect of these changes on AIGs overall carried reserves would be much less than for the classes noted above. For the excess casualty class, if future loss development factors differed by five percent from those utilized in the year end 2004 loss reserve review, there would be approximately a $450 million change (either positively or negatively) to the overall AIG loss reserve position. The comparable effect on the D&O and related management liability classes would be approximately $200 million (either positive or negative) if future loss development factors differed by five percent from those utilized in the year end 2004 loss reserve review. For healthcare liability classes, the effect would be approximately $125 million (either positive or negative). For workers compensation reserves, the effect of a five percent deviation from the loss development factors utilized in the year end 2004 reserve reviews would be approximately $750 million (either positive or negative). Because loss development factors for this class have shown less volatility than higher severity classes such as excess casualty, however, actual changes in loss development factors are expected to be less than five percent. There is some degree of volatility in loss development patterns for other longer tail liability classes as well. However, the potential effect on AIGs reserves would be much less than for the classes cited above. The calculations of the effect of the five percent change in loss development factors are made by selecting the stage of accident year development where it is believed reasonable for such a deviation to occur. For example, for workers compensation, the $750 million amount is calculated by assuming that each of the most recent eight accident years develop five percent higher than estimated by the current loss development factors utilized in the reserve study, i.e. the factor 1.05 is multiplied by the incurred losses (including IBNR and loss expenses) for these accident years. AIG management believes that using a five percent change in the assumptions for loss cost trends and loss development factors provides a reasonable benchmark for a sensitivity analysis of the reserves of AIGs most significant lines of general insurance business. For excess casualty business, both the loss cost trend and the loss development factor assumptions are critical. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future loss development pat FORM 10 K : 65 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) terns will be the same as in the past. Moreover, as excess casualty is a long tail class of business, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in the loss cost trends or loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic phenomena affecting claims. For example, during the lengthy periods during which losses develop for excess casualty, actual changes in loss costs from one accident year to the next have ranged from negative values to double digit amounts. Thus, there is the potential for significant volatility in loss costs for excess casualty and, although five percent is considered a reasonable benchmark for sensitivity analysis for this business, there is the potential for variations far greater than this amount (either positive or negative). Likewise, in the judgment of AIGs actuaries, five percent is considered an appropriate benchmark for sensitivity analysis with respect to the loss development factor assumptions used to test the reserves. It should be noted that the loss cost trend factor for excess casualty was reduced to five percent in the year end 2004 loss reserve review compared to the 7.5 percent loss trend factor used in the 2003 review for excess casualty. This reduction was made by AIGs actuaries in response to a significant favorable loss trend that had emerged from accident year 2000 to 2001. This favorable trend appears to be continuing in accident years 2002 and 2003, although these accident years are still immature. For D&O and related management liability classes of business, the loss cost trend assumption is critical. The loss development factor assumption is important but less critical than for excess casualty. As this coverage is written on a claims made basis, claims for a given accident year are all reported within that year. Actual changes in loss costs from one accident year to the next in the 1990s ranged from double digit negative values for several accident years in the early 1990s to nearly 50 percent per year for the period from accident year 1996 to accident year 1999. Thus, there is the potential for extreme volatility in loss costs for this business and, although five percent is considered a reasonable benchmark for sensitivity analysis, there is the potential for variations far greater than this amount (either positive or negative). Five percent is also considered an appropriate benchmark for sensitivity analysis with respect to the loss development factor assumptions used to test the reserves for these classes. However, as noted above, the effect of such a deviation is less than that of a similar deviation in loss cost trends. It should be noted that the loss cost trend factor for D&O and related management liability classes was reduced to four percent in the year end 2004 loss reserve reviews compared to six percent in the 2003 review. This reduction was made by AIGs actuaries in response to a relative stabilization in loss costs from accident year 1999 to 2001 following the period of sharp increases in loss costs through 1999. The stabilization in loss costs appears to be continuing in accident years 2002 and 2003, although these accident years are still immature. For healthcare liability classes, both the loss cost trend and the loss development factor assumptions are critical. The nature of the potential volatility would be analogous to that described above for the excess casualty business. However, AIGs volume of business in the healthcare classes is much smaller than for excess casualty, hence the potential effect on AIGs overall reserves is smaller for these classes than for excess casualty. AIGs healthcare liability business includes both primary and excess exposures. For workers compensation, the loss development factor assumptions are important. Generally, AIGs actual historical workers compensation loss development would be expected to provide a reasonably accurate predictor of future loss development. A five percent sensitivity indicator for workers compensation would thus be considered to be toward the high end of potential deviations for this class of business. AIGs workers compensation reserves include a small portion relating to excess workers compensation coverage. The analysis applicable to excess casualty would apply to these reserves. However, the volume of such business is de minimis compared to the volume of excess casualty. The loss cost trend assumption for workers compensation is not believed to be material with respect to AIGs loss reserves other than for that portion representing excess workers compensation. This is primarily because AIGs actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident years reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for workers compensation business. For casualty business other than the classes noted above, there is generally some potential for deviation in both the loss cost trend and loss development factor selections. However, the effect of such deviations would not be material when compared to the effect cited above for excess casualty and D&O. The comprehensive annual loss reserve review process results in an accumulation of point estimates for AIGs General Insurance business. The loss reserve carried at year end 2004 for AIGs General Insurance business was approximately equal to the aggregate reserve indicated by the actuarial point estimates. This represents a relative improvement of approximately two percent from AIGs position as of December 31, 66 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries 2003. This comparison excludes the reserves relating to asbestos and environmental exposures, which are calculated using different methodologies, as described below. Asbestos and Environmental Reserves The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented. However, AIG currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and has excluded such claims from the analysis herein. The majority of AIGs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case basis. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a subjective process and reserves for asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated using conventional reserving techniques such as those that rely on historical accident year loss development factors. Significant factors which affect the trends that influence the asbestos and environmental claims estimation process are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving, and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposures for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties. Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as with other types of claims. Such future development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage issues. If the asbestos and environmental reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse effect on AIGs future results of operations. AIG does not discount asbestos and environmental reserves. With respect to known asbestos and environmental claims, AIG established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and environmental claims units, which investigate and adjust all such asbestos and environmental claims. These units evaluate these asbestos and environmental claims utilizing a claim by claim approach that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures. Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, AIG generally evaluates exposure on a policy by policy basis, considering a variety of factors such as known facts, current law, jurisdiction, policy language and other factors that are unique to each policy. Quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management judgment. Each claim is reviewed at least semi annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information. In both the specialized and dedicated asbestos and environmental claims units, AIG actively manages and pursues early settlement with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate its exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. AIG attempts to mitigate its known long tail environmental exposures by utilizing a combination of proactive claim handling techniques including policy buybacks, complete environmental releases, compromise settlements, and, where indicated, litigation. With respect to asbestos claims handling, AIGs specialized claims staff operates to mitigate losses through proactive handling, supervision and resolution of asbestos cases. Thus, while AIG has resolved all claims with respect to miners and major manufacturers (Tier One), its claims staff continues to operate under the same proactive philosophy to resolve claims involving accounts with products containing asbestos (Tier Two), products containing small amounts of asbestos, companies in the distribution process, and parties with re FORM 10 K : 67 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) mote, ill defined involvement in asbestos (Tiers Three and Four). Through its commitment to appropriate staffing, training, and management oversight of asbestos cases, AIG mitigates to the extent possible its exposure to these claims. In order to evaluate the overall reasonableness of the asbestos and environmental reserves established using the claim by claim approach as described above, AIG uses two methods, the market share method and the frequency/ severity or report year method. The market share method produces indicated asbestos and environmental reserve needs by applying the appropriate AIG market share to estimated potential industry ultimate loss and loss expenses based on the latest estimates from A.M. Best and Tillinghast. The market share method is a series of tests. Six estimates of potential industry ultimate losses for asbestos and environmental claims are tested. Additionally, a second series of tests are performed, using estimated industry unpaid losses, instead of industry ultimate losses. The market share tests are also performed using estimates of AIGs market share. The reason AIGs market share is an estimate is that there are assumptions as to which years and classes of business the asbestos and environmental exposure applies. For example, commercial multiple peril business is included in the market share calculation in some, but not all, of the scenarios. AIGs estimate of the carried net asbestos and environmental reserves were approximately $50 million greater than the mean indication of the outcomes of market share testing. However, the market share method does not give weight to AIGs actual asbestos and environmental loss experience. The frequency/severity or report year approach, is also a series of tests which are performed separately for asbestos and for environmental exposures. For asbestos, these tests project the expected losses to be reported over the next twenty years, i.e. from 2005 through 2024, based on the actual losses reported through 2004 and the expected future loss emergence for these claims. Three scenarios are tested, with a series of assumptions ranging from more optimistic to more conservative. In the first scenario, all carried asbestos case reserves, as determined above using the claim by claim approach, are assumed to be within ten percent of their ultimate settlement value. The second scenario relies on an actuarial projection of report year developments for asbestos claims reported from 1993 to the present to estimate case reserve adequacy as of year end 2004. The third scenario also relies on an actuarial projection of report year claims for asbestos, but reflects claims reported from 1989 to the present to estimate case reserve adequacy as of year end 2004. As of year end 2004, the results of the second and third scenarios varied significantly. In the second scenario, case reserves were indicated to be at slightly less than 60 percent of the ultimate settlement value at year end 2004, whereas in the third scenario they were indicated to be at less than 25 percent of ultimate settlement value. Based on the results of the prior report years for each of the three scenarios described above, the report year approach then projects forward to the year 2024 the expected future report year losses, based on AIGs estimate of reasonable loss trend assumptions. These calculations are performed on losses gross of reinsurance. The IBNR (including a provision for development of reported claims) on a net basis is based on applying a factor reflecting the expected ratio of net losses to gross losses for future loss emergence. For environmental claims, an analogous series of frequency/severity tests are produced. In general, the case reserve adequacy assumptions are narrower, as case reserve adequacy is indicated within approximately 25 percent of adequacy in all scenarios tested. Environmental claims from future report years (i.e. IBNR) are projected out ten years, i.e. through the year 2014. As of year end 2004, the range of outcomes from the scenarios tested for environmental ranged from $20 million below AIGs carried reserve to approximately $200 million greater than AIGs carried reserve. The range of outcomes for asbestos was greater. The indication from the first scenario, as described above, was approximately $140 million below AIGs carried reserve. The indication from the second scenario was approximately $10 million below AIGs carried reserves. The indication from the third scenario was approximately $650 million greater than AIGs carried reserve. At year end 2004, AIG considered a number of factors and recent experience to determine the appropriate reserve that should be carried for these claims, including the following: 1. Actual calendar experience for past ten years, five years, three years, and one year. AIG has experienced consistent adverse development on its carried asbestos and environmental reserves over the years. The net carried reserves from ten years ago have run off $1.45 billion deficient; from five years ago $430 million deficient; from three years ago $350 million deficient; and from one year ago $150 million deficient. Thus the reserves have consistently produced adverse development per year, with no evidence of recent improvement. These figures are prior to the year end 2004 reserve increase. 68 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries On a gross of reinsurance basis, the adverse developments have been analogous, with approximately $450 million in the latest year and $4.8 billion over the past ten years. 2. Input from claims officers on latest year events. DBGs claims officers have observed an increasing trend toward adverse claims experience in the layers underlying its excess attachment points for a number of Tier Two claims, increasing the probability of further adverse loss developments going forward. They also noted the emergence of several asbestos non products cases recently, raising a concern that asbestos non products cases could become a more serious problem in the future. 3. Deterioration in Report Year claims experience. As noted above, the Scenario Two and Scenario Three indications for case reserve adequacy in AIGs 2004 year end actuarial report indicated an increasing deficiency in carried case reserves for asbestos. This was the result of continued adverse development on prior year case reserves and suggests future loss development will be at higher levels than previously indicated. As a result, the Scenario Three indicated reserve deficiency increased from approximately $480 million in the 2003 year end reserve review to a deficiency of approximately $650 million in the year end 2004 review. Furthermore, the year end 2004 review utilized data evaluated as of June 30, 2004. An update to this data was recently produced (for all large claims) with claims evaluated as of March 31, 2005, i.e., an additional nine months of data beyond the year end 2004 reserve study. This update showed that report year losses in the nine months from June 2004 to March 2005 have produced additional adverse loss development. In fact, more loss development was observed during these nine months than for the twelve months from the June 2003 through June 2004 period. Thus, both the latest years data used in the year end 2004 actuarial study and the nine months of additional data subsequent to that study indicate the experience is deteriorating beyond what was expected at year end 2003. 4. Survival Ratios. AIGs year end 2004 survival ratio for asbestos was 5.7 and 5.2 on a gross and a net basis, respectively, prior to the year end 2004 reserve increase. AIGs year end 2004 survival ratio for environmental was 4.8 and 3.8 on a gross and a net basis, respectively, prior to the year end 2004 reserve increase. These survival ratios indicate AIGs carried reserves are sufficient to fund four to five years of payments for these claims, assuming payment levels remain stable. Based on the latest two years of actual paid losses, AIG does not expect its losses to decline as quickly as these ratios imply. 5. Industry experience. The industry has experienced a significant wave of adverse development for asbestos since 2001, with little, if any, signs of recent improvement. Furthermore, the litigation environment has become increasingly adverse. 6. Reinsurance Recoverable. Although AIG has been successful in collecting the vast majority of its reinsurance on asbestos and environmental claims, the greater the future losses and the longer the exposure persists, the greater the likelihood of increased problems in collecting reinsurance. Thus, the continued adverse developments and lack of any signs that loss experience is beginning to diminish increases the risk of uncollectible reinsurance. After considering all of these factors, particularly its recent experience, AIG determined that its carried reserve for asbestos and environmental claims would be best estimated by scenario three described above. This resulted in a $650 million increase in net asbestos reserves, and a $200 million increase in net environmental reserves. The corresponding increases in gross reserves were $1.2 billion for asbestos and $250 million for environmental reserves. Significant uncertainty remains as to AIGs ultimate liability relating to asbestos and environmental claims. This uncertainty is due to several factors including: The long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims; The increase in the volume of claims by currently unimpaired plaintiffs; Claims filed under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies; The number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection and the effect of prepackaged bankruptcies; Diverging legal interpretations; With respect to environmental claims, the difficulty in estimating the allocation of remediation cost among various parties; and The possibility of federal legislation that would address the asbestos and environmental issue. FORM 10 K : 69 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) A summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 follows: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos: Reserve for losses and loss expenses at beginning of year $ 1,235 $ 386 $ 1,304 $ 400 $ 1,114 $ 312 Losses and loss expenses incurred* 1,595 (a) 772 (a) 175 43 395 168 Losses and loss expenses paid* (271 ) (98 ) (244 ) (57 ) (205 ) (80 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses at end of year $ 2,559 $ 1,060 $ 1,235 $ 386 $ 1,304 $ 400 Environmental: Reserve for losses and loss expenses at beginning of year $ 789 $ 283 $ 832 $ 296 $ 1,115 $ 407 Losses and loss expenses incurred* 314 (b) 234 (b) 133 52 (140 ) (44 ) Losses and loss expenses paid* (129 ) (66 ) (176 ) (65 ) (143 ) (67 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses at end of year $ 974 $ 451 $ 789 $ 283 $ 832 $ 296 Combined: Reserve for losses and loss expenses at beginning of year $ 2,024 $ 669 $ 2,136 $ 696 $ 2,229 $ 719 Losses and loss expenses incurred* 1,909 (c) 1,006 (c) 308 95 255 124 Losses and loss expenses paid* (400 ) (164 ) (420 ) (122 ) (348 ) (147 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses at end of year $ 3,533 $ 1,511 $ 2,024 $ 669 $ 2,136 $ 696 * All amounts pertain to policies underwritten in prior years.

(c) Includes increases of $1.45 billion and $850 million for the fourth quarter relating to gross and net losses incurred, respectively, attributable to the change in estimate. The gross and net IBNR included in the reserve for losses and loss expenses, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined, at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, including the fourth quarter 2004 charge, were estimated as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos $ 2,033 $ 876 $ 695 $ 200 $ 709 $ 211 Environmental 606 284 347 80 313 72 Combined $ 2,639 $ 1,160 $ 1,042 $ 280 $ 1,022 $ 283 A summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Asbestos Environmental Combined Asbestos Environmental Combined Asbestos Environmental Combined Claims at beginning of year 7,474 8,852 16,326 7,085 8,995 16,080 6,672 9,364 16,036 Claims during year: Opened 909 2,592 3,501 669 2,106 2,775 959 1,657 2,616 Settled (100 ) (279 ) (379 ) (86 ) (244 ) (330 ) (154 ) (546 ) (700 ) Dismissed or otherwise resolved (708 ) (2,949 ) (3,657 ) (194 ) (2,005 ) (2,199 ) (392 ) (1,480 ) (1,872 ) Claims at end of year 7,575 8,216 15,791 7,474 8,852 16,326 7,085 8,995 16,080 The table below presents AIGs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for year end 2004, 2003 and 2002. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the year end carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio. 70 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIGs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment. These ratios for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: Gross Net 2004 Survival ratios: Asbestos 10.7 13.5 Environmental 6.5 6.8 Combined 9.1 10.5 2003 Survival ratios: Asbestos 4.7 4.5 Environmental 4.7 4.1 Combined 4.7 4.3 2002 Survival ratios: Asbestos 4.1 4.9 Environmental 5.4 5.3 Combined 4.5 5.1 Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries offer a wide range of insurance and retirement savings products both domestically and abroad. Insurance oriented products consist of individual and group life, payout annuities, endowment and accident and health policies. Retirement savings products consist generally of fixed and variable annuities. See also Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. Domestically, AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations offer a broad range of protection products, including life insurance, group life and health products, including disability income products and payout annuities, which include single premium immediate annuities, structured settlements and terminal funding annuities. Home service operations include an array of life insurance, accident and health, and annuity products sold through career agents. In addition, home service includes a small block of run off property and casualty coverage. Retirement services include group retirement products, individual fixed and variable annuities sold through banks, broker dealers and exclusive sales representatives, and annuity runoff operations which include previously acquired closed blocks and other fixed and variable annuities largely sold through distribution relationships that have been discontinued. Overseas, AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations include insurance and investment oriented products such as whole and term life investment linked, universal life and endowments, personal accident and health products, group products including pension, life and health, and fixed and variable annuities. Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations presented on a major product basis for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 2003(a) 2002(a) (in millions) (Restated) (Restated) GAAP Premiums: Domestic Life: Life insurance $ 1,881 $ 1,748 $ 1,604 Home service 812 834 854 Group life/health 1,128 1,046 967 Payout annuities(b) 1,484 1,272 1,044 Total 5,305 4,900 4,469 Domestic Retirement Services: Group retirement products 313 250 243 Individual fixed annuities 59 53 35 Individual variable annuities 408 331 333 Individual fixed annuities runoff(c) 80 86 93 Total 860 720 704 Total Domestic 6,165 5,620 5,173 Foreign Life: Life insurance 14,938 13,204 11,708 Personal accident & health 4,301 3,126 2,491 Group products(d) 2,215 1,267 1,094 Total 21,454 17,597 15,293 Foreign Retirement Services: Individual fixed annuities 395 255 216 Individual variable annuities 68 21 5 Total 463 276 221 Total Foreign 21,917 17,873 15,514 Total GAAP Premiums $ 28,082 $ 23,493 $ 20,687 Net investment income: Domestic Life: Life insurance $ 1,289 $ 1,183 $ 1,003 Home service 605 614 591 Group life/health 123 121 108 Payout annuities 801 699 615 Total 2,818 2,617 2,317 Domestic Retirement Services: Group retirement products 2,201 2,055 1,891 Individual fixed annuities 3,100 2,567 2,001 Individual variable annuities 239 239 174 Individual fixed annuities runoff(c) 1,076 1,266 1,416 Total 6,616 6,127 5,482 Total Domestic 9,434 8,744 7,799 Foreign Life: Life insurance 4,065 3,353 2,881 Personal accident & health 179 161 140 Group products 431 326 249 Intercompany adjustments (18 ) (15 ) (12 ) Total 4,657 3,825 3,258 2004 2003(a) 2002(a) (in millions) (Restated) (Restated) (continued) FORM 10 K : 71 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 2004 2003(a) 2002(a) (in millions) (Restated) (Restated) Foreign Retirement Services: Individual fixed annuities 1,034 368 240 Individual variable annuities 143 4 1 Total 1,177 372 241 Total Foreign 5,834 4,197 3,499 Total net investment income 15,268 12,941 11,298 Pricing net investment gains(e) 225 156 88 Realized capital gains (losses) (189 ) (337 ) (509 ) Total realized gains (losses)(e) 36 (181 ) (421 ) Total operating income $ 7,924 $ 6,353 $ 5,183 Life insurance inforce: Domestic $ 772,251 $ 645,606 $ 577,686 Foreign 1,085,843 937,425 (f) 720,906 Total $ 1,858,094 $ 1,583,031 $ 1,298,592 (a) Adjusted to conform to 2004 presentation.

They represent certain amounts of realized capital gains where gains are an inherent element in pricing certain life products in some foreign countries. (f) Approximately $124 billion relates to the acquisition of AIG Edison Life in August 2003. AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries report their operations through the following operating units: Domestic Life AIG American General, including American General Life Insurance Company (AG Life), USLIFE and AGLA; Domestic Retirement Services VALIC, AIG Annuity and AIG SunAmerica; Foreign Life ALICO, AIG Edison Life, AIG Star Life, AIA, Nan Shan and Philamlife. Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results The increase in operating income in 2004 compared to 2003 and 2003 compared to 2002 was caused in part by strong growth, particularly overseas, fewer capital losses realized in 2004 compared to 2003, and the decline in realized capital losses in 2003 compared to 2002. Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums grew in 2004 when compared with 2003. AIGs Domestic Life operations had record universal and term life sales and good performance from the independent distribution channels. Payout annuities also had strong growth. The domestic group business is below AIGs growth standards, largely because several accounts where pricing was unacceptable were not renewed and loss experience was higher than anticipated. Restructuring efforts in this business are focused on new product introductions, cross selling and other growth strategies. AGLA, the home service business, is diversifying product offerings, enhancing the capabilities and quality of the sales force, and broadening the markets served beyond those historically serviced in an effort to accelerate growth. The Domestic Retirement Services businesses most correlated to the equity markets performed well, with the strongest sales growth in the individual variable annuity segment. VALIC, the group retirement services business, also benefited from improved equity market performance and has had continued success cross selling individual variable annuities, fixed annuities and mutual funds. AIG Annuity, the individual fixed annuity business, showed growth in operating income. AIG expects to remain disciplined in pricing and return requirements even though rising short term interest rates and aggressive competitor pricing have created a more difficult environment. AIG SunAmerica Retirement Markets, the individual variable annuity business, reported record operating income and sales in 2004. Equity market gains, along with the strong increase in sales and net flows, resulted in a significant improvement in variable annuity fee income when compared to 2003. The decrease in fourth quarter sales followed declining equity markets in the third quarter and the first half of the fourth quarter. AIG is continuing to increase the size of the wholesaler organization as a measure to improve sales. The majority of the growth in Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums in Foreign Life operations was attributable to the life insurance, personal accident & health, and group products lines of business. Globally, AIGs deep and diverse distribution, which includes bancassurance, worksite marketing, direct marketing, and strong agency organizations, provides a powerful platform for growth. This growth was most significant in Southeast Asia where AIG maintains significant market share established by its strong agency force, and in Japan, where AIG has benefited from a flight to quality and development of multiple distribution channels. In light of AIGs recent credit rating downgrades, it is unclear whether this flight to quality will continue to benefit AIG. See Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business AIGs Credit Ratings, for a further discussion of the potential effect of the rating downgrades on AIGs businesses. Also in Japan, AIG Edison Life is being integrated successfully into AIGs life operations. AIG Star Life is growing first year premiums as a result of new product introductions and an expanded agency force, and is benefiting from more successful conservation of in force business. The Foreign Retirement Services business continues its 72 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries strong growth based upon its success in Japan and Korea by expanding its extensive distribution network and leveraging AIGs product expertise. AIG is introducing annuity products in new markets. In January 2005, AIG Star Life entered into an agreement with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, one of Japans largest banks, to market a multi currency fixed annuity. In China, where AIG has a 57 percent market share of the total 2004 premiums written by foreign life insurers, first year life insurance premiums increased 36.6 percent in 2004 over the prior year. In addition, AIG had very good results in Greece, Central Europe and Russia. Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations produced 78.0 percent, 76.1 percent and 75.0 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums. 2004 Growth in original currency 15.9 % Foreign exchange effect 3.6 Growth as reported in U.S. dollars 19.5 % Under U.S. GAAP, deposits and certain other considerations received under deferred annuity (variable and fixed) and universal life contracts are not included as GAAP premiums. If such amounts were to be included, the overall growth from 2004 over 2003 would be greater, due in part to large increases in foreign individual fixed annuities. The growth in net investment income in 2004 was attributable to both foreign and domestic invested new cash flow for investment. Additionally, net investment income was positively affected by the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. Lastly, AIGs adoption of Statement of Position 03 1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts (SOP 03 1), increased net investment income in 2004 over prior years. See also the discussion under Liquidity herein and Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolios are managed within the overall objectives of the Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations. The decline in realized capital losses in 2004 reflects an improved economy, stronger corporate balance sheets and a significantly lower level of impairments. The realized capital losses in 2003 reflect impairment loss provisions for certain equity and fixed income holdings. See also the discussion on Valuation of Invested Assets herein. The contribution of Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income to AIGs consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to 53.0 percent in 2004, compared to 54.5 percent in 2003 and 64.9 percent in 2002. The relative contribution percentage remained constant between years. The decrease in 2003 over 2002 was a result of the $2.1 billion loss reserve charge for General Insurance in 2002. Underwriting and Investment Risk The risks associated with the life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk. The risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is primarily investment risk. Underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses. The emergence of significant adverse experience would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves that could have a substantial effect on AIGs results of operations. AIGs Foreign Life companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on life insurance of a single life to approximately $1.7 million of coverage, and AIGs Domestic Life companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on life insurance of a single life to $5 million of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance. See the discussion under Liquidity herein and Note 6 of Notes to Financial Statements. AIRCO acts primarily as an internal reinsurance company for AIGs foreign life operations. This facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning locally (branch and subsidiary). It also allows AIG to pool its insurance risks and purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level and manage global counterparty risk and relationships. AIGs domestic Life Insurance and Retirement Services operations utilize internal and third party reinsurance relationships to manage insurance risks and to facilitate capital management strategies. Pools of highly rated third party reinsurers are utilized to manage net amounts at risk in excess of retention limits. AIGs domestic life insurance companies also cede excess, non economic reserves carried on a statutory basis only on certain term and universal life insurance policies and certain fixed annuities to AIG Life of Bermuda Ltd., a wholly owned Bermuda reinsurer. FORM 10 K : 73 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) AIG generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain statutory recognition of these intercompany reinsurance transactions. For this purpose, AIG entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated letter of credit facility in December 2004. Letters of credit totaling $2.17 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2004, and letters of credit for all $2.5 billion were outstanding as of March 31, 2005. The letter of credit facility has a ten year term, but the facility can be reduced or terminated by the lenders beginning after seven years. The investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets, primarily long term fixed rate investments, being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments. See also the discussion under Liquidity herein. To minimize its exposure to investment risk, AIG tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit. If a necessary rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims does not occur, a demand could be placed upon liquidity. See also the discussion under Liquidity herein. AIG actively manages the asset liability relationship in its foreign operations, as it has been doing throughout AIGs history, even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or certain local regulatory authorities may impose investment restrictions. For example, in Japan and several Southeast Asian countries, the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities. Therefore, there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities. Additionally, there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. To maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities, management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts while continuing to maintain satisfactory investment quality. Certain foreign jurisdictions, including Japan, have limited long dated bond markets, and AIG may use alternative investments, including equities, real estate and foreign currency denominated fixed income instruments to extend the effective duration and increase the yield of the investment portfolio to more closely match the requirements of the policyholder liabilities and DAC recoverability, particularly in Taiwan, where Nan Shan has approximately 30 percent of invested assets in foreign currencies. Using foreign currency denominated investments to support policyholder liabilities could increase the risk to and volatility of cash flows and income. AIG actively manages this risk through regular monitoring and selected hedging strategies. AIG actively manages the asset liability relationship in its domestic operations. This relationship is more easily managed through the ample supply of qualified long term investments. AIG uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies. As a part of these strategies, AIG may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes. In addition, the absence of long dated fixed income instruments in certain markets may preclude a matched asset liability position in those markets. A number of guaranteed benefits are offered on certain variable life and variable annuity products. See Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance for these benefits. DAC for life insurance and retirement services products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Policy acquisition costs which relate to universal life and investment type products, including variable and fixed annuities (investment oriented products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, as appropriate, in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. With respect to universal life and investment oriented products, AIGs policy, as appropriate, has been to adjust amortization assumptions for DAC when estimates of current or future gross profits to be realized from these contracts are revised. With respect to variable annuities sold domestically (representing the vast majority of AIGs variable annuity business), the assumption for the long term annual net growth rate of the equity markets used in the determination of DAC amortization is approximately ten percent. A methodology referred to as reversion to the mean is used to maintain this long term net growth rate assumption, while giving consideration to short term variations in equity markets. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less interest required as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses. Current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the effect on the amortization of 74 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries DAC. The estimation of projected gross profits requires significant management judgment. The elements with respect to the current and projected gross profits are reviewed and analyzed quarterly and are adjusted appropriately. AIGs variable annuity earnings will be affected by changes in market returns because separate account revenues, primarily composed of mortality and expense charges and asset management fees, are a function of asset values. DAC for both insurance oriented and investment oriented products as well as retirement services products are subject to review for recoverability, which involve estimating the future profitability of current business. This review also involves significant management judgment. If the actual emergence of future profitability were to be substantially different than that estimated, AIGs results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods. See also Note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. Insurance and Asset Management Invested Assets AIGs investment strategy is to invest primarily in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer, industry and or country concentrations. With respect to General Insurance, AIGs strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturity investments to maximize the yields at the date of purchase. With respect to Life Insurance & Retirement Services, AIGs strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities. See also the discussion under Operating Review Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations herein. AIG invests in equities for various reasons, including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk. Available for sale bonds and equity securities are subject to declines in fair value. Such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments, net of taxes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Generally, insurance regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance company may invest. When permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIG and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users.

In certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. FORM 10 K : 75 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) The following tables summarize the composition of AIGs insurance and asset management invested assets by segment, at December 31, 2004 and 2003: Life Insurance & Percent Distribution General Retirement Asset Percent (dollars in millions) Insurance Services Management Total of Total Domestic Foreign 2004 Fixed maturities: Available for sale, at market value $ 44,376 $ 259,602 $ 39,077 $ 343,055 68.4 % 61.2 % 38.8 % Held to maturity, at amortized cost 18,294 18,294 3.6 100.0 Trading securities, at market value 600 2,384 2,984 0.6 1.2 98.8 Equity securities: Common stocks, at market value 4,165 11,280 177 15,622 3.1 21.9 78.1 Preferred stocks, at market value 1,466 565 2,031 0.4 91.9 8.1 Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans 22 16,858 5,093 21,973 4.4 65.6 34.4 Short term investments, including time deposits, and cash 2,113 5,515 9,679 17,307 3.4 37.1 62.9 Real estate 592 3,007 326 3,925 0.8 22.8 77.2 Investment income due and accrued 1,023 4,041 461 5,525 1.1 57.5 42.5 Securities lending collateral 4,889 35,726 9,357 49,972 10.0 85.3 14.7 Other invested assets 5,604 7,154 8,316 21,074 4.2 86.8 13.2 Total $ 82,544 $ 344,348 $ 74,870 $ 501,762 100.0 % 63.7 % 36.3 % 2003 (Restated) Fixed maturities: Available for sale, at market value $ 41,610 $ 225,404 $ 32,453 $ 299,467 74.4 % 64.0 % 36.0 % Held to maturity, at amortized cost 8,037 8,037 2.0 100.0 Trading securities, at market value 282 282 0.1 100.0 Equity securities: Common stocks, at market value 3,759 3,649 60 7,468 1.9 44.0 56.0 Preferred stocks, at market value 1,371 525 1,896 0.5 91.7 8.3 Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans 25 15,546 5,228 20,799 5.2 68.5 31.5 Short term investments, including time deposits, and cash 1,912 4,662 2,343 8,917 2.2 53.1 46.9 Real estate 569 2,903 285 3,757 0.9 28.6 71.4 Investment income due and accrued 797 3,343 410 4,550 1.1 60.1 39.9 Securities lending collateral 5,225 20,537 4,433 30,195 7.5 76.0 24.0 Other invested assets 4,898 6,056 5,965 16,919 4.2 88.8 11.2 Total $ 68,203 $ 282,907 $ 51,177 $ 402,287 100.0 % 66.1 % 33.9 % Credit Quality At December 31, 2004, approximately 63 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities. Approximately 32 percent of such domestic securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately six percent were below investment grade or not rated. A significant portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio is rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors (S&P) or similar foreign services. Similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments, including mortgages. At December 31, 2004, approximately 20 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIGs internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately four percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. A large portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance. Any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date. Valuation of Invested Assets AIG has the ability to hold any fixed maturity security to its stated maturity, including those fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale. Therefore, the decision to sell any such fixed maturity security classified as available for sale reflects the judgment of AIGs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide, on a relative value basis, as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks. With respect to distressed securities, the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale. 76 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The valuation of invested assets involves obtaining a market value for each security. The source for the market value is generally from market exchanges or dealer quotations, with the exception of nontraded securities. If AIG chooses to hold a security, it evaluates the security for an impairment in valuation. As a matter of policy, the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of AIGs management and a continual review of its investments. In general, a security is considered a candidate for impairment if it meets any of the following criteria: Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par, amortized cost (if lower) or cost for an extended period of time (nine months or longer); The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in (i) the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; or (ii) the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims; or In the opinion of AIGs management, it is possible that AIG may not realize a full recovery on its investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events. Once a security has been identified as impaired, the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous market price and recorded as a charge to earnings. As a result of these policies, AIG recorded impairment losses net of taxes of approximately $369 million, $1.0 billion and $595 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The recovery in global equity and credit markets and reasonably steady domestic interest rates were the primary reasons for the decline in impairment loss recognition from 2003 to 2004. No impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIGs consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual impairment loss exceeded 0.7 percent of consolidated net income for 2004. Excluding the impairments noted above, the changes in market value for AIGs available for sale portfolio, which constitutes the vast majority of AIGs investments, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses, net of tax. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of AIGs fixed maturities and equity securities aggregated to $384.0 billion. At December 31, 2004, aggregate unrealized gains after taxes for fixed maturity and equity securities were $11.5 billion. At December 31, 2004, the aggregate unrealized losses after taxes of fixed maturity and equity securities were approximately $1.2 billion. The effect on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be further mitigated upon realization, because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, and realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain deferred policy acquisition costs. At December 31, 2004, unrealized losses for fixed maturity securities and equity securities did not reflect any significant industry concentrations. The amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2004, by contractual maturity, is shown below: (in millions) Amortized Cost Due in one year or less $ 1,637 Due after one year through five years 13,310 Due after five years through ten years 22,334 Due after ten years 28,824 Total $ 66,105 In the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the pretax realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were $1.8 billion. The aggregate fair value of securities sold was $31.7 billion, which was approximately 95 percent of amortized cost. The average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were trading continuously at a price below book value was approximately four months. FORM 10 K : 77 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) At December 31, 2004, aggregate pretax unrealized gains were $17.8 billion, while the pretax unrealized losses with respect to investment grade bonds, below investment grade bonds and equity securities were $1.3 billion, $284 million and $256 million, respectively. Aging of the pretax unrealized losses with respect to these securities, distributed as a percentage of cost relative to unrealized loss (the extent by which the market value is less than amortized cost or cost), including the number of respective items, was as follows: Less than or equal to Greater than 20% to Greater than 50% 20% of Cost(a) 50% of Cost(a) of Cost(a) Total Aging Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized (dollars in millions) Cost(a) Loss Items Cost(a) Loss Items Cost(a) Loss Items Cost(a) Loss(b) Items Investment grade bonds 0 6 months $ 29,918 $ 265 2,736 $ 11 $ 4 1 $ 2 $ 2 9 $ 29,931 $ 271 2,746 7 12 months 18,614 348 1,765 65 16 1 18,679 364 1,766 12 months 12,561 604 1,158 203 50 32 2 1 1 12,766 655 1,191 Total $ 61,093 $ 1,217 5,659 $ 279 $ 70 34 $ 4 $ 3 10 $ 61,376 $ 1,290 5,703 Below investment grade bonds 0 6 months $ 2,190 $ 58 249 $ 15 $ 4 11 $ 4 $ 3 20 $ 2,209 $ 65 280 7 12 months 1,058 47 174 15 5 7 9 6 14 1,082 58 195 12 months 1,220 101 217 204 51 63 14 9 4 1,438 161 284 Total $ 4,468 $ 206 640 $ 234 $ 60 81 $ 27 $ 18 38 $ 4,729 $ 284 759 Total bonds 0 6 months $ 32,108 $ 323 2,985 $ 26 $ 8 12 $ 6 $ 5 29 $ 32,140 $ 336 3,026 7 12 months 19,672 395 1,939 80 21 8 9 6 14 19,761 422 1,961 12 months 13,781 705 1,375 407 101 95 16 10 5 14,204 816 1,475 Total $ 65,561 $ 1,423 6,299 $ 513 $ 130 115 $ 31 $ 21 48 $ 66,105 $ 1,574 6,462 Equity securities 0 6 months $ 1,563 $ 78 570 $ 87 $ 25 54 $ 13 $ 13 48 $ 1,663 $ 116 672 7 12 months 446 38 223 311 93 80 15 9 42 772 140 345 12 months Total $ 2,009 $ 116 793 $ 398 $ 118 134 $ 28 $ 22 90 $ 2,435 $ 256 1,017 (a) For bonds, represents amortized cost. (b) As more fully described above, upon realization, certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, or realization will result in a current decrease in the amortization of certain deferred policy acquisition costs. As stated previously, the valuation for AIGs investment portfolio comes from market exchanges or dealer quotations, with the exception of nontraded securities. AIG considers nontraded securities to mean certain fixed income investments, certain structured securities, direct private equities, limited partnerships, and hedge funds. The aggregate carrying value of these securities at December 31, 2004 was approximately $65.0 billion, or approximately 13 percent of the portfolio. The methodology used to estimate fair value of nontraded fixed income investments is by reference to traded securities with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology. This technique takes into account such factors as the industry, the securitys rating and tenor, its coupon rate, its position in the capital structure of the issuer, and other relevant factors. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. For certain structured securities, the carrying value is based on an estimate of the securitys future cash flows pursuant to the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99 20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. The change in carrying value is recognized in income. Hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate less than a five percent interest are carried at fair value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. With respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest, AIG uses the equity method to record these investments. Changes in value are recorded in earnings. AIG obtains the fair value of its investments in limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the general partner or manager of each of these investments, the accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis. Each of these investment categories is regularly tested to determine if impairment in value exists. Various valuation techniques are used with respect to each category in this determination. 78 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Financial Services Operations AIGs Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft leasing, capital market transactions, and consumer and insurance premium financing. See also Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. Aircraft Finance AIGs Aircraft Finance operations represent the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for its own account, for airlines and for financial institutions. ILFC finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments. The composite borrowing rates at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 4.34 percent, 4.53 percent and 4.73 percent, respectively. See also the discussions under Capital Resources and Liquidity herein and Notes 3 and 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. ILFC is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through nonperformance of aircraft lessees, through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and, in part, through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease. ILFC manages its lessee nonperformance exposure through credit reviews and security deposit requirements. As a result of these measures and its own contingency planning, ILFC did not suffer any material losses from airline shutdowns in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, but there can be no assurance that ILFC will successfully manage the risks relating to the effect of possible future deterioration in the airline industry. Over 80 percent of ILFCs fleet is leased to non U.S. carriers, and this fleet, comprised of the most efficient aircraft in the airline industry, continues to be in high demand from such carriers. ILFC typically contracts to re lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term. For aircraft returned before the end of the lease term, ILFC has generally been able to re lease such aircraft within two to six months of its return. While some of the lease rates for aircraft that have been redeployed are lower, the effect of these reduced revenues is partially offset by low interest rates, which reduces ILFCs financing costs. As a lessor, ILFC considers an aircraft idle or off lease when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent. ILFC had one aircraft off lease at December 31, 2004. As of March 31, 2005, all new aircraft deliveries in 2005 have been leased, and 92 percent of 2006 new aircraft deliveries have been leased. See also the discussions under Capital Resources and Liquidity herein. ILFC sold two portfolios consisting of 34 and 37 aircraft in 2004 and 2003, respectively, to two trusts connected to securitization transactions. Certain of AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses purchased a large share of the securities issued in connection with these securitizations, which included both debt and equity securities. Management formally reviews regularly, and no less frequently than quarterly, issues affecting ILFCs fleet, including events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft values. Management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary, based on these events and circumstances in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144). ILFC has not recognized any impairment related to its fleet, as the existing service potential of the aircraft in ILFCs portfolio has not been diminished. Further, ILFC has been able to re lease the aircraft without diminution in lease rates to an extent that would require an impairment write down. See also the discussions under Liquidity herein. Capital Markets AIGs Capital Markets operations represents the integrated operations of AIGFP and AIGTG. The integration of its Capital Markets operations has produced and will continue to produce greater efficiencies and product synergies as well as growth opportunities. As Capital Markets is a transaction oriented operation, current and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for predicting future performance. Also, AIGs Capital Markets operations may be adversely affected by the downgrades in AIGs credit ratings. See Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business AIGs Credit Ratings, for a further discussion of the potential effect of the rating downgrades on AIGs Capital Markets businesses. AIGs Capital Markets operations derive substantially all their revenues from proprietary positions entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than from speculative transactions. These subsidiaries participate in the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, and credit products business. As a dealer, AIGFP marks all derivative and trading transactions to fair value daily. Thus, a gain or loss on each transaction is recognized daily. Under GAAP, certain gains and losses are required to be recorded immediately in earnings, whereas in other instances, they are required to be recognized over the life of the underlying contracts. AIGFP hedges the market risks arising from its transactions. Therefore, revenues and operating income are not significantly exposed to or af FORM 10 K : 79 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) fected by market fluctuations and volatility except for the volatility resulting from FAS 133 adjustments on positions that did not qualify for hedge accounting. See the discussion of the effect of FAS 133 under Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements herein. Revenues of the Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in revenues for any given period are significantly affected by the number and size of transactions entered into by these subsidiaries during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period. Operating income and the percentage change in operating income for any period are determined by the number, size and profitability of the transactions attributable to that period relative to those attributable to the prior period. Generally, the realization of trading revenues as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the gain or loss on AIGFPs trading transactions are currently reflected in operating income as the fair values change from period to period. Derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of Capital Markets operations. Therefore, income on interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, and credit derivatives, along with their related hedges, are recorded on a mark to market value or at estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in the income statement in the current year. In 2004, less than five percent of revenues resulted from transactions valued at estimated fair value. The mark to fair value of derivative transactions is reflected in the balance sheet in the captions Unrealized gain on swaps, options and forward transactions and Unrealized loss on swaps, options and forward transactions. Pursuant to ISDA Master Agreements, unrealized gains represent the present value of the aggregate of each net receivable by counterparty, and the unrealized losses represent the present value of the aggregate of each net payable by counterparty as of December 31, 2004. These amounts will change from one period to the next due to changes in interest rates, currency rates, equity and commodity prices and other market variables, as well as cash movements, execution of new transactions and the maturing of existing transactions. See also the discussion under Derivatives herein and Note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. Spread income on investments and borrowings is recorded on an accrual basis over the life of the transaction. Investments are classified as securities available for sale and are marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. AIGFP hedges the economic exposure on its investments and borrowings through its derivatives portfolio. The requirements under FAS 133 hedge accounting were not met for certain of these hedge transactions for the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Where hedge accounting is not achieved, previous adjustments to record the change in value of investments and borrowings in income were required to be reversed. The related investments continue to be classified as securities available for sale. The related U.S. dollar denominated borrowings are carried at cost. AIGFP borrowings in any currency other than the U.S. dollar result in unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses reported as income. Consumer Finance Domestically, AIGs Consumer Finance operations derive a substantial portion of their revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding mortgages, home equity loans, secured and unsecured consumer loans and retail merchant financing. Credit quality continues to be strong and receivables grew substantially. Overseas operations, particularly those in emerging markets, provide credit cards, personal and auto loans, term deposits, savings accounts, sales finance and mortgages. Consumer Finance operations are exposed to loss when contractual payments are not received. Collection exposure is managed through tight underwriting controls, mix of loans and collateral thereon. Financial Services operations for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) (Restated) (Restated) Revenues(a): Aircraft Finance(b) $ 3,251 $ 3,042 $ 2,845 Capital Markets(c)(d) 1,650 549 1,212 Consumer Finance(e) 2,978 2,642 2,473 Other 103 108 74 Total $ 7,982 $ 6,341 $ 6,604 Operating income (loss)(a): Aircraft Finance $ 712 $ 777 $ 795 Capital Markets(d) 1,026 (241 ) 524 Consumer Finance 808 623 507 Other, including intercompany adjustments 67 75 44 Total $ 2,613 $ 1,234 $ 1,870 (a) Includes the unrealized gain (loss) attributable to economic hedges not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses. For 2004, 2003 and 2002, the effect was $(27) million, $49 million and $20 million, respectively, in operating income for Aircraft Finance and $215 million, $(1.09) billion and $(192) million in both revenues and operating income for Capital Markets. (b) Revenues were primarily from ILFC aircraft lease rentals. (c) Revenues, shown net of interest expense, were primarily from AIGFP hedged proprietary positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. (d) Certain transactions entered into by AIGFP generate tax credits and benefits which are shown in the income tax line on the consolidated statement of income. Thus, this source of income is not reflected in the revenues and operating income categories. The amount of tax credits and benefits for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are $114 million, $130 million and $107 million, respectively. (e) Revenues were primarily finance charges. 80 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Financial Services Results Financial Services operating income increased in 2004 compared to 2003. Fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of Capital Markets operations and the volatility resulting from the accounting treatment for the economic hedges under FAS 133. Capital Markets operating income was also negatively affected in 2004 by the costs of the PNC settlement. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. To the extent the Financial Services subsidiaries, other than AIGFP, use derivatives to hedge their assets or liabilities with respect to their future cash flows, and such hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 (as previously discussed in Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements), the changes in fair value of such derivatives are recorded in realized capital gains (losses) or other revenues. Financial market conditions in 2004 compared with 2003 were characterized by interest rates which were broadly unchanged across fixed income markets globally, a tightening of credit spreads and higher equity valuations. Capital Markets results in 2004 compared with 2003 reflected a shift in product segment activity to respond to these conditions. See also Note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. The most significant component of Capital Markets operating expenses is compensation, which was approximately $497 million, $616 million and $557 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The amount of compensation was not affected by unrealized gains or losses attributable to economic hedges, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. The decrease in Aircraft Finance operating income reflects the effect of the disposition of approximately $2 billion in aircraft through securitizations in the third quarter 2003 and first quarter 2004. Offsetting the benefit to operating income of the growth in ILFCs aircraft fleet is a decrease of its lease margin for 2004 compared to 2003. With respect to ILFC, the revenue growth in each year resulted primarily from the increase in flight equipment under operating lease, despite the aforementioned effect of securitizations, and the increase in the relative value of the leased fleet. The decline in ILFCs operating income for 2003 was largely a result of the decline in aircraft remarketing due to the relatively weak market conditions for the sale of secondhand aircraft. ILFC continued to see net improvements in lease rates and an increasing level of interest from traditional buyers, third party investors and debt providers for the purchase of aircraft from ILFCs extensive lease portfolio. Thus, the outlook for 2005 is positive. In connection with a global aircraft lease transaction entered into in 2000 for a total of 14 aircraft, ILFC acquired certain securities of and issued certain guarantees to ATA Airlines and related entities (ATA). During the fourth quarter of 2004, ATA filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On the basis of estimates of the probable outcome of the ATA bankruptcy, ILFC recorded a charge in the fourth quarter to write down the value of the ATA securities and record obligations assumed under the guarantee. The pre tax charges aggregated $54 million (reported as a realized capital loss) and did not have a material effect on AIGs results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. ATA has cured all of the defaults under the existing leases and continues to perform under the leases at the pre bankruptcy contracted lease terms. Consumer Finance operations, both domestically and internationally, did very well with increased revenues and operating income. The increase in Consumer Finance revenues in 2004 was the result of growth in average finance receivables. Credit quality continues to be strong. Foreign Consumer Finance operations performed well, as the operations in Poland continued its strong growth, and the Hong Kong credit card business benefited from the strengthening local economy, resulting in less need for loan loss provisions. Further, reductions of the cost to borrow led to an improvement in the operating income in 2003 over 2002. Financial Services operating income represented 17.5 percent of AIGs consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2004. This compares to 10.6 percent and 23.4 percent in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in contribution percentage in 2004 and the decrease in 2003 was primarily due to the fluctuation in earnings resulting from derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133. The decrease in contribution percentage in 2003 was also influenced by the effect of the 2002 General Insurance loss reserve charge on General Insurance operating income and the reduced contribution of General Insurance operations to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes.

The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. During 2004, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing $4.96 billion. See also the discussion under Operating Review Financial Services Operations and Capital Resources herein. At December 31, 2004, ILFC had committed to purchase 371 new and used aircraft deliverable from 2005 through 2010 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $21.6 billion and had options to purchase six new aircraft deliverable through 2007 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $361 million. As of March 31, 2005, ILFC has entered into leases for all of the new aircraft to be delivered in 2005, 86 of 93 of the new aircraft to be delivered in 2006 and 29 of 166 of the new aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2006. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft currently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing, but there can be no assurance that such success will continue in future environments. AIGs Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products both domestically and overseas. Such products include real estate mortgages, consumer loans, and retail sales finance. These products are funded through deposits and various borrowings including commercial paper and medium term notes. AIGs Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. Over half of the loan balance is related to real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties. With respect to credit losses, the allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio. Capital Markets derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that the effect of any such event would not be significant to AIGs financial condition or its overall liquidity. See also the discussion under Operating Review Financial Services Operations and Derivatives herein. AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, including securities available for sale, at market, and derivative transactions. The funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing GIAs or other AIGFP financings. See also the discussion under Capital Resources herein. 82 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Securities available for sale is predominately a portfolio of debt securities, where the individual securities have varying degrees of credit risk. At December 31, 2004, the average credit rating of this portfolio was AA+ or the equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal review. AIGFP has also entered into credit derivative transactions to economically hedge its credit risk associated with $225 million of these securities. Securities deemed below investment grade at December 31, 2004 amounted to approximately $62 million in fair value representing 0.2 percent of the total AIGFP securities available for sale. There have been no significant downgrades through March 31, 2005. AIGFPs risk management objective is to minimize interest rate, currency, commodity and equity risks associated with its securities available for sale. That is, when AIGFP purchases a security for its securities available for sale investment portfolio, it simultaneously enters into an offsetting internal hedge such that the payment terms of the hedging transaction offset the payment terms of the investment security, which achieves the economic result of converting the return on the underlying security to USD LIBOR plus or minus a spread based on the underlying profit on each security on the initial trade date. The market risk associated with such internal hedges is managed on a portfolio basis, with third party hedging transactions executed as necessary. As hedge accounting treatment is not achieved in accordance with FAS 133, the unrealized gains and losses on these securities, resulting from changes in interest rates, currency rates, commodity and equity prices, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income while the unrealized gains and losses on the related economic hedges are reflected in operating income. When a security is sold, the related hedging transaction is terminated. The realized gain or loss with respect to each security is then recorded in operating income. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized financing transactions. AIGFP takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIGFP further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and, when it deems necessary, it requires additional collateral to be deposited. Trading securities, at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGFP is exposed to credit risk. If its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement, or the credit default swap counterparty failed to perform, AIGFP could have a liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFPs payment obligations, including its debt obligations. AIGFP also conducts, as principal, market making and trading activities in foreign exchange and commodities, primarily precious metals. AIGFP owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures, and option contracts. AIGFP uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. AIGFP supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities, unrealized losses on swaps, short term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased. See also the discussions under Capital Resources herein and Note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. The gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of Capital Markets operations included in the financial services assets and liabilities at December 31, 2004 were as follows: Gross Gross Unrealized Unrealized (in millions) Gains Losses Securities available for sale, at market value(a) $ 1,706 $ 103 Unrealized gain/loss on swaps, options and forward transactions(b) 22,670 18,132 (a) See also Note 8(h) of Notes to Financial Statements. (b) These amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts. AIGFPs interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale, at market, are economically managed by taking internal offsetting positions on a security by security basis with its derivatives portfolio, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation. As previously discussed in Financial Services Results these economic offsets do not meet the hedge accounting requirements of FAS 133. Trading securities, at market value, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value, are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These trading securities are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of Capital Markets operations. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for Capital Markets operations. AIGs senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market, operational and credit issues of the Capital Markets operations. The senior management of AIGFP reports the results of its operations to and reviews future strategies with AIGs senior management. FORM 10 K : 83 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) AIG actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIG must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. AIGFP held a large portfolio of privately negotiated financing transactions with institutional counterparties in the United Kingdom. Certain provisions in the UK Finance Bill that was published by the House of Commons on March 22, 2005 have caused AIGFPs counterparties to exercise rights to unwind these transactions early. Although the unwind of these transactions will not cause AIGFP to suffer any losses, the unwinds do mean that AIGFP will not realize spread income in the future that AIGFP expects it would have realized had the transactions remained outstanding. The aggregate reduction in 2005 operating income attributable to such foregone future accrual earnings is currently expected to be approximately $75 million. Asset Management Operations AIGs Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety of investment related services and investment products including institutional and retail asset management, broker dealer services and spread based investment business from the sale of guaranteed investment contracts, also known as funding agreements (GICs). Such services and products are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas. As discussed above, AIG Retirement Services operations are now reported with Life Insurance operations. Therefore, Asset Management operations now represent the results of AIGs asset management and brokerage services operations, mutual fund operations and the foreign and domestic GIC operations. Asset Management revenues and operating income for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) (Restated) (Restated) Revenues: Guaranteed Investment Contracts $ 3,191 $ 2,621 $ 2,559 Institutional Asset Management(a) 1,035 661 547 Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds 249 206 227 Other 217 155 152 Total $ 4,692 $ 3,643 $ 3,485 Operating income: Guaranteed Investment Contracts $ 1,014 $ 657 $ 674 Institutional Asset Management(a)(b) 501 217 140 Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds 70 60 48 Other 205 144 144 Total $ 1,790 $ 1,078 $ 1,006 (a) Includes AIG Global Investment Group and certain smaller asset management operations. (b) Includes the results of certain AIG managed private equity and real estate funds that are consolidated effective December 31, 2003 pursuant to FIN46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. For 2004, operating income includes $195 million of third party limited partner earnings offset in Minority interest expense. Asset Management Results Asset Management operating income increased in 2004 as a result of the upturn in worldwide financial markets and a strong global product portfolio. The operating income growth results from fees related to the management of mutual funds and various investment portfolios that are, in great part, contingent upon the growth in the equity markets and customer interest in equity sensitive products. Thus, as equity markets expand and contract, the appetite for listed and private equity investments changes. The revenues and operating income with respect to this segment are similarly affected. GICs are sold domestically and abroad to both institutions and individuals. These products are written on an opportunistic basis when market conditions are favorable. Thus, revenues, operating income and cash flow attributable to GICs will vary from one reporting period to the next. AIG expects to launch a matched investment program utilizing issuances of AIG debt securities, which will become AIGs principal spread based investment activity. In light of recent developments, the timing of the launch of this program is unclear. See Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business Access to Capital Markets for a discussion of how the timing of this program may be delayed. Because AIGs credit spreads in the capital markets have widened following the ratings declines, there may be a reduction in the earnings on new business in AIGs institutional spread based funding business. Asset Management operating income represented 12.0 percent of AIGs consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2004. This compares to 9.2 percent and 12.6 percent in 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2004, AIGs third party assets under management, including both retail mutual funds and institu 84 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries tional accounts, approximated $53 billion and the aggregate GIC reserve was $54.1 billion. Other Operations Other income (deductions) net includes AIGs equity in certain minor majority owned subsidiaries and certain partially owned companies, realized foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in substantially all currencies and unrealized gains and losses in hyperinflationary currencies, the cash distributions on the liabilities connected to trust preferred stock, as well as the income and expenses of the parent holding company and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Other income (deductions) net amounted to $(334) million, $(1.17) billion and $(606) million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. AIGs equity in certain partially owned subsidiaries includes $96 million in catastrophe losses in 2004. The decline in 2003 was primarily the result of increases in pension and interest expenses. Capital Resources At December 31, 2004, AIG had total consolidated shareholders equity of $80.61 billion and total borrowings of $95.26 billion. At that date, $85.28 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by AIG or were AIGFPs matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) or matched notes and bonds payable. Borrowings At December 31, 2004, AIGs net borrowings were $8.50 billion after reflecting amounts that were matched borrowings under AIGFPs obligations of GIAs, matched notes and bonds payable, amounts not guaranteed by AIG and liabilities connected to trust preferred stock. The following table summarizes borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003 (Restated): December 31, 2003 (in millions) 2004 (Restated) AIGs net borrowings $ 8,498 $ 7,469 Liabilities connected to trust preferred stock 1,489 1,682 AIGFP GIAs 18,919 15,337 Matched notes and bonds payable 20,624 16,735 Borrowings not guaranteed by AIG 45,733 38,986 Total debt $ 95,263 $ 80,209 Borrowings issued or guaranteed by AIG and those borrowings not guaranteed by AIG at December 31, 2004 and 2003 (Restated) were as follows: December 31, 2003 (in millions) 2004 (Restated) AIG borrowings: Medium term notes $ 667 $ 791 Notes and bonds payable 2,980 3,141 Loans and mortgages payable 349 337 Total 3,996 4,269 Borrowings guaranteed by AIG: AIGFP GIAs 18,919 15,337 Notes and bonds payable 21,062 17,468 Total 39,981 32,805 AIG Funding, Inc. commercial paper 2,969 1,223 AGC Notes and bonds payable 1,095 1,244 Liabilities connected to trust preferred stock 1,489 1,682 Total borrowings issued or guaranteed by AIG 49,530 41,223 Borrowings not guaranteed by AIG: ILFC Commercial paper 2,670 1,575 Medium term notes 5,972 5,960 Notes and bonds payable(a) 15,734 14,431 Loans and mortgages payable(b) 40 143 Total 24,416 22,109 AGF Commercial paper 3,686 2,877 Medium term notes 13,709 9,704 Notes and bonds payable 1,585 1,739 Total 18,980 14,320 Commercial paper: AIG Credit Card Company (Taiwan) 359 250 AIG Finance (Taiwan) Limited 9 13 Total 368 263 Loans and mortgages payable: AIGCFG 792 624 AIG Finance (Hong Kong) Limited 49 161 Total 841 785 Other Subsidiaries 829 725 (continued) FORM 10 K : 85 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) December 31, 2003 (in millions) 2004 (Restated) Variable Interest Entity debt: ILFC(c) 464 AIG Global Investment Group 6 AIG Global Real Estate Investment 8 AIG Capital Partners 165 148 AIG SunAmerica 126 166 Total 299 784 Total borrowings not guaranteed by AIG 45,733 38,986 Total debt $ 95,263 $ 80,209 (a) Includes borrowings under Export Credit Facility of $1.7 billion. (b) Capital lease obligations. (c) Synthetic lease obligations expired in September 2004. For a description of the effects on AIGs capital resources, including the cost of borrowing, of recent downgrades and rating actions by the major rating agencies, see the discussion under Outlook herein and Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business AIGs Credit Ratings, as well as Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. During 2004, AIG did not issue any medium term notes, and $124 million of previously issued notes matured or were redeemed. AIG completed an exchange offer in April 2004 with respect to Rule 144A/ Regulation S Notes and issued in exchange substantially identical notes that are registered under the Securities Act. On August 15, 2004, Eurodollar zero coupon notes with a face value of $189 million matured. AIG intends to continue its customary practice of issuing debt securities from time to time to meet its financing needs and those of certain of its subsidiaries for general corporate purposes, as well as to initiate a matched investment program. However AIGs ability to do so may be limited due to the delay in filing its periodic financial reports. See Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business Access to Capital Markets. On November 9, 2001, AIG received proceeds of approximately $1 billion from the issuance of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031 with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of approximately $1.52 billion. Commencing January 1, 2002, the debentures are convertible into shares of AIG common stock at a conversion rate of 6.0627 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures if AIG common stock trades at certain levels for certain time periods. The debentures are callable by AIG on or after November 9, 2006. Also, holders can require AIG to repurchase these debentures once every five years beginning on November 9, 2006. AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities and derivative transactions. The borrowings may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. See also the discussions under Operating Review, Liquidity and Derivatives herein and Notes 1, 8, 9 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. AIGFP has established a Euro Medium Term Note Program under which an aggregate principal amount of up to $5.0 billion of notes may be outstanding. The program provides that additional notes may be issued to replace matured or redeemed notes. As of December 31, 2004, $7.24 billion of notes had been issued under the program, $4.57 billion of which were outstanding, including $213 million resulting from foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars. Notes issued under this program are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. AIG Funding, Inc. (AIG Funding), through the issuance of commercial paper, helps fulfill the short term cash requirements of AIG and its subsidiaries. AIG Funding intends to continue to meet AIGs funding requirements through the issuance of commercial paper guaranteed by AIG. The issuance of AIG Fundings commercial paper is subject to the approval of AIGs Board of Directors. AIG and AIG Funding are parties to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities aggregating $2.75 billion, consisting of $1.375 billion in a 364 day revolving credit facility that expires in July of 2005 and $1.375 billion in a five year revolving credit facility that expires in July of 2007. The 364 day facility allows for the conversion by AIG of any outstanding loans at expiration into one year term loans. The facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for AIGs commercial paper programs administered by AIG Funding. AIG expects to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under these facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2004. AIG obtained waivers from the lenders under these revolving credit facilities providing for the extension of the delivery date of AIGs consolidated financial statements for year end 2004 and for the first quarter of 2005 through June 30, 2005. AIG is also a party to an unsecured inter company revolving credit facility provided by certain of its subsidiaries aggregating $2 billion that expires in October of 2005. The facility allows for the conversion of any outstanding loans at expiration into one year term loans. The facility can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for AIGs commercial paper programs. AIG expects to replace or extend this credit facility on or prior to its expiration. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under the inter company facility, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2004. 86 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries As of November 2001, AIG guaranteed the notes and bonds of AGC. During 2002, AGC issued $200 million in notes which matured in March 2003. During 2004, $149 million of previously issued notes matured. Preferred stock issued by an AGC subsidiary, American General Capital I, with a liquidation value of $200 million was redeemed for cash on September 8, 2004. AGC redeemed the related Junior Subordinated Debentures at that time, extinguishing the liabilities connected to the trust preferred stock. ILFC fulfills its short term cash requirements through the issuance of commercial paper. The issuance of commercial paper is subject to the approval of ILFCs Board of Directors and is not guaranteed by AIG. ILFC is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities aggregating $6.0 billion at December 31, 2004. The facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for ILFCs commercial paper program and consist of $4.0 billion in a 364 day revolving credit facility that expires in October 2005, with a one year term out option, and $2.0 billion in a five year revolving credit facility that expires in October 2009. ILFC expects to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration. There are currently no borrowings under these facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2004. During 2004, ILFC increased the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its medium term and long term notes, which included $518 million resulting from foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars as of year end. ILFC had $13.13 billion of debt securities registered for public sale at December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, $5.59 billion of debt securities were issued. In addition, ILFC has a Euro Medium Term Note Program for $7.0 billion, under which $4.48 billion in notes were sold through December 31, 2004. ILFC has substantially eliminated the currency exposure arising from foreign currency denominated notes by either hedging the notes through swaps or through the offset provided by operating lease payments in Euros. Notes issued under this program are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit Facility for use in connection with the purchase of approximately 75 aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility was guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on these amortizing ten year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At December 31, 2004, ILFC had $1.5 billion outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. In May 2004, ILFC entered into a similarly structured Export Credit Facility (ECA) for up to a maximum of $2.64 billion for Airbus aircraft to be delivered in 2004 and 2005. The facility becomes available as the various European Export Credit Agencies provide their guarantees for aircraft based on a six month forward looking calendar, and the interest rate is determined through a bid process. At December 31, 2004, ILFC had $202 million outstanding under this facility. Borrowings with respect to these facilities are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. In August 2004, ILFC received a commitment for an Ex Im Bank comprehensive guarantee in the amount of $1.68 billion to support the financing of up to 30 new Boeing aircraft. The delivery period initially extends from September 1, 2004 through August 31, 2005, but may be extended to August 31, 2006. ILFC did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2004. During 2003, ILFC entered into various bank financings for a total funded amount of $1.3 billion. The financings mature through 2009. One tranche of one of the loans totaling $410 million was funded in Japanese yen and swapped to U.S. dollars. The proceeds of ILFCs debt financing are primarily used to purchase flight equipment, including progress payments during the construction phase. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. See also the discussions under Operating Review and Liquidity herein. AGF fulfills its short term cash requirements through the issuance of commercial paper. The issuance of commercial paper is subject to the approval of AGFs Board of Directors and is not guaranteed by AIG. AGF is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities aggregating $3.25 billion, consisting of $1.75 billion in a 364 day revolving credit facility that expires in July of 2005 and $1.5 billion in a five year revolving credit facility that expires in July of 2007. The 364 day facility allows for the conversion by AGF of any outstanding loans at expiration into one year term loans. The facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for AGFs commercial paper programs. AGF expects to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration. There are currently no borrowings under these AGF facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2004. AGF is also party to several bilateral credit agreements aggregating $260 million at March 31, 2005. The terms and FORM 10 K : 87 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) conditions of these agreements are identical to AGFs 364 day revolving credit facility. During 2004, AGF issued $2.96 billion of fixed rate and variable rate medium term notes ranging in maturities from two to ten years. As of December 31, 2004, notes aggregating $13.71 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2005 to 2014 at interest rates ranging from 1.38 percent to 7.50 percent. To the extent deemed appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing with respect to these notes. In addition, AGF issued $2.86 billion of long term funding in 2004 from sources including Euro denominated and Sterling denominated transactions totaling the equivalent of $1.82 billion. Other funding sources included private placement debt, retail note issuances and bank financings. AIG Credit Card Company (Taiwan) (AIGCCC Taiwan) and AIG Finance (Taiwan) Limited (AIGF Taiwan), both consumer finance subsidiaries in Taiwan, have issued commercial paper for the funding of their own operations. At December 31, 2004, AIG did not guarantee the commercial paper of any of its subsidiaries other than AIG Funding.

(c) Insurance and investment contract liabilities include various investment type products with contractually scheduled maturities including periodic payments of a term certain nature and guaranteed maturities under guaranteed investment contracts. Items excluded from the table include (i) liabilities for future policy benefits of approximately $105 billion, and (ii) policyholder contract deposits of approximately $165 billion. Amounts excluded from the table are generally comprised of policies or contracts where (i) AIG is currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship, or (iii) the occurrence of a payment due to a surrender or other non scheduled event out of AIGs control. The determination of these liability amounts and timing of payment are not reasonably fixed and determinable. Significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns, inflation, and future policyholder elections as to benefits. The maturity schedule of AIGs other commercial commitments by segment at December 31, 2004 was as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration Less One Four Total Than Through Through After Amounts One Three Five Five (in millions) Committed Year Years Years Years Letters of credit: Life Insurance & Retirement Services $ 185 $ 81 $ 4 $ $ 100 DBG 211 115 96 Standby letters of credit: Capital Markets 1,556 2 43 35 1,476 Guarantees: Life Insurance & Retirement Services(a) 2,523 225 340 1,958 Asset Management 156 105 40 11 Other commercial commitments(b): Capital Markets(c) 16,286 484 1,933 3,023 10,846 Aircraft Finance(d) 853 234 361 258 Life Insurance & Retirement Services(e) 2,275 429 753 278 815 Asset Management 347 250 97 DBG(f) 1,519 1,519 Total $ 25,911 $ 1,925 $ 3,667 $ 3,347 $ 16,972 (a) Primarily AIG SunAmerica construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments.

(d) Primarily in connection with options to acquire aircraft. (e) Primarily AIG SunAmerica commitments to invest in partnerships. (f) Primarily commitments to invest in limited partnerships. FORM 10 K : 89 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Rating triggers have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. Rating triggers generally relate to events which (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. AIG believes that any of its or its subsidiaries contractual obligations that are subject to ratings triggers or financial covenants relating to ratings triggers would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, future operating results or liquidity. As a result of the downgrades of AIGs long term senior debt ratings, AIG has been required to post approximately $1.16 billion of collateral with counterparties to municipal guaranteed investment contracts and financial derivatives transactions. In the event of a further downgrade, AIG will be required to post additional collateral. It is estimated that, as of the close of business on May 18, 2005, based on AIGs outstanding municipal guaranteed investment contracts and financial derivatives transactions as of such date, a further downgrade of AIGs long term senior debt ratings to Aa3 by Moodys or AA by S&P would permit counterparties to call for approximately $2.33 billion of additional collateral. Further, additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral, which could have a material effect on how AIG manages its liquidity. The actual amount of additional collateral that AIG would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions, the market value of the outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. The requirement to post additional collateral may increase if additional counterparties begin to require credit support from AIG through collateralization agreements. Additional obligations to post collateral will increase the demand on AIGs liquidity. Shareholders Equity AIGs consolidated shareholders equity increased $10.58 billion during 2004. During 2004, retained earnings increased $9.0 billion, resulting from net income less dividends. Unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes, increased $1.35 billion and the cumulative translation adjustment loss, net of taxes, decreased $686 million. During 2004, there was a gain of $333 million, net of taxes, relating to derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments. See also the discussion under Operating Review and Liquidity herein, Notes 1(z), 8(d) and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities. Stock Purchase During 2004, AIG purchased in the open market 16,299,300 shares of its common stock. AIG from time to time may buy shares of its common stock in the open market for general corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans. At December 31, 2004, an additional 39,019,800 shares could be purchased under the then current authorization by AIGs Board of Directors. Through March 31, 2005, AIG purchased an additional 2,477,100 shares of its common stock. Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. With respect to AIGs domestic insurance subsidiaries, the payment of any dividend requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled. Under the laws of many states, an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain regulatory thresholds. Largely as a result of the restrictions, approximately 89 percent of consolidated shareholders equity was restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 2004. However, AIG cannot predict how recent regulatory investigations may affect the ability of its regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. See Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business Regulatory Investigations. With respect to AIGs foreign insurance subsidiaries, the most significant insurance regulatory jurisdictions include Bermuda, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Thailand and Singapore. AIG cannot predict whether the regulatory investigations currently underway or future regulatory issues will impair AIGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. To AIGs knowledge, no AIG company is currently on any regulatory or similar watch list with regard to solvency. See also the discussion under Liquidity herein and Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements, as well as Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business. 90 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Regulation and Supervision AIGs insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. In the U.S. the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance companys statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. At December 31, 2004, the risk based adjusted surplus of each of AIGs Domestic General companies and of each of AIGs Domestic Life companies exceeded each of their RBC standards. As discussed above, various regulators have commenced investigations into certain insurance business practices, including with respect to AIG. While such investigations are in their early stages, it is possible that they may result in additional regulation of the insurance industry and specific action with respect to AIG, and AIG cannot predict the ultimate effect that such additional regulation might have on its business. Federal, state or local legislation may affect AIGs ability to operate and expand its various financial services businesses, and changes in the current laws, regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses. See Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business Regulatory Investigations for a further discussion of the effect these investigations may have on AIGs businesses. AIGs U.S. operations are negatively affected under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities. Therefore, the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated. The guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $118 million, $77 million and $76 million, respectively. AIG is also required to participate in various involuntary pools (principally workers compensation business) which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets. This participation is also recorded upon notification, as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated. A substantial portion of AIGs General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIGs insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIGs international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of AIGs operations without compensation. Adverse effects resulting from any one country may affect AIGs results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIGs net financial exposure at that time in that country. Foreign operations are individually subject to local solvency margin requirements that require maintenance of adequate capitalization, which AIG complies with by country. In addition, certain foreign locations, notably Japan, have established regulations that can result in guarantee fund assessments. These have not had a material effect on AIGs operations. Liquidity AIGs liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its General and Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations. Management believes that AIGs liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to short term funding through commercial paper and bank credit facilities will enable it to meet any anticipated cash requirements. See Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business Access to Capital Markets. At December 31, 2004, AIGs consolidated invested assets included $18.11 billion of cash and short term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2004 amounted to $35.58 billion. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders contract deposits, cash flows from investment operations and paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, and acquisition and operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses. See also the discussions under Operating Review General Insurance FORM 10 K : 91 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operations and Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations herein. With respect to General Insurance operations, if paid losses accelerated beyond AIGs ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, AIG might need to liquidate a portion of its General Insurance investment portfolio and or arrange for financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of several significant catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time. Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable significantly decreased in value. See also the discussions under Operating Review General Insurance Operations herein. With respect to Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations, if a substantial portion of the Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and or defaulted, AIG might need to liquidate other portions of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolio and or arrange financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic collapse of a nation or region in which AIG Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations exist, nationalization, terrorist acts, or other such economic or political upheaval. In addition, a significant rise in interest rates leading to a significant increase in policyholder surrenders could also create a liquidity strain. See also the discussions under Operating Review Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations herein. In addition to the combined insurance pretax operating cash flow, AIGs insurance operations held $7.63 billion in cash and short term investments at December 31, 2004. Operating cash flow and the cash and short term balances held provided AIGs insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase predominately high quality and diversified fixed income securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities, and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans, and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately $126 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately $184 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 2004. AIGs major Financial Services operating subsidiaries consist of AIGFP, ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG. Sources of funds considered in meeting the liquidity needs of AIGFPs operations include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long term and short term debt, maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased. ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG all utilize the commercial paper markets, bank loans and bank credit facilities as sources of liquidity. ILFC and AGF also fund in the domestic and international capital markets without reliance on any guarantee from AIG. An additional source of liquidity for ILFC is the use of export credit facilities. AIGCFG also uses wholesale and retail bank deposits as sources of funds. On occasion, AIG has provided equity capital to ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG and provides intercompany loans to AIGCFG. Cash flow provided from operations is a major source of liquidity for AIGs primary Financial Services operating subsidiaries. AIG, the parent company, funds its short term working capital needs through commercial paper issued by AIG Funding. As of March 31, 2005, AIG Funding had $3.485 billion of commercial paper outstanding with an average maturity of 26 days. As additional liquidity, AIG parent has a $2 billion inter company revolving credit facility provided by certain of its subsidiaries, a $1.375 billion 364 day revolving bank credit facility that expires in July 2005 and a $1.375 billion five year revolving bank credit facility that expires in July 2007. AIG parents primary sources of cash flow are dividends and loans from its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of regulatory restrictions, approximately 89 percent of consolidated shareholders equity was restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 2004. However AIG cannot predict how recent regulatory investigations may affect the ability of its regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. See Certain Factors Affecting AIGs Business Regulatory Investigations. AIG parents primary uses of cash flow are for debt service and the payment of dividends to shareholders. As of March 31, 2005, including debt obligations of AGC that are guaranteed by AIG, remaining debt maturities due in 2005 are $300 million, $55 million and $500 million for the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. See also Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on debt maturities for AIG and its subsidiaries. Special Purpose Vehicles and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements AIG uses special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. As a result of recent changes in accounting, a number of SPVs and off balance sheet arrangements have been reflected in AIGs consolidated financial statements. In addition, certain entities have 92 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries been consolidated in connection with the restatement of AIGs financial statements. See Notes 2 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). FIN 46 addressed the consolidation and disclosure rules for nonoperating entities that are now defined as Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). In December 2003, FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46R). AIG has restrictive guidelines with respect to the formation of and investment in SPVs and off balance sheet arrangements. In particular, AIG has expanded the responsibility of its Complex Structured Financial Transaction Committee (CSFT) to include the review of any transaction that could enable a third party to achieve an accounting or financial reporting result that is not in conformity with applicable GAAP or subject AIG to heightened legal, reputational, regulatory or other risk. See Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A of Part II for a further discussion of the CSFT. For additional information related to AIGs activities with respect to VIEs and certain guarantees see Recent Accounting Standards herein and also Notes 1 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. Also, for additional disclosure regarding AIGs commercial commitments (including guarantors), see Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments herein. Derivatives Derivatives are financial instruments among two or more parties with returns linked to or derived from some underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or index. Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities, certain commodities, financial or commodity indices, or other variables. The more significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures and options. In the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty. The overwhelming majority of AIGs derivatives activities are conducted by the Capital Markets operations, thus permitting AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates, securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. AIGs customers such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. To help manage this risk, AIGFPs credit department operates within the guidelines set by the AIG Credit Risk Committee. This committee establishes the credit policy, sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account other factors, including the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIGs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when appropriate. In addition, AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, and margin agreements to reduce the credit risk relating to its outstanding derivative financial transactions. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and the transactions size and maturity. AIGs Derivatives Review Committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction or program except those derivative transactions entered into by AIGFP with third parties. The committee examines, among other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. Generally, AIG conducts its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment. Thus, exchange gains or losses occur when AIGs foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar from one reporting period to the next. FAS 133 requires that third party derivatives used for hedging must be specifically matched with the underlying exposures to an outside third party and documented contemporaneously to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. In many cases AIG did not meet these hedging requirements with respect to certain hedging transactions. AIG has historically reported the changes in the fair value of certain derivatives used for hedging activities through other comprehensive income in consolidated shareholders equity or in net income with a corresponding adjustment to the hedged FORM 10 K : 93 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) item, depending on the nature of the hedge relationship. In order to comply with FAS 133, the restated consolidated financial statements include the changes in fair value for certain derivatives, previously recorded through other comprehensive income, in current period income and reverse the previous adjustments on assets and liabilities recorded in net income in connection with hedge accounting. Because these derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities requires AIG to recognize the corresponding changes in fair value, including foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations relating to available for sale investments through other comprehensive income. These restatement adjustments with respect to FAS 133 do not result in any changes in AIGs liquidity or its overall financial condition even though inter period volatility of earnings increased. See also Notes 2 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements for detailed information relating to AIGs derivative activities, and Note 1(z) of Notes to Financial Statements for AIGs derivative accounting policies. Managing Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies, equities and commodity prices. AIG has exposures to these risks. AIG analyzes market risk using various statistical techniques including Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that applies the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors to AIGs market positions. The output from the VaR calculation is the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models. AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management. Insurance AIG has performed a separate VaR analysis for the General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services segments and for each market risk within each segment. For purposes of the VaR calculation, the insurance assets and liabilities from GICs are included in the Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment. For the calculations in the analyses the financial instrument assets included are the insurance segments invested assets, excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued, and the financial instrument liabilities included are reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and other policyholders funds. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of each of AIGs insurance segments as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. The VaR number represents the maximum potential loss that could be incurred with a 95 percent confidence (i.e., only five percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the VaR figure) within a one month holding period. AIG uses the historical simulation methodology that entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. AIG uses the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices. For each scenario, each transaction was repriced. Portfolio, business unit, and finally AIG wide scenario values are then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities. The following table presents the VaR on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of AIGs insurance segments as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Due to diversification effects, the combined VaR is always smaller than the sum of its components. Life Insurance & General Insurance Retirement Services (in millions) 2004 2003 2004 2003 Market risk: Combined $ 1,396 $ 1,100 $ 5,024 $ 3,075 Interest rate 1,563 1,173 4,750 2,967 Currency 139 125 478 257 Equity 727 797 1,024 758 94 : FORM 10 K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the average, high and low VaRs on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of AIGs insurance segments as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Due to diversification effects, the combined VaR is always smaller than the sum of its components. 2004 2003 (in millions) Average High Low Average High Low General Insurance: Market risk: Combined $ 1,299 $ 1,497 $ 1,100 $ 888 $ 1,120 $ 658 Interest rate 1,407 1,591 1,173 732 1,173 411 Currency 111 139 88 94 147 64 Equity 744 797 688 781 935 631 Life Insurance & Retirement Services: Market risk: Combined $ 4,021 $ 5,024 $ 3,075 $ 2,262 $ 3,419 $ 1,299 Interest rate 3,831 4,750 2,967 2,207 3,347 1,376 Currency 326 478 257 204 257 166 Equity 884 1,024 758 762 975 627 VaR figures are typically amplified when yields fall dramatically over time. The notable increase in the Combined and Interest rate VaRs from 2003 to 2004 in the Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment was predominantly caused by continuing declines in yields throughout Asia, along with strong growth in the Asian life businesses. Financial Services AIG generally manages its market exposures within Financial Services by maintaining offsetting positions. Capital Markets seeks to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered market positions. Credit exposure is managed separately. See the discussion on the management of credit risk above. AIGs Market Risk Management Department provides detailed independent review of AIGs market exposures, particularly those market exposures of the Capital Markets operations. This department determines whether AIGs market risks, as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries, are within the parameters established by AIGs senior management. Well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used. Additionally, this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary. ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, AIG statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a VaR model. In this analysis, the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue, and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt. The estimated effect of the current derivative positions was also taken into account. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations using the historical simulation methodology, as previously described. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the average VaR with respect to the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations was approximately $70 million and $38 million, respectively. Capital Markets operations are exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. AIGFP hedges its exposure to these risks primarily through swaps, options, forwards, and futures. To economically hedge interest rate risks, AIGFP may also purchase U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP does not seek to manage the market risk of each transaction through an individual third party offsetting transaction. Rather, AIGFP takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposures. AIGFP values the predominant portion of its market sensitive transactions by marking them to market currently through income. A smaller portion is priced by estimated fair value based upon a conservative extrapolation of market factors. There is another limited portion of transactions where changes in fair value are not recorded through income currently and gains or losses are accrued over the life of the transactions. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by AIGFP and AIG management. AIGFP manages market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts, and other transactions as appropriate. The recorded values of these transactions may be different from the values that might be realized if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations, FORM 10 K : 95 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) financial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity. AIGFP attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription services such as from Bloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model. When such prices are not available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. Historically, actual results have not materially deviated from these models. Systems used by Capital Markets operations can monitor each units respective market positions on an intraday basis. AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and therefore is open for business essentially 24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the clock. AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect significant potential market movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices, volatility levels, and the effect of time. These techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio. The results from these analyses are regularly reviewed by AIG management. As described above, Capital Markets operations are exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices as well as implied volatilities thereon. AIG statistically measures the losses of fair value through the application of a VaR model across Capital Markets. Capital Markets asset and liability portfolios for which the VaR analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments, derivative instruments and commodities. Because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale, at market, is substantially hedged, segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary. The VaR calculation is unaffected by the accounting treatment of hedged transactions under FAS 133. In the calculation of VaR for Capital Markets operations, AIG uses the same historical simulation methodology, described under Insurance above, which entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. AIGFP has recently enhanced its library of factors by including implied option volatilities to construct the historical scenarios for simulation. The following table presents the VaR on a combined basis and of each component of risk for Capital Markets operations as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Recent Accounting Standards In December 2003, FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46 (FIN46R). See also Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements. In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 03 1. See also Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. At the March 2004 meeting, the Emerging Issue Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus with respect to Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. On September 30, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF Issue 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. At the September 2004 meeting, the EITF reached a consensus with respect to Issue No. 04 8, Accounting Issues Related to Certain Features of Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings per Share. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Share Based Payment.
