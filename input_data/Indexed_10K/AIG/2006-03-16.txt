ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful. Statutory underwriting profit (loss) and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with AIGs insurance competitors. AIG has also incorporated into this discussion a number of cross references to additional information included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide the reader a narrative with respect to AIGs operations, financial condition and liquidity and certain other significant matters.

These projections and statements are not historical facts but instead represent only AIGs belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside AIGs control. These projections and statements may address, among other things, the status and potential future outcome of the current regulatory and civil proceedings against AIG and their potential effect on AIGs businesses, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, the effect of the credit rating downgrades on AIGs businesses and competitive position, the unwinding and resolving of various relationships between AIG and Starr and SICO and AIGs strategy for growth, product development, market position, financial results and reserves. It is possible that AIGs actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these projections and statements. Factors that could cause AIGs actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those in the specific projections and statements are discussed throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Risk Factors in Item 1A, Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligations) to update or alter any projection or other statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. AIG Form 10 K 25 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Overview of Operations and Business Results In 2003 and prior years, AIGs operations were conducted by its subsidiaries principally through four operating segments: General Insurance, Life Insurance, Financial Services and Retirement Services & Asset Management. Beginning with the first quarter of 2004, AIG reports Retirement Services results in the same segment as Life Insurance, reflecting the convergence of protective financial and retirement products and AIGs current management of these operations. All financial information herein gives effect to the Restatements described in The Restatements under Item 1. Business. Information for years prior to 2005 included herein has been reclassified to show AIGs results of operations and financial position on a comparable basis with the 2005 presentation. Through these segments, AIG provides insurance and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. This geographic, product and service diversification is one of AIGs major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors. The importance of this diversification was especially evident in 2005, when record catastrophe losses, settlements of legal proceedings and charges for increases in reserves for loss and loss expenses, were more than offset by profitability in other segments and product lines. Although regional economic downturns or political upheaval could negatively affect parts of AIGs operations, AIG believes that its diversification makes it unlikely that regional difficulties would have a material effect on its operating results, financial condition or liquidity. AIGs subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. In the United States, AIG companies are the largest underwriters of commercial and industrial insurance and one of the largest life insurance and retirement services operations as well. AIGs Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides asset management services and offers guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) to institutions and individuals. A primary goal of AIG in managing its General Insurance operations is to achieve an underwriting profit. To achieve this goal, AIG must be disciplined in its risk selection and premiums must be adequate and terms and conditions appropriate to cover the risk accepted. AIG believes in strict control of expenses. AIGs 2005 operating performance reflects continuing implementation of various long term strategies in its various operating segments. A central focus of AIG operations in recent years is the development and expansion of new distribution channels. In 2005, AIG continued to expand its distribution channels in many Asian countries, which now include banks, credit card companies and television media home shopping. In late 2003, AIG entered into an agreement with PICC Property and Casualty Company, Limited (PICC), which will enable the marketing of accident and health products throughout China through PICCs branch networks and agency system. AIG participates in the underwriting results through a reinsurance agreement and also holds a 9.9 percent ownership interest in PICC. Other examples of new distribution channels used both domestically and overseas include banks, affinity groups, direct response and e commerce. AIG patiently builds relationships in markets around the world where it sees long term growth opportunities. For example, the fact that AIG has the only wholly owned foreign life insurance operations in eight cities in China is the result of relationships developed over nearly 30 years. AIGs more recent expansion of operations into India, Vietnam, Russia and other emerging markets reflect the same growth strategy. Moreover, AIG believes in investing in the economies and infrastructures of these countries and growing with them. When AIG companies enter a new jurisdiction, they typically offer both basic protection and savings products. As the economies evolve, AIGs products evolve with them, to more complex and investment oriented models. Growth for AIG may be generated both internally and through acquisitions which both fulfill strategic goals and offer adequate return on investment. In recent years, the acquisitions of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life have broadened AIGs penetration of the Japanese market through new distribution channels and will result in operating efficiencies as they are integrated into AIGs previously existing companies operating in Japan. AIG provides leadership on issues of concern to the global and local economies as well as the insurance and financial services industries. In recent years, efforts to reform the tort system and class action litigation procedures, legislation to deal with the asbestos problem and the renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act have been key issues, while in prior years trade legislation and Superfund had been issues of concern. The following table summarizes AIGs revenues, income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Total revenues $ 108,905 $ 97,666 $ 79,421 Income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes 15,213 14,845 11,907 Net income $ 10,477 $ 9,839 $ 8,108 Consolidated Results The 12 percent growth in revenues in 2005 and 23 percent growth in revenues in 2004 were primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned from global General Insurance operations as well as growth in both General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services net investment income and Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums. An additional factor was the capital gains realized in 2004 rather than the capital losses realized in 2003. 26 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AIGs income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes increased 2 percent in 2005 when compared to 2004 and 25 percent in 2004 when compared to 2003. Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management operating income gains accounted for the increase over 2004 and 2003 in both pretax income and net income. Somewhat offsetting these gains in 2005 was the effect of the charges related to regulatory settlements, as described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The following table summarizes the net effect of catastrophe losses for December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Pretax(*) $ 3,280 $ 1,155 $ 83 Net of tax and minority interest 2,109 729 53 (*) Includes $312 million and $96 million in catastrophe losses from partially owned companies in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following table summarizes the operations of each principal segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. See also Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues(a): General Insurance(b) $ 45,174 $ 41,961 $ 33,833 Life Insurance & Retirement Services(c) 47,316 43,400 36,678 Financial Services(d) 10,525 7,495 6,242 Asset Management(e) 5,325 4,714 3,651 Other 565 96 (983 ) Total $ 108,905 $ 97,666 $ 79,421 Operating Income(a)(f)(g): General Insurance $ 2,315 $ 3,177 $ 4,502 Life Insurance & Retirement Services 8,844 7,923 6,807 Financial Services 4,276 2,180 1,182 Asset Management 2,253 2,125 1,316 Other(h)(i) (2,475 ) (560 ) (1,900 ) Total $ 15,213 $ 14,845 $ 11,907 (a) Includes the effect of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, the effect was $(34) million, $(27) million and $49 million, respectively, in operating income for Aircraft Finance and $2.01 billion, $(122) million and $(1.01) billion in revenues and operating income, respectively, for Capital Markets (AIGFP). (b) Represents the sum of General Insurance net premiums earned, net investment income and realized capital gains (losses). (c) Represents the sum of Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums, net investment income and realized capital gains (losses). Included in realized capital gains (losses) is the effect of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 and the application of FAS 52 of $(437) million, $(140) million and $78 million. (d) Represents interest, lease and finance charges. (e) Represents management and advisory fees, and net investment income with respect to GICs. (f) Represents income before income taxes, minority interest, and cumulative effect of accounting changes. (g) Catastrophe losses were $3.28 billion, $1.16 billion and $83 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (h) Represents unallocated corporate expenses and other realized capital gains (losses) and includes the NYAG, DOI, SEC and DOJ settlement costs in 2005. (i) Includes $312 million and $96 million in catastrophe related losses from partially owned companies in 2005 and 2004, respectively, and approximately $1.6 billion of regulatory settlement charges in 2005. General Insurance AIGs General Insurance operations provide property and casualty products and services throughout the world. The decrease in General Insurance operating income in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to catastrophe related losses, increases in the reserve for losses and loss expenses and changes in estimates related to the remediation of AIGs material weakness in control over certain balance sheet reconciliations, partially offset by profitable growth in Foreign Generals underwriting results and DBGs and Foreign Generals net investment income. In addition, realized capital gains increased in 2005 compared to 2004. General Insurance operating income includes $2.89 billion, $1.05 billion and $83 million in catastrophe related losses in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. DBGs operating income included $197 million of additional losses in 2005 resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the 2004 Florida hurricanes. Life Insurance & Retirement Services AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations provide insurance, financial and investment products throughout the world. Foreign operations provided approximately 59 percent and 61 percent of AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income increased 12 percent in 2005 and 16 percent in 2004 when compared to 2003. Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income grew 8 percent in 2005. Realized capital gains included in operating income was $84 million in 2005 compared to $372 million in 2004 and $486 million in 2003. The decline in realized capital gains in 2005 includes the effect of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses under FAS 52. For 2005, the foreign Life & Retirement Service segment also incurred higher policy benefit costs for contributions to the participating policyholder fund in Singapore, totaling $137 million related to the settlement of a long disputed local tax issue. The domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment operating income grew by 17 percent in 2005. Realized capital losses included in operating income was $(302) million in 2005 compared to $(329) million in 2004 and $(246) million in 2003. The 2004 results include increased policy benefits of $178 million associated with the workers compensation arbitration with Superior National. The domestic Life Insurance & Retirement AIG Form 10 K 27 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Services segment also includes $12 million and $5 million in catastrophe related losses in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Financial Services AIGs Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets transactions, consumer finance and insurance premium financing. Financial Services operating income increased significantly in 2005 compared to 2004 and in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to the fluctuation in earnings resulting from not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. Offsetting this increase in 2004 when compared to 2003 is the effect of ILFCs disposition of approximately $2 billion in aircraft through securitizations in the third quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. Fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of Capital Markets operations and the effect of not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 for hedges on securities available for sale and borrowings. The increase in 2005 when compared to 2004 was partially offset by $62 million in catastrophe related losses in the Consumer Finance operations in 2005. The charge relating to the PNC settlement, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, had a significant negative effect on results in 2004. Consumer Finance operations increased revenues and operating income, both domestically and internationally. Asset Management AIGs Asset Management operations include institutional and retail asset management and broker dealer services and spread based investment business from the sale of GICs. These products and services are offered to individuals and institutions, both domestically and overseas. Asset Management operating income increased 6 percent in 2005 when compared to 2004 as a result of the upturn in worldwide financial markets and a strong global product portfolio; operating income also increased 61 percent in 2004 when compared to 2003 as a result of the same factors. Capital Resources At December 31, 2005, AIG had total consolidated shareholders equity of $86.32 billion and total consolidated borrowings of $109.85 billion. At that date, $99.42 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs), liabilities connected to trust preferred stock, or matched notes and bonds payable. During 2005, AIG repurchased in the open market 2,477,100 shares of its common stock. Liquidity At December 31, 2005, AIGs consolidated invested assets included $17.24 billion in cash and short term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2005 amounted to $25.14 billion. AIG believes that its liquid assets, cash provided by operations and access to short term funding through commercial paper and bank credit facilities will enable it to meet any anticipated cash requirements. Outlook From March through June of 2005, the major rating agencies downgraded AIGs ratings in a series of actions. S&P lowered the long term senior debt and counterparty ratings of AIG from AAA to AA and changed the rating outlook to negative. Moodys lowered AIGs long term senior debt rating from Aaa to Aa2 and changed the outlook to stable. Fitch downgraded the long term senior debt ratings of AIG from AAA to AA and placed the ratings on Rating Watch Negative. The agencies also took rating actions on AIGs insurance subsidiaries. S&P and Fitch lowered to AA+ the insurance financial strength ratings of most of AIGs insurance companies. Moodys lowered the insurance financial strength ratings generally to either Aa1 or Aa2. A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength ratings for most of AIGs insurance subsidiaries from A++ to A+ and the issuer credit ratings from aa+ to aa . Many of these companies ratings remain on a negative watch. In addition, S&P changed the outlook on ILFCs AA long term senior debt rating to negative. Moodys affirmed ILFCs long term and short term senior debt ratings (A1/P 1). Fitch downgraded ILFCs long term senior debt rating from AA to A+ and placed the rating on Rating Watch Negative and downgraded ILFCs short term debt rating from F1+ to F1. Fitch also placed the A+ long term senior debt ratings of American General Finance Corporation and American General Finance, Inc. on Rating Watch Negative. S&P and Moodys affirmed the long term and short term senior debt ratings of American General Finance Corporation at A+/A 1 and A1/P 1, respectively. These debt and financial strength ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG managements request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries. For a discussion of the effect of these ratings downgrades on AIGs businesses, see Risk Factors AIGs Credit Ratings in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Despite industry price erosion in some classes of general insurance, AIG expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new General Insurance businesses as a result of AIGs broad product line and extensive distribution networks. In December 2005, AIUO received a license from the government of Vietnam to operate a wholly owned general insurance company in Vietnam. This license, the first general insurance license granted by Vietnam to a U.S. based insurance organization, permits AIG to operate a general insurance company throughout Vietnam. In early 2006, AIG announced plans to acquire a leading general insurance company in Taiwan. 28 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES In China, AIG has wholly owned life insurance operations in eight cities. These operations should benefit from Chinas rapid rate of economic growth and growing middle class, a segment that is a prime market for life insurance. AIG believes that it may also have opportunities in the future to grow by entering the group insurance business. However, in March 2005 it withdrew its application to serve the group insurance market until certain regulatory issues are resolved. Among the regulatory issues to be addressed is the response to AIGs acknowledgment that certain of its Hong Kong based agents sold life insurance to customers on the Chinese mainland in contravention of applicable regulations. AIG Edison Life, acquired in August 2003, adds to the current agency force in Japan, and provides alternative distribution channels including banks, financial advisers, and corporate and government employee relationships. In January 2005, AIG Star Life entered into an agreement with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, one of Japans largest banks, to market a multi currency fixed annuity. Through ALICO, AIG Star Life and AIG Edison, AIG has developed a leadership position in the distribution of annuities through banks. AIG is also a leader in the direct marketing of insurance products through sponsors and in the broad market. AIG also expects continued growth in India, Korea and Vietnam. Domestically, AIG anticipates continued operating growth in 2006 as distribution channels are expanded and new products are introduced. The home service operation has not met business objectives, although its cash flow has been strong, and domestic group life/health continues to be weak. The home service operation is expected to be a slow growth business. AIG American Generals current ratings remain equal to or higher than many of its principal competitors. AIG American General competes with a variety of companies based on services and products, in addition to ratings. The recent rating actions appear to be having no negative long term effect on independent producer relationships or customer surrender activity. In the airline industry, changes in market conditions are not immediately apparent in operating results. Lease rates have firmed considerably, as a result of strong demand spurred by the recovering global commercial aviation market, especially in Asia. Sales have begun to increase, and AIG expects an increasing level of interest from a variety of purchasers. AIG also expects increased contributions to Financial Services revenues and income from its consumer finance operations overseas. However, the downgrades of AIGs credit ratings may adversely affect funding costs for AIG and its subsidiaries and AIGFPs ability to engage in derivative transactions and certain structured products. See Risk Factors AIGs Credit Ratings in Item 1A. Risk Factors. GICs, which are sold domestically and abroad to both institutions and individuals, are written on an opportunistic basis when market conditions are favorable. In September 2005, AIG launched a $10 billion matched investment program in the Euromarkets under which AIG debt securities will be issued. AIG also expects to launch a matched investment program in the domestic market which, along with the Euro program, will become AIGs principal spread based investment activity. However, the timing of the launch of the domestic program is uncertain. Because AIGs credit spreads in the capital markets have widened following the ratings declines, there may be a reduction in the earnings on new business in AIGs spread based funding businesses. AIG has many promising growth initiatives underway around the world. Cooperative agreements such as those with PICC and various banks in the U.S., Japan and Korea are expected to expand distribution networks for AIGs products and provide models for future growth. For a description of the risk factors that may affect these operations and initiatives, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Critical Accounting Estimates AIG considers its most critical accounting estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses, future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts, deferred policy acquisition costs, estimated gross profits for investment oriented products, fair value determinations for certain Capital Markets assets and liabilities, other than temporary declines in the value of investments and flight equipment recoverability. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIGs results of operations would be directly affected. Throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIGs critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail. The major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below. RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES (GENERAL INSURANCE): Loss trend factors: used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on premium rate adequacy and the projected loss ratio with respect to prior accident years. Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year: in this case, accident year 2005 for the year end 2005 loss reserve analysis. For low frequency, high severity classes such as excess casualty and D&O, expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years. Loss development factors: used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate amount. FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR LIFE AND ACCIDENT AND HEALTH CONTRACTS (LIFE INSURANCE & RETIREMENT SERVICES): Interest rates: which vary by geographical region, year of issuance and products. Mortality, morbidity and surrender rates: based upon actual experience by geographical region modified to allow for variation in policy form. AIG Form 10 K 29 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued ESTIMATED GROSS PROFITS (LIFE INSURANCE & RETIREMENT SERVICES): Estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated duration of the contracts (investment oriented products) affect the carrying value of deferred policy acquisition costs under FAS 97. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less required interest, actual mortality and other expenses. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS (LIFE INSURANCE & RETIREMENT SERVICES): Recoverability based on current and future expected profitability, which is affected by interest rates, foreign exchange rates, mortality experience, and policy persistency. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS (GENERAL INSURANCE): Recoverability and eligibility based upon the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (FINANCIAL SERVICES): Valuation models: utilizing factors, such as market liquidity and current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. Pricing data: AIG attempts to secure reliable and independent current market price data, such as published exchange rates from external subscription services such as Bloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in its models. When such prices are not available, AIG uses an internal methodology, which includes interpolation and extrapolation from verifiable prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of the transactions. OTHER THAN TEMPORARY DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS: Securities are considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment based upon the following criteria: Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par or amortized cost (if lower) for an extended period of time (nine months or longer). The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the debtor defaulting or seeking bankruptcy or insolvency protection or voluntary reorganization. The probability of non realization of a full recovery on its investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events. FLIGHT EQUIPMENT RECOVERABILITY (FINANCIAL SERVICES) Expected undiscounted future net cash flows: based upon current lease rates, projected future lease rates and estimated terminal values of each aircraft based on third party information. Operating Review General Insurance Operations AIGs General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance both domestically and abroad. See General Insurance Operations in Item 1. Business for more information relating to General Insurance subsidiaries. As previously noted, AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its investors. Accordingly, in its General Insurance business, AIG uses certain non GAAP measures, where AIG has determined these measurements to be useful and meaningful. A critical discipline of a successful general insurance business is the objective to produce operating income from underwriting exclusive of investment related income. When underwriting is not profitable, premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses and underwriting related expenses. In these situations, the addition of general insurance related investment income and realized capital gains may, however, enable a general insurance business to produce operating income. For these reasons, AIG views underwriting profit to be critical in the overall evaluation of performance. Although in and of itself not a GAAP measurement, AIG believes that underwriting profit is a useful and meaningful disclosure. See also the discussion under Liquidity herein. Underwriting profit is measured in two ways: statutory underwriting profit and GAAP underwriting profit. Statutory underwriting profit is derived by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred. Statutory accounting generally requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for statutory purposes, expenses are recognized immediately, not over the same period that the revenues are earned. GAAP accounting requires the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned, the accounting principle of matching. Therefore, to convert underwriting results to a GAAP basis, acquisition expenses are deferred (deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC)) and amortized over the period the related net premiums written are earned. Accordingly, the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by GAAP. DAC is reviewed for recoverability, and such review requires management judgment. See also Critical Accounting Estimates herein and Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. AIG, along with most General Insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses, respectively. The combined ratio presents the total 30 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES cost per $100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized in income as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios. General Insurance operating income is comprised of underwriting profit (loss), net investment income and realized capital gains and losses. These components, as well as net premiums written, net premiums earned and statutory ratios for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: (in millions, except ratios) 2005 2004 2003 Net premiums written: Domestic General DBG $ 23,128 $ 22,506 $ 19,563 Transatlantic 3,466 3,749 3,341 Personal Lines 4,653 4,354 3,732 Mortgage Guaranty 628 607 531 Foreign General 9,997 9,407 7,864 Total $ 41,872 $ 40,623 $ 35,031 Net premiums earned: Domestic General DBG $ 22,602 $ 21,215 $ 16,704 Transatlantic 3,385 3,661 3,171 Personal Lines 4,634 4,291 3,678 Mortgage Guaranty 533 539 496 Foreign General(f) 9,655 8,831 7,257 Total $ 40,809 $ 38,537 $ 31,306 Underwriting profit (loss)(a): Domestic General DBG $ (3,250 ) (b)(c) $ (1,340 ) $ 387 Transatlantic (420 ) (47 ) 109 Personal Lines (19 ) 160 183 Mortgage Guaranty 241 278 264 Foreign General(e)(f) 1,398 702 1,032 Total $ (2,050 ) (d) $ (247 ) $ 1,975 Net investment income: Domestic General DBG $ 2,403 $ 1,965 $ 1,433 Transatlantic 343 307 271 Personal Lines 217 186 152 Mortgage Guaranty 123 120 142 Intercompany adjustments and eliminations net 1 7 Foreign General 944 618 561 Total $ 4,031 $ 3,196 $ 2,566 Realized capital gains (losses) 334 228 (39 ) Operating income(a) $ 2,315 (b)(c)(d) $ 3,177 $ 4,502 Domestic General: Loss ratio 89.59 83.88 78.35 Expense ratio 21.00 19.21 17.25 Combined ratio 110.59 103.09 95.60 Foreign General: Loss ratio 53.66 61.61 55.52 Expense ratio(e) 31.90 29.20 27.82 Combined ratio(f) 85.56 90.81 83.34 Consolidated: Loss ratio 81.09 78.78 73.06 Expense ratio 23.60 21.52 19.62 Combined ratio(a) 104.69 100.30 92.68 (a) The effect of catastrophe related losses on the consolidated General Insurance combined ratio for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 7.06, 2.74 and 0.27, respectively.

(c) The 2005 operating loss for DBG includes $291 million of expenses related to changes in estimates for uncollectible reinsurance and other premium balances and $100 million of accrued expenses in connection with certain workers compensation insurance policies written between 1985 and 1996. See Note 12(i) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Includes the fourth quarter 2005 increase in net reserves of approximately $1.8 billion. (e) Includes the results of wholly owned AIU agencies. (f) Income statement accounts expressed in non functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. General Insurance Results General Insurance operating income in 2005 decreased after accounting for catastrophe related losses, the fourth quarter increase in reserves and changes in estimates related to remediation of the material weakness in reconciliation of balance sheet accounts. This decrease was partially offset by strong profitable growth in Foreign Generals underwriting results and DBGs and Foreign Generals net investment income. DBGs underwriting results also included additional losses incurred resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the 2004 Florida hurricanes. General Insurance operating income in 2004 showed positive results, even after accounting for catastrophe losses, the charge for asbestos and environmental exposures and the $232 million charge reflecting a change in estimate for salvage and subrogation recoveries. Net investment income and the capital gains realized in 2004 rather than the capital losses realized in 2003 also benefited General Insurance results. AIG Form 10 K 31 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued DBGs net premiums written increased modestly in 2005 when compared to 2004, reflecting generally improving renewal retention rates and a modest change in the mix of business towards smaller accounts for which DBG purchases less reinsurance. DBG also continued to expand its relationships with a larger number and broader range of brokers. Recently, DBG has seen improvement in domestic property rates as well as increases in submission activity in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes. DBG attributes the increase in submissions to its overall financial strength in comparison to many insurers that experienced significant losses and reductions of surplus as a result of the hurricanes. The DBG loss ratio increased in 2005 from 2004 principally as a result of adverse loss development, the third and fourth quarter 2005 catastrophe related losses and the $197 million of additional losses resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the 2004 hurricanes. The DBG expense ratio increased in 2005 from 2004 principally due to an increase in net commissions resulting from the replacement of certain ceded quota share reinsurance, for which DBG earns a ceding commission, with excess of loss reinsurance, which generally does not include a ceding commission. Increases in other underwriting expenses at DBG relate to the changes in estimates noted above, as well as unusually high expenses for Personal Lines. The Foreign General expense ratio increased in 2005 from 2004 principally because consumer lines of business, which have higher acquisition costs, have become more significant. Transatlantics net premiums written and net premiums earned for 2005 decreased compared to 2004, principally due to competitive market conditions and increased ceding company retentions in certain classes of business. The great majority of the premium decrease relates to Transatlantics domestic operations. Operating income decreased principally as a result of the increased level of catastrophe losses. Personal Lines net premiums written and net premiums earned for 2005 increased when compared to 2004 as a result of strong growth in the Private Client Group and Agency Auto divisions due to increased agent/broker appointments, greater penetration and enhanced product offerings. AIG direct premiums are down slightly from 2004 due to aggressive re underwriting of the previously acquired GE business and the discontinuation of underwriting homeowners business. Involuntary auto premiums were down in 2005 due to the decline in the assigned risk marketplace. Underwriting profit declined in 2005 as a result of hurricane losses and related expenses, reserve strengthening, an increase in Agency Autos current accident year physical damage loss ratio, and expenses incurred related to terminating AIGs relationship with The Robert Plan effective December 31, 2005. Mortgage Guaranty net premiums written were up slightly for 2005 when compared to 2004, reflecting growth in the second liens and international businesses offset by higher ceded premiums. Higher acquisition costs and lower earned premiums from certain single premium product lines resulted in lower underwriting profit in 2005 compared to 2004. UGC continued to achieve expansion of its international business in 2005. Foreign General Insurance had strong results in 2005. Growth in net premiums written for 2005 was achieved from new business as well as new distribution channels. In Japan, the purchase in February 2005 of the insurance portfolio of the Royal & SunAlliance branch operations opened new distribution channels. In the Far East, personal accident business exhibited strong growth and had excellent results for 2005. Commercial lines in Europe exhibited healthy growth and had positive results for 2005, partially offset by rate decreases in Australia and the United Kingdom. Personal lines operations in Brazil and Latin America continue to exhibit strong growth, which translated into improved underwriting results for 2005. The Lloyds Ascot syndicate continues to grow; however, insurance losses and reinstatement premium costs relating to the hurricanes caused a significant reduction in 2005 underwriting results. Foreign General Insurance also benefited from a decrease in the fourth quarter of 2005 in net reserves for loss and loss expense for non asbestos and environmental reserves. Approximately half of the Foreign General Insurance net premiums written is derived from commercial insurance and the remainder from consumer lines. AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of General Insurance net premiums written. 2005 Growth in original currency 2.6 % Foreign exchange effect 0.5 Growth as reported in U.S. dollars 3.1 % AIGs General Insurance results reflect the effects of catastrophe related losses of $2.89 billion, $1.05 billion and $83 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to year, making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult. With respect to catastrophe losses, AIG believes that it has taken appropriate steps, such as careful exposure selection and obtaining reinsurance coverage, to reduce the effect of the magnitude of possible future losses. The occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity, such as a terrorist attack, earthquake or hurricane, that causes insured losses, however, could have a material adverse effect on AIGs results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. General Insurance net investment income grew in 2005 when compared to 2004. AIG is benefiting from strong cash flow, higher interest rates and increased partnership income. Cash flow for Foreign General was lower in 2005 when compared to 2004 due to payments for catastrophe related losses incurred in 2005 and 2004 and for the purchase of the Royal & SunAlliance branch operations. Partnership income was particularly strong for Foreign General due to increases in market valuations of infrastructure fund investments in Africa, Asia, China, Eastern Europe and India. Additionally, net investment income was positively affected by the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. In 32 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2004, net investment income increased when compared to 2003. See also the discussion under Liquidity herein and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Realized capital gains and losses resulted from the ongoing investment management of the General Insurance portfolios within the overall objectives of the General Insurance operations. See the discussion on Valuation of Invested Assets herein. The contribution of General Insurance operating income to AIGs consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes was 15 percent in 2005, compared to 21 percent in 2004 and 38 percent in 2003. The decrease in contribution percentages in both 2005 and 2004 was largely the result of reserve increases and the effects of catastrophe losses. Reinsurance AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its General Insurance operations. AIG insures risks globally, and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. Reinsurance is an important risk management tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention at prudent levels set by management. AIG also purchases reinsurance to mitigate its catastrophic exposure. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs because one or more catastrophe losses could negatively affect AIGs reinsurers and result in an inability of AIG to collect reinsurance recoverables. AIGs reinsurance department evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of state of the art industry recognized program models among other techniques. AIG supplements these models through continually monitoring the risk exposure of AIGs worldwide General Insurance operations and adjusting such models accordingly. Although reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds, an efficient and effective reinsurance program substantially limits AIGs exposure to potentially significant losses. With respect to its property business, AIG has either renewed existing coverage or purchased new coverage that, in the opinion of management, is adequate to limit AIGs exposures. AIGs consolidated general reinsurance assets amounted to $23.59 billion at December 31, 2005 and resulted from AIGs reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 2005 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 2005, approximately 48 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers. Many of these balances were collateralized, permitting statutory recognition. Additionally, with the approval of its domiciliary insurance regulators, AIG posted approximately $1.5 billion of letters of credit issued by several commercial banks in favor of certain Domestic General Insurance companies to permit statutory recognition of balances otherwise uncollateralized at December 31, 2005. The remaining 52 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers. The terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories, not creditworthiness. At December 31, 2005, approximately 88 percent of the balances with respect to authorized reinsurers are from reinsurers rated A (excellent) or better, as rated by A.M. Best, or A (strong) or better, as rated by S&P. These ratings are measures of financial strength. AIG maintains a reserve for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. While AIG has been largely successful in its previous recovery efforts, at December 31, 2005, AIG had a reserve for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating $992 million. At that date, AIG had no significant reinsurance recoverables due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled (e.g., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction). AIGs Reinsurance Security Department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. Such assessments include, but are not limited to, identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity, and evaluating the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. This department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the requirements for credit risk mitigants. For example, in AIGs treaty reinsurance contracts, AIG includes provisions that frequently require a reinsurer to post collateral when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, AIG limits its unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers, which include, but are not limited to, insurer financial strength rating downgrades, policyholder surplus declines at or below a certain predetermined level or a certain predetermined level of a reinsurance recoverable being reached. In addition, AIGs Credit Risk Committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer. AIG enters into intercompany reinsurance transactions, primarily through AIRCO, for its General Insurance and Life Insurance operations. AIG enters into these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among AIGs various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. AIG generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain statutory recognition of these intercompany reinsurance transactions. At December 31, 2005, approximately $3.6 billion of letters of credit were outstanding to cover intercompany reinsurance transactions with AIRCO or other General Insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005, the consolidated general reinsurance assets of $23.59 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of $829 million and $19.69 bil AIG Form 10 K 33 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued lion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses, including ceded losses incurred but not reported (IBNR) (ceded reserves) and $3.07 billion of ceded reserve for unearned premiums. The ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments thereto are reflected in income currently. It is AIGs belief that the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2005 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded. Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses The table below classifies as of December 31, 2005 the components of the General Insurance gross reserve for losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) by major lines of business on a statutory Annual Statement basis*: (in millions) Other liability occurrence $ 18,116 Other liability claims made 12,447 Workers compensation 11,630 Auto liability 6,569 Property 7,217 International 4,939 Reinsurance 2,886 Medical malpractice 2,363 Aircraft 1,844 Products liability 1,937 Commercial multiple peril 1,359 Accident and health 1,678 Fidelity/ surety 1,072 Other 3,112 Total $ 77,169 * Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. AIGs reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development. At December 31, 2005, General Insurance net loss reserves were $57.5 billion, an increase of $10.22 billion from the prior year end. The net loss reserve increase includes the fourth quarter 2005 increase in net reserves of approximately $1.8 billion, comprised of $960 million for non asbestos and environmental exposures, and $873 million for asbestos and environmental exposures. The increase in non asbestos and environmental reserves includes an increase of $1.44 billion for DBG and decreases of $455 million for Foreign General Insurance and $29 million for Mortgage Guaranty. The DBG increase of $1.44 billion is $140 million greater than the amount previously announced in AIGs press release of February 9, 2006 as a result of an additional change in estimate related to a commuted reinsurance agreement. The aggregate increase in asbestos and environmental reserves includes increases of $706 million and $167 million, respectively, for DBG and Foreign General Insurance. As discussed in more detail below, the fourth quarter 2005 reserve increase was attributable to adverse development primarily related to 2002 and prior accident years, partially offset by favorable development for accident years 2003 through 2005. This reserve action reflects the completion of both the Milliman, Inc. (Milliman) review and AIGs own actuarial studies in the fourth quarter of 2005. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income. The table below classifies the components of the General Insurance net loss reserves by business unit as of December 31, 2005. (in millions) DBG(a) $ 40,782 Personal Lines(b) 2,578 Transatlantic 5,690 Mortgage Guaranty 340 Foreign General(c) 8,086 Total Net Loss Reserve $ 57,476 (a) DBG loss reserves include approximately $3.77 billion ($4.26 billion before discount) related to business written by DBG but ceded to AIRCO and reported in AIRCOs statutory filings. DBG loss reserves also include approximately $407 million related to business included in AIUOs statutory filings. (b) Personal Lines loss reserves include $878 million related to business ceded to DBG and reported in DBGs statutory filings. (c) Foreign General loss reserves include approximately $2.15 billion related to business reported in DBGs statutory filings. The DBG net loss reserve of $40.78 billion is comprised principally of the business of AIG subsidiaries participating in the American Home/ National Union pool (11 companies) and the surplus lines pool (Lexington, Starr Excess Liability Insurance Company and Landmark Insurance Company). Beginning in 1998, DBG ceded a quota share percentage of its other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business to AIRCO. The quota share percentage ceded was 40 percent in 1998, 65 percent in 1999, 75 percent in 2000 and 2001, 50 percent in 2002 and 2003, 40 percent in 2004 and 35 percent in 2005 and covered all business written in these years for these lines by participants in the American Home/National Union pool. In 1998 the cession reflected only the other liability occurrence business, but in 1999 and 34 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES subsequent years included products liability occurrence. AIRCOs loss reserves relating to these quota share cessions from DBG are recorded on a discounted basis. As of year end 2005, AIRCO carried a discount of approximately $490 million applicable to the $4.26 billion in undiscounted reserves it assumed from the American Home/National Union pool via this quota share cession. AIRCO also carries approximately $440 million in net loss reserves relating to Foreign General insurance business. These reserves are carried on an undiscounted basis. Beginning in 1997, the Personal Lines division ceded a percentage of all business written by the companies participating in the personal lines pool to the American Home/National Union pool. As noted above, the total reserves carried by participants in the American Home/National Union pool relating to this cession amounted to $878 million as of year end 2005. The companies participating in the American Home/National Union pool have maintained a participation in the business written by AIU for decades. As of year end 2005, these AIU reserves carried by participants in the American Home/National Union pool amounted to approximately $2.15 billion. The remaining Foreign General reserves are carried by AIUO, AIRCO, and other smaller AIG subsidiaries domiciled outside the United States. Statutory filings in the U.S. by AIG companies reflect all the business written by U.S. domiciled entities only, and therefore exclude business written by AIUO, AIRCO, and all other internationally domiciled subsidiaries. The total reserves carried at year end 2005 by AIUO and AIRCO were approximately $3.72 billion and $4.21 billion, respectively. AIRCOs $4.21 billion in total general insurance reserves consist of approximately $3.77 billion from business assumed from the American Home/National Union pool and an additional $440 million relating to Foreign General Insurance business. Discounting of Reserves At December 31, 2005, AIGs overall General Insurance net loss reserves reflects a loss reserve discount of $2.11 billion, including tabular and non tabular calculations. The tabular workers compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979 81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non tabular workers compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities ranging from one to twenty years and the companys own payout pattern, with the future expected payment for each year using the interest rate associated with the corresponding Treasury security yield for that time period. The discount is comprised of the following: $512 million tabular discount for workers compensation in DBG; $1.11 billion non tabular discount for workers compensation in DBG; and, $490 million non tabular discount for other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence in AIRCO. The total undiscounted workers compensation loss reserve carried by DBG is approximately $9.5 billion as of year end 2005. The other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business in AIRCO that is assumed from DBG is discounted based on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities ranging from one to twenty years and the DBG payout pattern for this business. The undiscounted reserves assumed by AIRCO from DBG totaled approximately $4.26 billion at December 31, 2005. Results of 2005 Reserving Process It is managements belief that the General Insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover General Insurance net losses and loss expenses as of December 31, 2005. While AIG annually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIGs ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIGs loss reserves as of December 31, 2005. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIGs consolidated financial position, although it could have a material adverse effect on AIGs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. See Risk Factors Casualty Insurance and Underwriting Reserves in Item 1A. Risk Factors. As part of the 2005 year end actuarial loss reserve analysis, AIG expanded its review processes and conducted additional studies. In addition, in August 2005, AIG commissioned Milliman to provide an independent, comprehensive review of the loss reserves of AIGs principal property casualty insurance operations, including an independent ground up study of AIGs asbestos and environmental exposures. The Milliman review encompassed nearly all of AIGs carried loss reserves, other than those pertaining to the operations of Transatlantic and 21st Century. AIGs management carefully considered the analyses provided by its actuarial staff and by Milliman for each class of business in determining AIGs best estimate of its loss reserves. AIG Form 10 K 35 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued The table below presents the reconciliation of net loss reserves for 2005, 2004 and 2003 as follows: (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net reserve for losses and loss expenses at beginning of year $ 47,254 $ 36,228 $ 29,347 Foreign exchange effect (628 ) 524 580 Acquisition 391 (a) Losses and loss expenses incurred: Current year 28,426 26,793 20,509 Prior years(b) 4,665 (c) 3,564 (d) 2,363 Losses and loss expenses incurred 33,091 30,357 22,872 Losses and loss expenses paid: Current year 7,331 7,692 6,187 Prior years 14,910 12,163 10,775 Losses and loss expenses paid 22,241 19,855 16,962 Net reserve for losses and loss expenses at end of year $ 57,476 $ 47,254 $ 36,228 (a) Reflects the opening balances with respect to the GE U.S. based auto and home insurance business acquired in 2003. (b) Includes accretion of discount of $(15) million in 2005, including an increase of $375 million in the discount recorded in 2005; $377 million in 2004 and $296 million in 2003. Additionally, includes $269 million in 2005, $317 million in 2004 and $323 million in 2003 for the general reinsurance operations of Transatlantic, and $197 million of additional losses incurred in 2005 resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the 2004 Florida hurricanes. (c) Includes fourth quarter charge of $1.8 billion. (d) Includes fourth quarter charge of $850 million attributable to the change in estimate for asbestos and environmental exposures. For 2005, AIGs overall net loss reserve development from prior accident years was an increase of approximately $4.67 billion, including approximately $269 million from the general reinsurance operations of Transatlantic. This $4.67 billion adverse development in 2005 was comprised of approximately $8.60 billion for 2002 and prior accident years, partially offset by favorable development for accident years 2003 and 2004 for most lines of business, with the notable exception being D&O. The adverse loss development for 2002 and prior accident years is attributable to approximately $4.0 billion of development from D&O and related management liability classes of business, excess casualty, and excess workers compensation, and to approximately $873 million of development from asbestos and environmental claims. The remaining portion of the adverse development for 2002 and prior accident years includes approximately $520 million related to Transatlantic with the balance spread across many other lines of business. The largest contributors to the $4.67 billion net adverse loss development were: D&O and related management liability classes of business: The adverse development for 2002 and prior accident years totalled approximately $1.7 billion, principally related to 2002 and prior accident years. This adverse development resulted from significant loss cost escalation due to a variety of factors, including the following: the increase in frequency and severity of corporate bankruptcies; the increase in frequency of financial statement restatements; the sharp rise in market capitalization of publicly traded companies and the increase in the number of initial public offerings, which led to an unprecedented number of IPO allocation/laddering suits in 2001. In addition, the extensive utilization of multi year policies during this period limited AIGs ability to respond to emerging trends as rapidly as would otherwise be the case. AIG has experienced significant adverse loss development since 2002 as a result of these issues. AIG has taken numerous actions in response to this development, including rate increases and policy form and coverage changes to better contain future loss costs in this class of business. AIGs 2005 year end actuarial reserve analyses for DBG exposures reflected several other noteworthy additional considerations and studies. AIGs claims staff conducted a series of ground up claim projections covering all open claims for this class of business through accident year 2004. Given the adverse development observed for this class of business in recent years, for year end 2005 AIG believed its reserves for this class were better estimated by benchmarking the actuarial indications to these claim projections. Excess Casualty: The adverse development for prior years was approximately $1.3 billion related to 2001 and prior accident years. This adverse development resulted from significant loss cost increases due to both frequency and severity of claims. The primary drivers of the increasing loss costs were medical inflation, which increased the economic loss component of tort claims; advances in medical care, which extended the life span of severely injured workers; and larger jury verdicts, which increased the value of severe tort claims. An additional factor affecting AIGs excess casualty experience in recent years has been the accelerated exhaustion of underlying primary policies for homebuilders. This has led to increasing construction defect related claim activity on AIGs excess policies. As noted above for D&O, many excess casualty policies were written on a multi year basis in the late 1990s, which limited AIGs ability to respond to emerging trends as rapidly as would otherwise be the case. AIG responded to these emerging trends by increasing rates and effecting numerous policy form and coverage changes. This led to a significant improvement in experience beginning with accident year 2001. In response to the continuing loss development, AIG increased further the loss development factors for this class of business in its 2005 year end actuarial reserve analysis. In addition, to more accurately estimate losses for construction defects, a separate review was performed by AIG claims staff for accounts with significant exposure to these claims. Excess Workers Compensation: The adverse development for prior years was approximately $1 billion related to 2002 and prior accident years. This adverse development resulted from significant loss cost increases, primarily attributable to rapidly increasing medical inflation and advances in medical care, which increased the cost of covered medical care and extended the life span of severely injured workers. The effect of these factors on excess workers compensation claims experience is leveraged, as frequency is increased by the rising number of claims that reach the excess layers. 36 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES In response to the continuing loss development, an additional study was conducted for the 2005 year end actuarial reserve analysis for DBG pertaining to the selection of loss development factors for this class of business. Claims for excess workers compensation exhibit an exceptionally long tail of loss development, running for decades from the date the loss is incurred. Thus, the adequacy of loss reserves for this class is sensitive to the estimated loss development factors, as such factors may be applied to many years of loss experience. In order to better estimate the tail development for this class, AIG claims staff conducted a claim by claim projection of the expected ultimate paid loss for each open claim for 1998 and prior accident years as these are the primary years that drive the tail factors. The objective of the study was to provide a benchmark against which loss development factors in the tail could be evaluated. For a discussion of the adverse development in asbestos and environmental exposures, see Asbestos and Environmental Reserves below. The favorable development in 2005 referred to above was principally the result of the following: Most classes of business, with the notable exception of D&O, experienced favorable loss development for accident year 2003, and nearly all classes experienced favorable development for accident year 2004. These accident years are benefiting from the actions AIG has taken in response to the significant improvement in market conditions that occurred beginning in 2001 and that accelerated thereafter. Rates increased sharply for most classes of business, and policy terms and conditions were also improved significantly. In connection with AIGs 2005 year end actuarial reserve analysis and after considering the results of the Milliman review, AIG has recognized the improving results to the extent they are credible, evidenced by up to five years of favorable loss experience across many lines of business since the market conditions improved. In addition, AIG has taken this information into consideration in determining the expected loss ratios for the 2005 accident year. Overview of Loss Reserving Process The General Insurance loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. One group is long tail casualty lines of business which include excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers compensation, general liability, products liability, and related classes. The other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines, personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines. Short Tail Reserves For operations writing short tail coverages, such as property coverages, the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes is geared toward maintaining an appropriate reserve level for the outstanding exposure, rather than determining an expected loss ratio for current business. For example, the IBNR reserve required for a class of property business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest years earned premiums, and this level of reserve would generally be maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in the current quarter. The 20 percent factor is adjusted to reflect changes in rate levels, loss reporting patterns, known exposures to large unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular class of business. Long Tail Reserves Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. Experience in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses because a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. Therefore, IBNR would constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses. AIGs carried net long tail loss reserves are tested using loss trend factors that AIG considers most appropriate for each class of business. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions is normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximated five percent. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms; current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs recognized. A number of actuarial assumptions are made in the review of reserves for each line of business. For longer tail lines of business, actuarial assumptions generally are made with respect to the following: Loss trend factors which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years. Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2005 for the year end 2005 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases, for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss trend (see above) and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors. For low frequency, high severity classes such as excess casualty and D&O, expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years. Loss development factors which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. AIG records quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of its many General Insurance profit centers. The overall change in AIGs loss reserves is based on the sum of these profit center level changes. For most profit centers which write longer tail classes of casualty coverage, the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes involves determining the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage. This loss ratio is multiplied by the current quarters net earned premium for that AIG Form 10 K 37 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued class of coverage to determine the quarters total estimated net incurred loss and loss expense. The change in loss reserves for the quarter for each class is thus the difference between the net incurred loss and loss expense, estimated as described above, and the net paid losses and loss expenses in the quarter. Details of the Loss Reserving Process The process of determining the current loss ratio for each class or business segment is based on a variety of factors. These include, but are not limited to, the following considerations: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; actual and anticipated rate changes; actual and anticipated changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business; actual and anticipated changes in external factors affecting results, such as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment. Each profit centers current loss ratio reflects input from actuarial, profit center and claims staff and is intended to represent managements best estimate of the current loss ratio after reflecting all of the factors described above. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios based thereon remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and changes in certain other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio for current business would be changed to reflect the revised assumptions. A comprehensive annual loss reserve review is conducted in the fourth quarter of each year for each AIG General Insurance subsidiary. These reviews are conducted in full detail for each class or line of business for each subsidiary, and thus consist of literally hundreds of individual analyses. The purpose of these reviews is to confirm the appropriateness of the reserves carried by each of the individual subsidiaries, and thereby of AIGs overall carried reserves. The reserve analysis for each business class is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business. In completing these detailed actuarial reserve analyses, the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions, including for example the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial method(s) to employ for each business class. Additionally, they must determine the appropriate segmentation of data or segments from which the adequacy of the reserves can be most accurately tested. In the course of these detailed reserve reviews for each business segment, a point estimate of the loss reserve is generally determined. The sum of these point estimates for each of the individual business classes for each subsidiary provides an overall actuarial point estimate of the loss reserve for that subsidiary. The ultimate process by which the actual carried reserves are determined considers not only the actuarial point estimate but a myriad of other factors. Other crucial internal and external factors considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions in the United States and abroad, changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environments, underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions, and claims handling. Loss reserve development can also be affected by commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance agreements. AIGs annual loss reserve review does not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates. Because a large portion of the loss reserves from AIGs General Insurance business relates to long tail casualty lines driven by severity rather than frequency of claims, such as excess casualty and D&O, developing a range around loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful. An estimate is calculated which AIGs actuaries believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve. This amount is then evaluated against actual carried reserves. Volatility of Reserve Estimates and Sensitivity Analyses There is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves, particularly for long tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty, when actual costs differ from the assumptions used to test the reserves. Such assumptions include those made for loss trend factors and loss development factors, as described earlier. Set forth below is a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the estimated effect on the loss reserve position of alternative loss trend or loss development factor assumptions as compared to those actually used to test the carried reserves. For the excess casualty class of business the assumed loss cost trend was approximately six percent. A five percent change in the assumed loss cost trend from each accident year to the next would cause approximately a $600 million change (either positively or negatively) to the net loss and loss expense reserve for this business. For the D&O and related management liability classes of business the assumed loss cost trend was four percent. A five percent change in this assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a $300 million change (either positively or negatively) to the net loss and loss expense reserve for such business. The effect of the loss trend assumption for the D&O class decreased in 2005 as a result of AIGs change in methodology, as described above, whereby claim projections through accident year 2004 are utilized as a benchmark for the actuarial indications. For the excess workers compensation class of business, loss costs were trended at six percent per annum. A five percent change in the assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a $250 million change (either positively or negatively) to the loss and loss expense reserve for this class. Actual loss cost trends in the early 1990s were negative for these classes, whereas in the late 1990s loss costs trends ran well into the double digits for each of these three classes. The sharp increase in loss costs in the late 1990s was thus much greater than the five percent changes cited above, and caused significant increases in the overall loss reserve needs for these classes. While changes in the loss cost trend assumptions can have a significant effect on the reserve needs for other smaller classes of liability business, the potential effect of these changes on AIGs overall carried reserves would be much less than for the classes noted above. For the excess casualty class, if future loss development factors differed by five percent from those utilized in the year end 2005 loss reserve review, there would be approximately a 38 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES $400 million change (either positively or negatively) to the overall AIG loss reserve position. The comparable effect on the D&O and related management liability classes would be approximately $200 million (either positively or negatively) if future loss development factors differed by five percent from those utilized in the year end 2005 loss reserve review. For the excess workers compensation class, the effect would be approximately $150 million (either positively or negatively). For workers compensation reserves, other than excess workers compensation reserves, the effect of a five percent deviation from the loss development factors utilized in the year end 2005 reserve reviews would be approximately $1.0 billion (either positively or negatively). Because loss development factors for this class have shown less volatility than higher severity classes such as excess casualty, however, actual changes in loss development factors are expected to be less than five percent. There is some degree of volatility in loss development patterns for other longer tail liability classes as well. However, the potential effect on AIGs reserves would be much less than for the classes cited above. The calculations of the effect of the five percent change in loss development factors are made by selecting the stage of accident year development where it is believed reasonable for such a deviation to occur. For example, for workers compensation, the $1.0 billion amount is calculated by assuming that each of the most recent eight accident years develop five percent higher than estimated by the current loss development factors utilized in the reserve study, i.e. the factor 1.05 is multiplied by the incurred losses (including IBNR and loss expenses) for these accident years. AIG management believes that using a five percent change in the assumptions for loss cost trends and loss development factors provides a reasonable benchmark for a sensitivity analysis of the reserves of AIGs most significant lines of general insurance business. For excess casualty business, both the loss cost trend and the loss development factor assumptions are critical. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past. Moreover, as excess casualty is a long tail class of business, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in the loss cost trends or loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic phenomena affecting claims. For example, during the lengthy periods during which losses develop for excess casualty, actual changes in loss costs from one accident year to the next have ranged from negative values to double digit amounts. Thus, there is the potential for significant volatility in loss costs for excess casualty and, although five percent is considered a reasonable benchmark for sensitivity analysis for this business, there is the potential for variations far greater than this amount (either positively or negatively). Likewise, in the judgment of AIGs actuaries, five percent is considered an appropriate benchmark for sensitivity analysis with respect to the loss development factor assumptions used to test the reserves. For D&O and related management liability classes of business, the loss cost trend assumption has been critical in past analyses, however, because of the utilization of claim projections for all claims through accident year 2004, as described above, the sensitivity of the reserves to this assumption has been reduced in 2005. The loss development factor assumption is important but less critical than for excess casualty. As this coverage is written on a claims made basis, claims for a given accident year are all reported within that year. Actual changes in loss costs from one accident year to the next in the 1990s ranged from double digit negative values for several accident years in the early 1990s to nearly 50 percent per year for the period from accident year 1996 to accident year 1999. Thus, there is the potential for extreme volatility in loss costs for this business and, although five percent is considered a reasonable benchmark for sensitivity analysis, there is the potential for variations far greater than this amount (either positively or negatively). Five percent is also considered an appropriate benchmark for sensitivity analysis with respect to the loss development factor assumptions used to test the reserves for these classes. However, as noted above, the effect of such a deviation is less than that of a similar deviation in loss cost trends. For the excess workers compensation class, the loss development factor assumptions are critical and the loss trend assumption is important but not as critical. Excess workers compensation is an extremely long tail class of business, hence there is a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. As noted above, the effect of a five percent change in the loss development factor is approximately $150 million. It would not be uncommon for the loss development factors to deviate by greater than five percent for this class of business. For workers compensation, the loss development factor assumptions are important. Generally, AIGs actual historical workers compensation loss development would be expected to provide a reasonably accurate predictor of future loss development. A five percent sensitivity indicator for workers compensation would thus be considered to be toward the high end of potential deviations for this class of business. The loss cost trend assumption for workers compensation is not believed to be material with respect to AIGs loss reserves. This is primarily because AIGs actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident years reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for workers compensation business. For casualty business other than the classes noted above, there is generally some potential for deviation in both the loss cost trend and loss development factor selections. However, the effect of such deviations would not be material when compared to the effect on the classes cited above. AIG Form 10 K 39 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Asbestos and Environmental Reserves The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented. However, AIG currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and has excluded such claims from the analysis herein. The majority of AIGs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case basis. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a subjective process and reserves for asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated using conventional reserving techniques such as those that rely on historical accident year loss development factors. Significant factors which affect the trends that influence the asbestos and environmental claims estimation process are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving, and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposures for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties. Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as with other types of claims. Such future development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage and liability issues. If the asbestos and environmental reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse effect on AIGs future results of operations. AIG does not discount asbestos and environmental reserves. With respect to known asbestos and environmental claims, AIG established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and environmental claims units, which investigate and adjust all such asbestos and environmental claims. These units evaluate these asbestos and environmental claims utilizing a claim by claim approach that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures. Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, AIG generally evaluates exposure on a policy by policy basis, considering a variety of factors such as known facts, current law, jurisdiction, policy language and other factors that are unique to each policy. Quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management judgment. Each claim is reviewed at least semi annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information. In both the specialized and dedicated asbestos and environmental claims units, AIG actively manages and pursues early resolution with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate its exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. AIG attempts to mitigate its known long tail environmental exposures by utilizing a combination of proactive claim resolution techniques including policy buybacks, complete environmental releases, compromise settlements, and, where indicated, litigation. With respect to asbestos claims handling, AIGs specialized claims staff operates to mitigate losses through proactive handling, supervision and resolution of asbestos cases. Thus, while AIG has resolved all claims with respect to miners and major manufacturers (Tier One), its claims staff continues to operate under the same proactive philosophy to resolve claims involving accounts with products containing asbestos (Tier Two), products containing small amounts of asbestos, companies in the distribution process, and parties with remote, ill defined involvement in asbestos (Tiers Three and Four). Through its commitment to appropriate staffing, training, and management oversight of asbestos cases, AIG mitigates to the extent possible its exposure to these claims. To determine the appropriate loss reserve as of December 31, 2005 for its asbestos and environmental exposures, AIG performed a series of top down and ground up reserve analyses. In order to ensure it had the most comprehensive analysis possible, AIG engaged Milliman to provide an analysis of these exposures including ground up estimates for both asbestos reserves and environmental reserves. Prior to 2005, AIGs reserve analyses for asbestos and environmental exposures was focused around a report year projection of aggregate losses for both asbestos and environmental reserves. Additional tests such as market share analyses were also performed. Ground up analyses such as those provided by Milliman take into account policyholder specific and claim specific information that has been gathered over many years from a variety of sources. Ground up studies can thus more accurately assess the exposure to AIGs layers of coverage for each policyholder, and hence 40 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES for all policyholders in the aggregate provided a sufficient sample of the policyholders can be modeled in this manner. In order to ensure its ground up analysis was as comprehensive as possible, AIG staff produced the information required at policy and claim level detail for nearly 1,000 asbestos defendants and over 1,100 environmental defendants. This represented nearly 90 percent of all accounts for which AIG had received any claim notice of any amount pertaining to asbestos or environmental exposure. AIG did not set any minimum thresholds such as amount of case reserve outstanding, or paid losses to date, that would have served to reduce the sample size and hence the comprehensiveness of the ground up analysis. The results of the ground up analysis for each significant account were examined by AIGs claims staff for reasonableness, for consistency with policy coverage terms, and any claim settlement terms applicable. Adjustments were incorporated accordingly. The results from the universe of modeled accounts, which as noted above reflects the vast majority of AIGs known exposures, were then utilized to estimate the ultimate losses from accounts that could not be modeled and to determine the appropriate provision for all unreported claims. AIG conducted a comprehensive analysis of reinsurance recoverability to establish the appropriate asbestos and environmental reserve net of reinsurance. AIG determined the amount of reinsurance that would be ceded to insolvent reinsurers or to commuted reinsurance contracts for both reported claims and for IBNR. These amounts were then deducted from the indicated amount of reinsurance recoverable. AIG also completed a top down report year projection of its indicated asbestos and environmental loss reserves. These projections consist of a series of tests performed separately for asbestos and for environmental exposures. For asbestos, these tests project the expected losses to be reported over the next twenty years, i.e., from 2006 through 2025, based on the actual losses reported through 2005 and the expected future loss emergence for these claims. Three scenarios were tested, with a series of assumptions ranging from more optimistic to more conservative. In the first scenario, all carried asbestos case reserves are assumed to be within ten percent of their ultimate settlement value. The second scenario relies on an actuarial projection of report year development for asbestos claims reported from 1993 to the present to estimate case reserve adequacy as of year end 2005. The third scenario relies on an actuarial projection of report year claims for asbestos but reflects claims reported from 1989 to the present to estimate case reserve adequacy as of year end 2005. Based on the results of the prior report years for each of the three scenarios described above, the report year approach then projects forward to the year 2025 the expected future report year losses, based on AIGs estimate of reasonable loss trend assumptions. These calculations are performed on losses gross of reinsurance. The IBNR (including a provision for development of reported claims) on a net basis is based on applying a factor reflecting the expected ratio of net losses to gross losses for future loss emergence. For environmental claims, an analogous series of frequency/ severity tests are produced. Environmental claims from future report years, (i.e., IBNR) are projected out ten years, i.e., through the year 2015. At year end 2005, AIG considered a number of factors and recent experience, in addition to the results of the respective top down and ground up analyses performed for asbestos and environmental reserves. Among the factors considered by AIG was the continued deterioration in its asbestos report year experience. The indication from the third scenario as described above for asbestos was approximately $265 million greater than AIGs carried net asbestos reserve, prior to its increase in the fourth quarter of 2005. This marks a continuation of the trend of adverse report year development for asbestos that has been observed for the past several years. AIG also noted its asbestos paid losses in 2005 increased from 2004s levels. AIG considered the significant uncertainty that remains as to AIGs ultimate liability relating to asbestos and environmental claims. This uncertainty is due to several factors including: The long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims; The increase in the volume of claims by currently unimpaired plaintiffs; Claims filed under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies; The number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection and the effect of prepackaged bankruptcies; Diverging legal interpretations; and With respect to environmental claims, the difficulty in estimating the allocation of remediation cost among various parties. After carefully considering the results of the ground up analysis, which AIG now plans to update on an annual basis, as well as all of the above factors including the recent report year experience, AIG determined its best estimate was to recognize an increase of $843 million in its carried net asbestos reserves, and an increase of $30 million in its carried net environmental reserves at December 31, 2005. The corresponding increases in gross reserves were approximately $1.97 billion for asbestos and $56 million for environmental. AIG Form 10 K 41 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued A summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 follows: 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos: Reserve for losses and loss expenses at beginning of year $ 2,559 $ 1,060 $ 1,235 $ 386 $ 1,304 $ 400 Losses and loss expenses incurred* 2,207 (a) 903 (a) 1,595 (a) 772 (a) 175 43 Losses and loss expenses paid* (325 ) (123 ) (271 ) (98 ) (244 ) (57 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses at end of year $ 4,441 $ 1,840 $ 2,559 $ 1,060 $ 1,235 $ 386 Environmental: Reserve for losses and loss expenses at beginning of year $ 974 $ 451 $ 789 $ 283 $ 832 $ 296 Losses and loss expenses incurred* 47 (b) 27 (b) 314 (b) 234 (b) 133 52 Losses and loss expenses paid* (95 ) (68 ) (129 ) (66 ) (176 ) (65 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses at end of year $ 926 $ 410 $ 974 $ 451 $ 789 $ 283 Combined: Reserve for losses and loss expenses at beginning of year $ 3,533 $ 1,511 $ 2,024 $ 669 $ 2,136 $ 696 Losses and loss expenses incurred* 2,254 (c) 930 (c) 1,909 (c) 1,006 (c) 308 95 Losses and loss expenses paid* (420 ) (191 ) (400 ) (164 ) (420 ) (122 ) Reserve for losses and loss expenses at end of year $ 5,367 $ 2,250 $ 3,533 $ 1,511 $ 2,024 $ 669 * All amounts pertain to policies underwritten in prior years. (a) Includes increases to gross losses and loss expense reserves of $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and increases to net losses and loss expense reserves of $843 million and $650 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. (b) Includes increases to gross losses and loss expense reserves of $56 million and $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and increases to net losses and loss expense reserves of $30 million and $200 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. (c) Includes increases to gross losses and loss expense reserves of $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and increases to net losses and loss expense reserves of $873 million and $850 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. The gross and net IBNR included in the reserve for losses and loss expenses, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined, at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were estimated as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos $ 3,401 $ 1,465 $ 2,033 $ 876 $ 695 $ 200 Environmental 586 266 606 284 347 80 Combined $ 3,987 $ 1,731 $ 2,639 $ 1,160 $ 1,042 $ 280 A summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Asbestos Environmental Combined Asbestos Environmental Combined Asbestos Environmental Combined Claims at beginning of year 7,575 8,216 15,791 7,474 8,852 16,326 7,085 8,995 16,080 Claims during year: Opened 854 5,253 * 6,107 909 2,592 3,501 669 2,106 2,775 Settled (67 ) (219 ) (286 ) (100 ) (279 ) (379 ) (86 ) (244 ) (330 ) Dismissed or otherwise resolved (1,069 ) (3,377 ) (4,446 ) (708 ) (2,949 ) (3,657 ) (194 ) (2,005 ) (2,199 ) Claims at end of year 7,293 9,873 17,166 7,575 8,216 15,791 7,474 8,852 16,326 * The opened claims count increased substantially during 2005 because a court ruling led AIG to report separate opened claims for previously pending cases relating to alleged MTBE exposures that AIG previously had counted in the aggregate as only a single claim on the assumption that the cases would be consolidated into a single federal court proceeding. The table below presents AIGs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for year end 2005, 2004 and 2003. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the year end carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Thus, caution should be 42 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio. AIGs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment. These ratios for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: Gross Net 2005 Survival ratios: Asbestos 15.9 19.8 Environmental 6.9 6.2 Combined 13.0 14.2 2004 Survival ratios: Asbestos 10.7 13.5 Environmental 6.5 6.8 Combined 9.1 10.5 2003 Survival ratios: Asbestos 4.7 4.5 Environmental 4.7 4.1 Combined 4.7 4.3 Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries offer a wide range of insurance and retirement savings products both domestically and abroad. Insurance oriented products consist of individual and group life, payout annuities, endowment and accident and health policies. Retirement savings products consist generally of fixed and variable annuities. See also Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Domestically, AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations offer a broad range of protection products, including life insurance, group life and health products, including disability income products and payout annuities, which include single premium immediate annuities, structured settlements and terminal funding annuities. Home service operations include an array of life insurance, accident and health and annuity products sold through career agents. In addition, home service includes a small block of run off property and casualty coverage. Retirement services include group retirement products, individual fixed and variable annuities sold through banks, broker dealers and exclusive sales representatives, and annuity runoff operations which include previously acquired closed blocks and other fixed and variable annuities largely sold through distribution relationships that have been discontinued. Overseas, AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations include insurance and investment oriented products such as whole and term life, investment linked, universal life and endowments, personal accident and health products, group products including pension, life and health, and fixed and variable annuities.

AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries report their operations through the following operating units: Domestic Life AIG American General, including American General Life Insurance Company (AG Life), USLIFE and AGLA; Domestic Retirement Services VALIC, AIG Annuity and AIG SunAmerica; Foreign Life ALICO, AIRCO, AIG Edison Life, AIG Star Life, AIA, Nan Shan and Philamlife. Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results The increase in operating income in 2005 compared to 2004 was caused by growth in both domestic and overseas operations. Similarly, the increase in operating income in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to strong growth, particularly overseas. Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums grew in 2005 when compared with 2004 as well as 2004 when compared with 2003. AIGs Domestic Life operations had continued growth in term and universal life sales with good performance from the independent distribution channels. GAAP premiums for life insurance grew 12 percent in 2005 reflecting consistently strong sales from the independent distribution channels. Retail periodic life sales increased 18 percent in 2005, representing a compound rate of growth of 16 percent since 2001, compared to modest growth in the industry. Profit margins have been maintained through strict underwriting discipline and low cost. In addition, increases in product prices and retention have offset price increases by reinsurers. Payout annuities declined slightly due to the low interest rate environment and the competitive market conditions for structured settlement and single premium individual annuity business. The domestic group business is below AIGs growth standards, largely because several accounts where pricing was unacceptable were not renewed and loss experience was higher than anticipated. Restructuring efforts in this business are focused on new product introductions, cross selling and other growth strategies. AGLA, the home service business, is diversifying product offerings, enhancing the capabilities and quality of the sales force, and broadening the markets served beyond those historically serviced in an effort to accelerate growth, although it is expected to remain a slow growth business. Domestic Retirement Services businesses faced a challenging environment in 2005 and 2004, as deposits declined approximately 17 percent for 2005 compared to 2004 and 1 percent for 2004 compared to 2003. The decrease in AIGs individual variable annuity product sales in 2005 was largely attributable to significant variable annuity sales declines at several of AIGs largest distribution firms due to lackluster equity markets, more 44 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES intense industry competition with regard to living benefit product features and heightened compliance procedures over selling practices. AIGs introduction of more competitive guaranteed minimum withdrawal features was delayed until late in the fourth quarter due to filing delays associated with the Restatements. During 2005, the interest yield curve flattened and, as a result, competing bank products such as certificates of deposit and other money market instruments with shorter durations than AIGs individual fixed annuity products became more attractive. The following table reflects deposit amounts for Domestic Retirement Services: Domestic Retirement Services Deposits December 31, (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Group retirement products* $ 6,436 $ 6,502 $ 5,918 Individual fixed annuities 7,337 9,947 11,384 Individual variable annuities 3,319 4,126 3,412 Individual fixed annuities runoff 200 253 350 Total $ 17,292 $ 20,828 $ 21,064 * Includes mutual funds. In 2005, AIG experienced a significant increase in surrender rates in all product lines. Group retirement products experienced higher surrenders as the average participant age increased and a greater percentage of these participants are near retirement age and or termination of service from their employers. Individual fixed annuities surrender rates are higher in 2005 primarily due to the shape of the interest yield curve and the general aging of the in force reserves. However, less than 20 percent of the individual fixed annuity reserves are available to surrender without charge. The increase in individual variable annuity surrender rates primarily reflects the higher shock lapse that occurred following expiration of the surrender charge period on certain 3 year and 7 year contracts (including a large closed block of acquired business). Reflecting a widespread industry phenomenon, this lapse rate, much of which was anticipated when the products were issued, has recently been affected by investor demand to exchange existing policies for new generation contracts with living benefits or lower fees. In addition, partial withdrawals on certain variable annuity products have increased as AIG has introduced features designed to generate a stream of income to the participants. The following chart shows the amount of reserves by surrender charge category as of December 31, 2005. Domestic Retirement Services Reserves Subject to Surrender Charges Group Individual Individual Retirement Fixed Variable (in millions) Products* Annuities Annuities Zero or no surrender charge $39,831 $ 9,324 $ 9,765 Greater than 0% 4% 11,248 10,815 8,386 Greater than 4% 2,648 31,183 10,035 Non Surrenderable 892 3,148 81 Total $54,619 $ 54,470 $ 28,267 * Excludes mutual funds. A continued increase in the level of surrenders in any of these businesses could increase the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in future years and will negatively affect fee income earned on assets under management. The combination of reduced sales and increased surrenders and withdrawals resulted in significantly lower net flows for total domestic Retirement Services than in the prior year. AIG expects that net flows will remain lower than in prior years as long as an environment of lackluster equity market performance persists and the yield curve remains flat. The following table reflects the net flows for Domestic Retirement Services: Domestic Retirement Services Net Flows(a) December 31, (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Group retirement products(b) $ 628 $ 1,706 $ 2,756 Individual fixed annuities 1,759 6,169 8,679 Individual variable annuities (336 ) 1,145 927 Individual fixed annuities runoff (2,508 ) (2,084 ) (1,967 ) Total $ (457 ) $ 6,936 $ 10,395 (a) Net flows are defined as deposits received, less benefits, surrenders, withdrawals and death benefits. (b) Includes mutual funds. The majority of the growth in Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums in Foreign Life operations was attributable to the life insurance and personal accident & health lines of business. Globally, AIGs deep and diverse distribution, which includes bancassurance, worksite marketing, direct marketing, and strong agency organizations, provides a powerful platform for growth. This growth was most significant in Japan, where AIG has benefited from a flight to quality and development of multiple distribution channels. In Southeast Asia, AIG maintains significant market share by offering an attractive and diverse product line, distributed by its strong agency force. There has been a continuing trend in Southeast Asia, as the insurance market continues to develop, for clients to purchase investment oriented products at the expense of traditional term or whole life products. For GAAP reporting purposes, only revenues from policy charges for insurance, administration, and surrender charges are reported as GAAP premiums. This product mix shift contributed to the single digit growth rate in Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums. Also in Japan, AIG Edison Life has improved the quality and productivity of its sales force resulting in higher sales and improved new business persistency. AIG Star Life is growing first year premiums as a result of new product introductions and an expanded agency force, and is benefiting from growth in the bank annuity market. However, in March of 2006, Japanese tax authorities are expected to announce a reduction in the amount of premium policyholders may deduct from their Japanese tax returns for certain accident and health products. These products are generally sold by independent agents to corporate clients and thus represent a specific niche market segment and not the mainstream accident and health products sold by AIG in Japan. A reduction in the amount of tax deduction related to these products will make them less attractive to the market and will reduce the level of future sales. In addition, a portion of existing policies may be canceled, and depending on the duration of those policies and other factors, could result in a write off of deferred acquisition costs. At the current time, management does not believe that such losses, should they AIG Form 10 K 45 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued occur, would be material to AIGs consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Foreign Retirement Services business continues its strong growth based upon its success in Japan and Korea by expanding its extensive distribution network and leveraging AIGs product expertise. Somewhat offsetting this growth were the negative effects on customer demand for certain multi currency fixed annuity products in Japan stemming from currency exchange rate fluctuations. AIG is introducing annuity products in new markets. In January 2005, AIG Star Life entered into an agreement with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, one of Japans largest banks, to market a multi currency fixed annuity. Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations produced 78 percent, 78 percent and 76 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums. 2005 Growth in original currency 2.7 % Foreign exchange effect 2.0 Growth as reported in U.S. dollars 4.7 % The growth in net investment income in 2005 and 2004 parallels the growth in general account reserves and surplus for both Foreign and Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies. Also, net investment income was positively affected by the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income along with the addition of new cash flow from operations available for investment. The global flattening of the yield curve put additional pressure on yields and spreads, which was partially offset with income generated from other investment sources, including income from partnerships. Partnership income was $273 million and $192 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of first quarter 2004, foreign separate accounts were transferred to the general account per Statement of Position 03 1, resulting in increased net investment income volatility. The positive effect of Statement of Position 03 1 on Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services net investment income was $1.34 billion and $271 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts do not affect operating income as they are offset in incurred policy benefits. AIGs domestic subsidiaries invest in certain limited liability companies that invest in synthetic fuel production facilities as a means of generating income tax credits. Net investment income includes operating losses of approximately $143 million, $121 million and $108 million, respectively, for 2005, 2004 and 2003 and income taxes includes tax credits and benefits of approximately $203 million, $160 million and $155 million, respectively, for 2005, 2004 and 2003 from these investments. See also Note 12(k) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income grew by 12 percent in 2005. Operating income for the AIG Domestic Life insurance line of business was up 8 percent and in line with the growth in GAAP premiums for the current year, due in part to growth in the business base and improved mortality results, offset by higher losses recorded in 2005 from limited partnership investments in synthetic fuel production facilities. Operating income for the home service line of business declined as a result of the continued decline in premiums in force and higher insurance and acquisition expenses, combined with an increase in property casualty losses related to hurricanes. The group life/health business and operating income were affected by non renewal of cases where acceptable margins could not be achieved. In addition, 2005 results were affected by reserve strengthening related to disability income products totaling $12 million compared to reserve strengthening of $178 million for Superior National and $68 million for all other items in 2004. Operating income for the payout annuities line of business increased 22 percent in line with the growth in policy benefit reserves. The group retirement products business recorded a modest increase in operating income due primarily to higher variable annuity fee income and growth in average reserves. Individual fixed annuity results are higher than last year due primarily to 13 percent growth in average reserves, higher surrender charges and reductions in acquisition cost amortization expense resulting from increased capital losses realized on bonds. Individual variable annuity earnings are lower in 2005 when compared to 2004 principally due to favorable deferred acquisition cost amortization variances attributable to changes in assumptions and realized capital loss activity in 2004. Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income of $5.25 billion for 2005 included $84 million of realized capital gains, and for 2004, operating income of $4.85 billion included $372 million of realized capital gains. Underwriting and investment results before the effects of realized capital gains (losses) increased for all lines of business. On this basis, the life insurance line of business benefited in part from lower amortization of acquisition costs for FAS 97 products, reflective of the increasing investment yields for those portfolios, particularly in Japan. In Southeast Asia, operating income growth attributable to life insurance and deposit based businesses was partially offset by higher incurred policy benefit costs for contributions to the participating policyholder fund in Singapore, totaling $137 million, related to the settlement of a long disputed local tax issue. Growth in the personal accident & health line of business is generally in line with the growth in premiums and reflects stable profit margins. The group products business grew across all segments and maintained profit margins. The largest contributor to the growth in group products is the pension profit center which enjoyed higher fee income emanating from higher assets under management in Brazil and Southeast Asia. Growth in individual fixed annuities, emanating primarily from Japan, is generally in line with the growth in reserves and net spread rates were maintained. The individual variable annuity line of business also grew in line with the growth in reserves. 46 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES The contribution of Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income to AIGs consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to 58 percent in 2005, compared to 53 percent in 2004 and 57 percent in 2003. Underwriting and Investment Risk The risks associated with the life and accident & health products are underwriting risk and investment risk. The risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is primarily investment risk. Underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses. The emergence of significant adverse experience would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves that could have a substantial effect on AIGs results of operations. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect AIGs operating results. Other risks, such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease, such as the Avian Influenza A Virus (H5N1), could adversely affect AIGs business and operating results to an extent that may be only minimally offset by reinsurance programs. While to date, outbreaks of the Avian Flu continue to occur among poultry or wild birds in a number of countries in Asia, parts of Europe, and recently in Africa, transmission to humans has been rare. If the virus mutates to a form that can be transmitted from human to human, it has the potential to spread rapidly worldwide. If such an outbreak were to take place, early quarantine and vaccination could be critical to containment. Both the contagion and mortality rate of any mutated H5N1 virus that can be transmitted from human to human are highly speculative. AIG continues to monitor the developing facts. A significant global outbreak could have a material adverse effect on Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating results and liquidity from increased mortality and morbidity rates. AIGs Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on life insurance of a single life to approximately $1.7 million of coverage. AIGs Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on life insurance of a single life to $10 million of coverage in certain circumstances by using yearly renewable term reinsurance. See the discussion under Liquidity herein and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. AIRCO acts primarily as an internal reinsurance company for AIGs foreign life operations. This facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning locally (branch and subsidiary). It also allows AIG to pool its insurance risks and purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global life catastrophe risks. AIGs domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations utilize internal and third party reinsurance relationships to manage insurance risks and to facilitate capital management strategies. Pools of highly rated third party reinsurers are utilized to manage net amounts at risk in excess of retention limits. AIGs domestic life insurance companies also cede excess, non economic reserves carried on a statutory basis only on certain term and universal life insurance policies and certain fixed annuities to AIG Life of Bermuda Ltd., a wholly owned Bermuda reinsurer. AIG generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain statutory recognition of these intercompany reinsurance transactions. For this purpose, AIG entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated letter of credit facility in December 2004. Letters of credit totaling $2.17 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2004, and letters of credit for all $2.5 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2005, all of which relate to life intercompany reinsurance transactions. The letter of credit facility has a ten year term, but the facility can be reduced or terminated by the lenders beginning after seven years. In November 2005, AIG entered into a revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount of $3 billion. The facility can be drawn in the form of letters of credit with terms of up to ten years. As of December 31, 2005 and as of the date hereof, $1.86 billion principal amount of letters of credit are outstanding under this facility, of which approximately $494 million relates to life intercompany reinsurance transactions. AIG also obtained approximately $212 million letters of credit on a bilateral basis. The investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets, primarily long term fixed rate investments, being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments. See also the discussion under Liquidity herein. To minimize its exposure to investment risk, AIG tests the cash flows from invested assets and policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to evaluate investment risk and to confirm that assets are sufficient to pay these liabilities. AIG actively manages the asset liability relationship in its foreign operations, as it has been doing throughout AIGs history, even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or certain local regulatory authorities may impose investment restrictions. For example, in several Asian countries, the duration of the investments is shorter than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities. Therefore, there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities. Additionally, there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. In 2005, new money investment yields increased in some markets and continued to decrease in others, leading to more frequent adjustments in new business premium rates, credited AIG Form 10 K 47 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued rates, and discontinuance of some products. In regard to the inforce business, to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities, management focus is required in both the investment and product management process. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business. As such, in some countries, sales growth may slow for some product lines and accelerate for others. The investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the proceeds of matured securities and coupons requires active management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. AIG may use alternative investments in certain foreign jurisdictions where interest rates remain low and there are limited long dated bond markets, including equities, real estate and foreign currency denominated fixed income instruments to extend the duration or increase the yield of the investment portfolio to more closely match the requirements of the policyholder liabilities and DAC recoverability. This strategy has been effectively used in Japan and more recently by Nan Shan in Taiwan. Foreign assets comprised approximately 33 percent of Nan Shans invested assets at December 31, 2005, slightly below the maximum allowable percentage under current regulation. In response to continued declining interest rates and the volatile exchange rate of the NT dollar, Nan Shan is emphasizing new products with lower implied guarantees, including participating endowments and variable universal life. Although the risks of a continued low interest rate environment coupled with a volatile NT dollar could increase net liabilities and require additional capital to maintain adequate local solvency margins, Nan Shan currently believes it has adequate resources to meet all future policy obligations. AIG actively manages the asset liability relationship in its domestic operations. This relationship is more easily managed through the ample supply of appropriate long term investments. AIG uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies. As a part of these strategies, AIG may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes. In addition, the absence of long dated fixed income instruments in certain markets may preclude a matched asset liability position in those markets. A number of guaranteed benefits, such as living benefits or guaranteed minimum death benefits, are offered on certain variable life and variable annuity products. AIG manages its exposure resulting from these long term guarantees through reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance for these benefits. DAC for Life Insurance & Retirement Services products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Policy acquisition costs which relate to universal life and investment type products, including variable and fixed annuities (investment oriented products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, as appropriate, in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Amortization expense includes the effects of current period realized capital gains and losses. With respect to universal life and investment oriented products, AIGs policy, as appropriate, has been to adjust amortization assumptions for DAC when estimates of current or future gross profits to be realized from these contracts are revised. With respect to variable annuities sold domestically (representing the vast majority of AIGs variable annuity business), the assumption for the long term annual net growth rate of the equity markets used in the determination of DAC amortization is approximately ten percent. A methodology referred to as reversion to the mean is used to maintain this long term net growth rate assumption, while giving consideration to short term variations in equity markets. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less interest required as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses. Current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the effect on the amortization of DAC. The estimation of projected gross profits requires significant management judgment. The elements with respect to the current and projected gross profits are reviewed and analyzed quarterly and are adjusted accordingly. AIGs variable annuity earnings will be affected by changes in market returns because separate account revenues, primarily composed of mortality and expense charges and asset management fees, are a function of asset values. DAC for both insurance oriented and investment oriented products as well as retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involve estimating the future profitability of current business. This review also involves significant management judgment. If the actual emergence of future profitability were to be substantially different than that estimated, AIGs results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods. See also Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance and Asset Management Invested Assets AIGs investment strategy is to invest primarily in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer, industry and or country concentrations. With respect to Domestic General Insurance, AIGs strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturity investments to maximize the yields at the date of purchase. With respect to Life Insurance & Retirement Services, AIGs strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities. See also the discussion under Operating Review: Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations herein. AIG invests in equities for various reasons, including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk. Available for sale bonds and equity securities are subject to declines in fair value. Such changes in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Generally, insurance 48 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance company may invest. When permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIG and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users.

In certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. The following tables summarize the composition of AIGs insurance and asset management invested assets by segment, at December 31, 2005 and 2004: Life Percent Insurance & Distribution General Retirement Asset Percent (dollars in millions) Insurance Services Management Total of Total Domestic Foreign 2005 Fixed maturities: Available for sale, at market value $ 50,870 $ 273,165 $ 34,174 $ 358,209 66.2 % 59.2 % 40.8 % Held to maturity, at amortized cost 21,528 21,528 4.0 100.0 Trading securities, at market value 1,073 3,563 4,636 0.9 3.3 96.7 Equity securities: Common stocks, at market value 4,930 15,558 639 21,127 3.9 18.6 81.4 Preferred stocks, at market value 1,632 760 2,392 0.4 88.8 11.2 Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans 19 18,406 4,594 23,019 4.3 65.5 34.5 Short term investments, including time deposits, and cash 2,787 6,844 5,815 15,446 2.8 26.1 73.9 Real estate 603 2,729 1,710 5,042 0.9 45.2 54.8 Investment income due and accrued 1,232 4,073 402 5,707 1.1 56.9 43.1 Securities lending collateral 4,931 42,991 11,549 59,471 11.0 87.3 12.7 Other invested assets 6,272 7,805 10,459 24,536 4.5 85.7 14.3 Total $ 94,804 $ 373,404 $ 72,905 $ 541,113 100.0 % 62.3 % 37.7 % 2004 Fixed maturities: Available for sale, at market value $ 44,376 $ 259,602 $ 39,077 $ 343,055 68.5 % 61.2 % 38.8 % Held to maturity, at amortized cost 18,294 18,294 3.7 100.0 Trading securities, at market value 600 2,384 2,984 0.6 1.2 98.8 Equity securities: Common stocks, at market value 4,165 11,280 177 15,622 3.1 21.9 78.1 Preferred stocks, at market value 1,466 565 2,031 0.4 91.9 8.1 Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans 22 16,858 5,093 21,973 4.4 65.6 34.4 Short term investments, including time deposits, and cash 2,113 5,515 9,679 17,307 3.4 37.1 62.9 Real estate 592 3,007 326 3,925 0.8 22.8 77.2 Investment income due and accrued 997 4,035 461 5,493 1.1 57.3 42.7 Securities lending collateral 4,889 34,923 9,357 49,169 9.8 86.7 13.3 Other invested assets 5,604 7,072 8,316 20,992 4.2 86.7 13.3 Total $ 82,518 $ 343,457 $ 74,870 $ 500,845 100.0 % 63.8 % 36.2 % Credit Quality At December 31, 2005, approximately 61 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities. Approximately 35 percent of such domestic securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately six percent were below investment grade or not rated. A significant portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio is rated by Moodys, S&P or similar foreign services. Similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments, including mortgages. At December 31, 2005, approximately 19 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIGs internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately five percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. A large portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance. Any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date. Valuation of Invested Assets AIG has the ability to hold any fixed maturity security to its stated maturity, including those fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale. Therefore, the decision to sell AIG Form 10 K 49 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued any such fixed maturity security classified as available for sale reflects the judgment of AIGs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide, on a relative value basis, as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks. With respect to distressed securities, the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale. The valuation of invested assets involves obtaining a market value for each security. The source for the market value is generally from market exchanges or dealer quotations, with the exception of nontraded securities. If AIG chooses to hold a security, it evaluates the security for an other than temporary impairment in valuation. As a matter of policy, the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of AIGs management and a continual review of its investments. In general, a security is considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment if it meets any of the following criteria: Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par or amortized cost (if lower) for an extended period of time (nine months or longer); The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in (i) the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; or (ii) the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims; or In the opinion of AIGs management, it is probable that AIG may not realize a full recovery on its investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events. Once a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired, the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous market price and recorded as a charge to earnings. As a result of these policies, AIG recorded other than temporary impairment losses net of taxes of approximately $389 million, $369 million and $1.0 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. No impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIGs consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual impairment loss exceeded 1.0 percent of consolidated net income for 2005. Excluding the other than temporary impairments noted above, the changes in market value for AIGs available for sale portfolio, which constitutes the vast majority of AIGs investments, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses, net of tax. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of AIGs fixed maturities and equity securities aggregated to $409.8 billion. At December 31, 2005, aggregate unrealized gains after taxes for fixed maturity and equity securities were $10.5 billion. At December 31, 2005, the aggregate unrealized losses after taxes of fixed maturity and equity securities were approximately $2.6 billion. The effect on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be further mitigated upon realization, because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, or realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain deferred policy acquisition costs. At December 31, 2005, unrealized losses for fixed maturity securities and equity securities did not reflect any significant industry concentrations. The amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005, by contractual maturity, is shown below: (in millions) Amortized Cost Due in one year or less $ 3,882 Due after one year through five years 25,919 Due after five years through ten years 56,204 Due after ten years 56,786 Total $ 142,791 In the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, the pretax realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were $1.6 billion. The aggregate fair value of securities sold was $51.7 billion, which was approximately 97 percent of amortized cost. The average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 were trading continuously at a price below book value was approximately three months. 50 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES At December 31, 2005, aggregate pretax unrealized gains were $16.1 billion, while the pretax unrealized losses with respect to investment grade bonds, below investment grade bonds and equity securities were $3.3 billion, $404 million and $257 million, respectively. Aging of the pretax unrealized losses with respect to these securities, distributed as a percentage of cost relative to unrealized loss (the extent by which the market value is less than amortized cost or cost), including the number of respective items, was as follows: Less than or equal to Greater than 20% to Greater than 50% 20% of Cost(a) 50% of Cost(a) of Cost(a) Total Aging Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized (dollars in millions) Cost(a) Loss Items Cost(a) Loss Items Cost(a) Loss Items Cost(a) Loss(b) Items Investment grade bonds 0 6 months $ 101,885 $ 1,984 12,264 $ 36 $ 9 11 $ $ $ 101,921 $ 1,993 12,275 7 12 months 14,271 426 1,749 1 1 14,272 426 1,750 12 months 19,502 791 2,722 450 107 17 5 3 8 19,957 901 2,747 Total $ 135,658 $ 3,201 16,735 $ 487 $ 116 29 $ 5 $ 3 8 $ 136,150 $ 3,320 16,772 Below investment grade bonds 0 6 months $ 3,651 $ 129 852 $ 111 $ 29 24 $ 11 $ 6 14 $ 3,773 $ 164 890 7 12 months 1,524 93 338 139 38 34 2 1 15 1,665 132 387 12 months 1,113 84 225 90 24 23 11 1,203 108 259 Total $ 6,288 $ 306 1,415 $ 340 $ 91 81 $ 13 $ 7 40 $ 6,641 $ 404 1,536 Total bonds 0 6 months $ 105,536 $ 2,113 13,116 $ 147 $ 38 35 $ 11 $ 6 14 $ 105,694 $ 2,157 13,165 7 12 months 15,795 519 2,087 140 38 35 2 1 15 15,937 558 2,137 12 months 20,615 875 2,947 540 131 40 5 3 19 21,160 1,009 3,006 Total $ 141,946 $ 3,507 18,150 $ 827 $ 207 110 $ 18 $ 10 48 $ 142,791 $ 3,724 18,308 Equity securities 0 6 months $ 3,041 $ 113 1,109 $ 75 $ 23 71 $ 30 $ 20 42 $ 3,146 $ 156 1,222 7 12 months 573 41 122 169 45 68 6 4 23 748 90 213 12 months 66 4 26 30 6 13 1 1 29 97 11 68 Total $ 3,680 $ 158 1,257 $ 274 $ 74 152 $ 37 $ 25 94 $ 3,991 $ 257 1,503 (a) For bonds, represents amortized cost. (b) As more fully described above, upon realization, certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, or realization will result in a current decrease in the amortization of certain deferred policy acquisition costs. As stated previously, the valuation for AIGs investment portfolio comes from market exchanges or dealer quotations, with the exception of nontraded securities. AIG considers nontraded securities to mean certain fixed income investments, certain structured securities, direct private equities, limited partnerships, and hedge funds. The aggregate carrying value of these securities at December 31, 2005 was approximately $62 billion. The methodology used to estimate fair value of nontraded fixed income investments is by reference to traded securities with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology. This technique takes into account such factors as the industry, the securitys rating and tenor, its coupon rate, its position in the capital structure of the issuer, and other relevant factors. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. For certain structured securities, the carrying value is based on an estimate of the securitys future cash flows pursuant to the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99 20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. The change in carrying value is recognized in income. Hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate less than a five percent interest are carried at fair value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. With respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest, AIG uses the equity method to record these investments. The changes in such net asset values are recorded in income. AIG obtains the fair value of its investments in limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the general partner or manager of each of these investments, the accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis. Each of these investment categories is tested to determine if impairment in value exists. Various valuation techniques are used with respect to each category in this determination. Financial Services Operations AIGs Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets transactions, consumer finance and insurance premium financing. See also Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. AIG Form 10 K 51 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Aircraft Finance AIGs Aircraft Finance operations represent the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for its own account, for airlines and for financial institutions. ILFC finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments. The composite borrowing rates at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 5.00 percent, 4.34 percent and 4.53 percent, respectively. See also the discussions under Capital Resources and Liquidity herein and Notes 2 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ILFCs sources of revenue are principally from scheduled and charter airlines and companies associated with the airline industry. The airline industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions, cyclical and highly competitive. Airlines and related companies may be affected by political or economic instability, terrorist activities, changes in national policy, competitive pressures on certain air carriers, fuel prices and shortages, labor stoppages, insurance costs, recessions, and other political or economic events adversely affecting world or regional trading markets. ILFCs revenues and income will be affected by its customers ability to react and cope with the volatile competitive environment in which they operate, as well as ILFCs own competitive environment. ILFC is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through nonperformance of aircraft lessees, through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and, in part, through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease. ILFC manages the risk of nonperformance by its lessees with security deposit requirements, through repossession rights, overhaul requirements, and closely monitoring industry conditions through its marketing force. However, there can be no assurance that ILFC would be able to successfully manage the risks relating to the effect of possible future deterioration in the airline industry. Approximately 90 percent of ILFCs fleet is leased to non U.S. carriers, and this fleet, comprised of the most efficient aircraft in the airline industry, continues to be in high demand from such carriers. ILFC typically contracts to re lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term. For aircraft returned before the end of the lease term, ILFC has generally been able to re lease such aircraft within two to six months of its return. As a lessor, ILFC considers an aircraft idle or off lease when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent. ILFC had no aircraft off lease at December 31, 2005. As of March 10, 2006, all new aircraft deliveries in 2006 have been leased, and 76 percent of 2007 new aircraft deliveries have been leased. See also the discussions under Capital Resources and Liquidity herein. ILFC sold two portfolios consisting of 34 and 37 aircraft in 2004 and 2003, respectively, to two trusts connected to securitization transactions. Certain of AIGs Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses purchased a large share of the securities issued in connection with these securitizations, which included both debt and equity securities. Management formally reviews regularly, and no less frequently than quarterly, issues affecting ILFCs fleet, including events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft values. Management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary, based on these events and circumstances in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144). ILFC has not recognized any impairment related to its fleet, as the existing service potential of the aircraft in ILFCs portfolio has not been diminished. Further, ILFC has been able to re lease the aircraft without diminution in lease rates to an extent that would require an impairment write down. See also the discussions under Liquidity herein. Capital Markets Capital Markets represents the operations of AIGFP, which engages in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and customized interest rate, currency, equity, commodity and credit products and structured borrowings through notes, bonds and guaranteed investment agreements. AIGFP also engages in various commodity and foreign exchange trading, and market making activities. As Capital Markets is a transaction oriented operation, current and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for predicting future performance. Also, AIGs Capital Markets operations may be adversely affected by the downgrades in AIGs credit ratings. See Risk Factors AIGs Credit Ratings, in Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of the potential effect of the rating downgrades on AIGs Capital Markets businesses. AIGs Capital Markets operations derive substantially all their revenues from hedged financial positions entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than from speculative transactions. AIGFP participates in the derivatives and financial transactions dealer markets conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, energy and credit products business. As a dealer in financial derivatives, AIGFP marks all derivative and trading transactions to fair value daily. Thus, a gain or loss on each transaction is recognized daily. Under GAAP, in certain instances, gains and losses are required to be recorded in earnings immediately, whereas in other instances, they are required to be recognized over the life of the underlying instruments. AIGFP economically hedges the market risks arising from its transactions, although hedge accounting is not currently being applied to any of the derivatives and related assets and liabilities. Accordingly, revenues and operating income are exposed to volatility resulting from differences in the timing of revenue recognition between the derivatives and the hedged assets and liabilities. Revenues and operating income of the Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in these amounts for any given period are also significantly affected by the number, size and profitability of transactions entered into by these subsidiaries during that 52 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES period relative to those entered into during the prior period. Generally, the realization of trading revenues as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the gain or loss on AIGFPs trading transactions is currently reflected in operating income as the fair values change from period to period. Derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of Capital Markets operations. Therefore, income on interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, energy and credit derivatives is recorded at fair value, determined by reference to the mark to market value of the derivative or their estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available. The resulting aggregate unrealized gains or losses from the derivative are reflected in the income statement in the current year. Where Capital Markets cannot verify significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model value to market transactions, Capital Markets values the contract at the transaction price at inception and, consequently, records no initial gain or loss in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02 03, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF 02 03). Such initial gain or loss is recognized over the life of the transaction. Capital Markets periodically reevaluates its revenue recognition under EITF 02 03 based on the observability of market parameters. The mark to fair value of derivative transactions is reflected in the balance sheet in the captions Unrealized gain on swaps, options and forward transactions, Unrealized loss on swaps, options and forward transactions, Trading assets and Trading liabilities. Unrealized gains represent the present value of the aggregate of each net receivable by counterparty, and the unrealized losses represent the present value of the aggregate of each net payable by counterparty as of December 31, 2005. These amounts will change from one period to the next due to changes in interest rates, currency rates, equity and commodity prices and other market variables, as well as cash movements, execution of new transactions and the maturing of existing transactions. See also the discussion under Derivatives herein and Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Spread income on investments and borrowings is recorded on an accrual basis over the life of the transaction. Investments are classified as securities available for sale and are marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. U.S. dollar denominated borrowings are carried at cost, while borrowings in any currency other than the U.S. dollar result in unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses reported in income. AIGFP hedges the economic exposure on its investments and borrowings through its derivatives portfolio. The requirements under FAS 133 hedge accounting were not met for these hedge transactions for the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Thus, these hedges are marked to fair value with the unrealized gains or losses reported in income. Consumer Finance Domestically, AIGs Consumer Finance operations are principally conducted through AGF. AGF derives a substantial portion of its revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding mortgages, home equity loans, secured and unsecured consumer loans and retail merchant financing. The real estate loans include first or second mortgages on residential real estate generally having a maximum term of 360 months, and are considered non conforming. These loans may be closed end accounts or open end home equity lines of credit and may be fixed rate or adjustable rate products. The secured consumer loans are secured by consumer goods, automobiles, or other personal property. Both secured and unsecured consumer loans generally have a maximum term of 60 months. The core of AGFs originations are sourced through its branches. However, a significant volume of real estate loans are also originated through broker relationships, and to lesser extents, through correspondent relationships and direct mail solicitations. Many of AGFs borrowers are non conforming, non prime or sub prime. Current economic conditions, such as interest rate and employment, have a direct effect on the borrowers ability to repay these loans. AGF manages the credit risk inherent in its portfolio by using credit scoring models at the time of credit applications, established underwriting criteria, and in certain cases, individual loan reviews. AGFs Credit Strategy and Policy Committee monitors the quality of the finance receivables portfolio on a monthly basis when determining the appropriate level of the allowance for finance receivable losses. The Credit Strategy and Policy Committee bases its conclusions on quantitative analyses, qualitative factors, current economic conditions and trends, and each committee members experience in the consumer finance industry. Through 2005, the credit quality of AGFs finance receivables continues to be strong. Overseas operations, particularly those in emerging markets, provide credit cards, personal and auto loans, term deposits, savings accounts, sales finance and mortgages. Consumer Finance operations are exposed to loss when contractual payments are not received. Credit loss exposure is managed through tight underwriting controls, mix of loans, collateral, and collection efficiency. AIG Form 10 K 53 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Financial Services operations for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues(a): Aircraft Finance(b) $ 3,578 $ 3,136 $ 2,897 Capital Markets(c)(d) 3,260 1,278 595 Consumer Finance(e) 3,613 2,978 2,642 Other 74 103 108 Total $ 10,525 $ 7,495 $ 6,242 Operating income (loss)(a): Aircraft Finance $ 679 $ 642 $ 672 Capital Markets(d) 2,661 662 (188 ) Consumer Finance(f) 901 808 623 Other, including intercompany adjustments 35 68 75 Total $ 4,276 $ 2,180 $ 1,182 (a) Includes the effect of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, the effect was $(34) million, $(27) million and $49 million, respectively, in operating income for Aircraft Finance and $2.01 billion, $(122) million and $(1.01) billion in both revenues and operating income for Capital Markets. (b) Revenues are primarily from ILFC aircraft lease rentals. (c) Revenues, shown net of interest expense, are primarily from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions and the effect of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 described in (a) above. (d) Certain transactions entered into by AIGFP generate tax credits and benefits which are included in income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. The amount of such tax credits and benefits for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are $67 million, $107 million and $123 million, respectively. (e) Revenues are primarily finance charges. (f) Includes $62 million of catastrophe related losses for 2005. Financial Services Results Financial Services operating income increased in 2005 compared to 2004 as well as 2004 compared to 2003. Fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of Capital Markets operations and the effect of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133. Capital Markets operating income was also negatively affected in 2004 by the costs of the PNC settlement. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. To the extent the Financial Services subsidiaries, other than AIGFP, use derivatives to economically hedge their assets or liabilities with respect to their future cash flows, and such hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, the changes in fair value of such derivatives are recorded in realized capital gains (losses) or other revenues. Financial market conditions in 2005 compared with 2004 were characterized by a general flattening of interest rate yield curves across fixed income markets globally, some tightening of credit spreads and equity valuations that were slightly higher. AIGFPs 2005 results were adversely affected by customer uncertainty surrounding the negative actions of the rating agencies and the ongoing investigations, as well as the negative effect on its structured notes business of AIG being unable to fully access the capital markets during 2005. Financial market conditions in 2004 compared with 2003 were characterized by interest rates which were broadly unchanged across fixed income markets globally, a tightening of credit spreads and higher equity valuations. Capital Markets results in 2004 compared with 2003 reflected a shift in product activity to respond to these conditions. The most significant component of Capital Markets operating expenses is compensation, which was approximately $481 million, $497 million and $616 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of compensation was not affected by gains and losses not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. ILFC continued to see net improvements in lease rates, an increase in demand for the newer, modern, fuel efficient aircraft comprising the bulk of ILFCs fleet, and an increasing level of interest from traditional buyers, third party investors and debt providers for the purchase of aircraft from ILFCs extensive lease portfolio. During 2005, ILFCs revenues and operating income also increased as a result of adding more aircraft to its fleet and earning higher revenues on existing aircraft. However, these increases were offset by increasing interest rates, fewer aircraft sales, and leasing related and other reserves. During the fourth quarter of 2004, ATA Airlines and related entities (ATA) filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On the basis of estimates of the probable outcome of the ATA bankruptcy, ILFC recorded pre tax charges aggregating $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 to write down the value of the ATA securities and guarantees. Consumer Finance operations, both domestically and internationally, did very well with increased revenues and operating income. Domestically, the Consumer Finance operations had a record year in 2005. The relatively low interest rate environment contributed to a high level of mortgage refinancing activity. Real estate finance receivables increased 21 percent during 2005. Despite high energy costs, the U.S. economy continued to expand during the year improving consumer credit quality. Both AGFs charge off ratio and delinquency ratio improved over prior years. However, AGF incurred charges of approximately $62 million for the estimated effect of Hurricane Katrina on customers in the Gulf Coast areas affected by the storm. A new bankruptcy law went into effect in October 2005. Consumers, including some of AGFs customers, filed for personal bankruptcy protection under the old law in record numbers in third quarter 2005 ahead of the new laws effective date. AGF does not anticipate a significant effect on its earnings from this new law because 80 percent of its finance receivables are real estate loans with adequate collateral and conservative loan to value ratios. Foreign Consumer Finance operations performed well, as the operations in Poland, Argentina and AIG Federal Savings Bank recorded strong earnings growth. The Hong Kong 54 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES businesses experienced solid loan and earnings growth in a strengthening economy. Financial Services operating income represented 28 percent of AIGs consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2005. This compares to 15 percent and 10 percent in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in contribution percentage in 2005 compared to 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to the fluctuation in earnings resulting from derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133 and the reduction in General Insurance operating income in 2005. Financial Services Invested Assets The following table is a summary of the composition of AIGs Financial Services invested assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004. See also the discussions under Operating Review Financial Services Operations, Capital Resources and Derivatives herein. 2005 2004 Invested Percent of Invested Percent of (dollars in millions) Assets Total Assets Total Flight equipment primarily under operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation $ 36,245 24.1 % $ 32,130 21.6 % Finance receivables, net of allowance 27,995 18.6 23,574 15.9 Unrealized gain on swaps, options and forward transactions 18,695 12.4 22,670 15.3 Securities available for sale, at market value 37,511 24.9 31,225 21.0 Trading securities, at market value 6,499 4.3 2,746 1.8 Securities purchased under agreements to resell, at contract value 14,519 9.7 26,272 17.7 Trading assets 1,204 0.8 3,433 2.3 Spot commodities 92 0.1 534 0.4 Other, including short term investments 7,615 5.1 5,982 4.0 Total $ 150,375 100.0 % $ 148,566 100.0 % As previously discussed, the cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ILFCs debt financings. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. During 2005, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing $6.19 billion. See also the discussion under Operating Review Financial Services Operations and Capital Resources herein. At December 31, 2005, ILFC had committed to purchase 338 new and used aircraft deliverable from 2006 through 2015 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $23.3 billion and had options to purchase 16 new aircraft at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion. As of March 10, 2006, ILFC has entered into leases for all of the new aircraft to be delivered in 2006, 65 of 85 of the new aircraft to be delivered in 2007 and 11 of 155 of the new aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2007. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft currently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing, but there can be no assurance that such success will continue in future environments. AIGs Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products, including real estate mortgages, credit cards, consumer loans, retail sales finance and credit related insurance to customers both domestically and overseas, particularly in emerging markets. These products are funded through a combination of deposits and various borrowings including commercial paper and medium term notes. AIGs Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. Over half of the loan balance is related to real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties. With respect to credit losses, the allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio. Capital Markets derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that the effect of any such event would not be significant to AIGs financial condition or its overall liquidity. See also the discussion under Operating Review Financial Services Operations and Derivatives herein. AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes, bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, including securities available for sale, at market, and derivative transactions. The funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing GIAs or other AIGFP financings, or invest in new assets. See also the discussion under Capital Resources herein. Securities available for sale is predominately a portfolio of fixed income securities, where the individual securities have AIG Form 10 K 55 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued varying degrees of credit risk. At December 31, 2005, the average credit rating of this portfolio was AA+ or the equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal review. AIGFP has also entered into credit derivative transactions to economically hedge its credit risk associated with $125 million of these securities. Securities deemed below investment grade at December 31, 2005 amounted to approximately $166 million in fair value representing 0.4 percent of the total AIGFP securities available for sale. There have been no significant downgrades through March 1, 2006. If its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default swap counterparty failed to perform, AIGFP could have a liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFPs payment obligations, including its debt obligations. AIGFPs risk management objective is to minimize interest rate, currency, commodity and equity risks associated with its securities available for sale. That is, when AIGFP purchases a security for its securities available for sale investment portfolio, it simultaneously enters into an offsetting internal hedge such that the payment terms of the hedging transaction offset the payment terms of the investment security, which achieves the economic result of converting the return on the underlying security to U.S. dollar LIBOR plus or minus a spread based on the underlying profit on each security on the initial trade date. The market risk associated with such internal hedges is managed on a portfolio basis, with third party hedging transactions executed as necessary. As hedge accounting treatment is not achieved in accordance with FAS 133, the unrealized gains and losses on the securities related economic hedges are reflected in operating income, whereas the unrealized gains and losses on the underlying securities resulting from changes in interest rates, currency rates, commodity and equity prices, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. When a security is sold, the related hedging transaction is terminated, and the realized gain or loss with respect to this security is then recorded in operating income. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized financing transactions. AIGFP takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIGFP further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and, when it deems necessary, it requires additional collateral to be deposited. AIGFP also conducts, as principal, trading activities in foreign exchange, and commodities, primarily precious metals. AIGFP owns inventories in the commodities, which it records at the lower of cost or market, in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures, and option contracts. AIGFP uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. AIGFP supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities, unrealized losses on swaps, short term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased. See also the discussions under Capital Resources herein and Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading securities, at market value, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value, are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These trading securities are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of Capital Markets operations. The gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of Capital Markets operations included in the financial services assets and liabilities at December 31, 2005 were as follows: Gross Gross Unrealized Unrealized (in millions) Gains Losses Securities available for sale, at market value(a) $ 802 $ 863 Unrealized gain/loss on swaps, options and forward transactions(b) 18,695 12,740 (a) See also Note 8(h) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) These amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for Capital Markets operations. AIGs senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market, operational and credit issues of the Capital Markets operations. The senior management of AIGFP reports the results of its operations to and reviews future strategies with AIGs senior management. AIGFP actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIGFP must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. AIGFP held a large portfolio of privately negotiated financing transactions with institutional counterparties in the United Kingdom. Certain provisions in the UK Finance Bill that was published by the House of Commons on March 22, 2005 caused AIGFPs counterparties to exercise early unwind rights and terminate these transactions during the first and second quarters of 2005. Although the unwinding of these transactions did not cause AIGFP to suffer any losses, the unwinds did result in AIGFP not realizing spread income that AIGFP expected it would have realized had the transactions remained outstanding. The aggregate reduction in 2005 operating income attributable to such foregone accrual earnings was approximately $75 million. Asset Management Operations AIGs Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety of investment related services and investment products including institutional and retail asset management, broker dealer services and spread based investment business from the sale of GICs. Such services and products are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas. 56 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES As discussed above, AIG Retirement Services operations are reported with Life Insurance operations. Therefore, Asset Management operations represent the results of AIGs asset management and brokerage services operations, mutual fund operations and the foreign and domestic GIC operations. Asset Management revenues and operating income for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues: Guaranteed Investment Contracts $ 3,547 $ 3,192 $ 2,619 Institutional Asset Management 1,195 1,049 671 Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds 257 249 206 Other 326 224 155 Total $ 5,325 $ 4,714 $ 3,651 Operating income: Guaranteed Investment Contracts(a) $ 1,185 $ 1,328 $ 885 Institutional Asset Management(b) 686 515 227 Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds 66 70 60 Other 316 212 144 Total $ 2,253 $ 2,125 $ 1,316 (a) The effect of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 was $149 million, $313 million and $230 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (b) Includes the results of certain AIG managed private equity and real estate funds that are consolidated effective December 31, 2003 pursuant to FIN46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. For 2005 and 2004, operating income includes $261 million and $195 million of third party limited partner earnings offset in Minority interest expense. Asset Management Results Asset Management operating income increased in 2005 as a result of a diversified global product portfolio. The operating income growth was driven by growth in institutional assets under management and the associated fee revenue along with strong realized gains on sales of real estate investments and performance fees earned on various private equity investments. The level of gains and performance based fees are contingent upon various fund closings, maturity levels and market conditions, and by their nature, are not predictable. Therefore, the effect on the segments future earnings may vary from period to period. The revenues and operating income with respect to the segment are largely affected by the general conditions in the equity and credit markets. The increases in full year segment results were achieved despite the run off of the existing GIC portfolio and the delay in launching AIGs domestic matched investment program. GICs are sold domestically and abroad to both institutions and individuals. These products are written on an opportunistic basis when market conditions are favorable. A significant portion of the GIC portfolio consists of floating rate obligations. AIG has entered into hedges to manage against increases in short term interest rates. AIG continues to believe these hedges are economically effective but do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133. As a result, continued increases in short term interest rates will negatively affect operating income in this segment. A positive benefit to realized capital gains (losses) will offset any negative trend in operating income. GIC revenues include income from SunAmerica partnerships supporting the GIC line of business and are significantly affected by performance in the equity markets. Thus, revenues, operating income and cash flow attributable to GICs will vary from one reporting period to the next. The decline in GIC operating income compared to 2004 reflects tighter spreads in the GIC portfolio, partially offset by improved partnership returns. Spread compression has occurred as the base portfolio yield declined due to an increase in the cost of funds in the short term floating rate portion of the GIC portfolio, only partially offset by increased investment income from the floating rate assets backing the portfolio. In September 2005, AIG launched a $10 billion matched investment program in the Euromarkets under which AIG debt securities will be issued. AIG also expects to launch a matched investment program in the domestic market which, along with the Euro program, will become AIGs principal spread based investment activity. However, in light of recent developments, the timing of the launch of the domestic program is uncertain. Because AIGs credit spreads in the capital markets have widened following the ratings declines, there may be a reduction in the earnings on new business in AIGs institutional spread based funding business. Asset Management operating income represented 15 percent of AIGs consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2005. This compares to 14 percent and 11 percent in 2004 and 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2005, AIGs third party assets under management, including both retail mutual funds and institutional accounts, was approximately $62 billion compared to $51 billion at year end 2004. The aggregate GIC reserve was $48.8 billion at December 31, 2005 compared to $53.8 billion at year end 2004. Other Operations Other operations include AIGs equity in certain partially owned companies, the distributions on the liabilities connected to trust preferred stock, as well as the unallocated corporate expenses of the parent holding company and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Other income (loss) amounted to $(2.48) billion, $(560) million and $(1.90) billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. AIGs equity in certain partially owned subsidiaries includes $312 million and $96 million in catastrophe losses in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in the 2005 amount is approximately $1.6 billion for the settlements described under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. See also Notes 12(i) and 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. AIG Form 10 K 57 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Other realized capital gains (losses) amounted to $225 million, $(227) million and $(643) million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capital Resources At December 31, 2005, AIG had total consolidated shareholders equity of $86.32 billion and total consolidated borrowings of $109.85 billion. At that date, $99.42 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs), liabilities connected to trust preferred stock, or matched notes and bonds payable. Borrowings At December 31, 2005, AIGs net borrowings were $10.43 billion after reflecting amounts that were matched borrowings under AIGFPs obligations of GIAs, matched notes and bonds payable, amounts not guaranteed by AIG and liabilities connected to trust preferred stock.

For a description of the effects on AIGs capital resources, including the cost of borrowing, of recent downgrades and rating actions by the major rating agencies, see the discussion under Outlook herein and Risk Factors AIGs Credit Ratings, in Item 1A. Risk Factors as well as Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2005, AIG did not issue any medium term notes, and $555 million of previously issued notes matured. On September 30, 2005, AIG sold $1.5 billion principal amount of notes in a Rule 144A/ Regulation S offering, $500 million of which bear interest at a rate of 4.700 percent per annum and mature in 2010 and $1.0 billion of which bear interest at a rate of 5.05 percent per annum and mature in 2015. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of AIG and rank equally with all of AIGs other senior debit outstanding. AIG has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate an exchange offer for the notes pursuant to an effective registration statement within 360 days of the date on which the notes were issued. AIG intends to continue its customary practice of issuing debt securities from time to time to meet its financing needs 58 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES and those of certain of its subsidiaries for general corporate purposes, as well as for a matched investment program. In September 2005, AIG entered into loan agreements with third party banks and borrowed a total of $600 million under the loan agreements on an unsecured basis, $500 million of which matures in August 2006 but can be extended by AIG for an additional seven month period and $100 million of which matures in September 2006. AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities and derivative transactions. The borrowings may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIG guarantees the obligations of AIGFP under AIGFPs notes and bonds and GIA borrowings. See also the discussions under Operating Review, Liquidity and Derivatives herein and Notes 1, 8, 9 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. AIGFP has a Euro Medium Term Note Program under which an aggregate nominal amount of up to $10.0 billion of notes may be outstanding at any one time. The program provides that additional notes may be issued to replace matured or redeemed notes. As of December 31, 2005, $3.48 billion of notes were outstanding under the program, including $221 million resulting from foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars. Notes issued under this program are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. AIG Funding, Inc. (AIG Funding), through the issuance of commercial paper, helps fulfill the short term cash requirements of AIG and its subsidiaries. AIG Funding intends to continue to meet AIGs funding requirements through the issuance of commercial paper guaranteed by AIG. The issuance of AIG Fundings commercial paper is subject to the approval of AIGs Board of Directors. AIG and AIG Funding are parties to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities aggregating $2.75 billion, consisting of $1.375 billion in a 364 day revolving credit facility that expires in July of 2006 and $1.375 billion in a five year revolving credit facility that expires in July of 2010. The 364 day facility allows for the conversion by AIG of any outstanding loans at expiration into one year term loans. The facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for AIGs commercial paper programs administered by AIG Funding. AIG expects to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under these facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005. In November 2005, AIG and AIG Funding entered into a 364 day revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount of $3 billion, which can be drawn in the form of loans or letters of credit. The credit facility expires in November 2006 but allows for the issuance of letters of credit with terms of up to ten years and provides for the conversion by AIG of any outstanding loans at expiration into one year term loans. The facility can be used for general corporate purposes, including providing backup for AIGs commercial paper programs administered by AIG Funding and obtaining letters of credit to secure obligations under insurance and reinsurance transactions. There are currently no loans outstanding under the facility, nor were any loans outstanding as of December 31, 2005. As of such dates, $1.14 billion was available to be drawn under the facility, with the remainder having been drawn in the form of letters of credit. AIG is also a party to an unsecured 364 day inter company revolving credit facility provided by certain of its subsidiaries aggregating $2 billion that expires in October of 2006. The facility allows for the conversion of any outstanding loans at expiration into one year term loans. The facility can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for AIGs commercial paper programs. AIG expects to replace or extend this credit facility on or prior to its expiration. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under the inter company facility, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005. As of November 2001, AIG guaranteed the notes and bonds of AGC. During 2005, $300 million of previously issued notes matured. ILFC fulfills its short term cash requirements through the issuance of commercial paper. The issuance of commercial paper is subject to the approval of ILFCs Board of Directors. The commercial paper issued by ILFC is not guaranteed by AIG. ILFC is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities aggregating $6.0 billion at December 31, 2005. The facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for ILFCs commercial paper program. They consist of $2.0 billion in a 364 day revolving credit facility that expires in October 2006, with a one year term out option, $2.0 billion in a five year revolving credit facility that expires in October 2009 and $2.0 billion in a five year revolving credit facility that expires in October 2010. ILFC expects to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under these facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005. ILFC was a party to two 180 day revolving credit facilities aggregating to $1.0 billion, each of which expired in 2005. At December 31 2005, ILFC had increased the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its medium term and long term notes. The foreign exchange adjustment for the foreign currency denominated debt was $197 million at December 31, 2005 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2004. ILFC had $13.13 billion of debt securities registered for public sale at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, $8.66 billion of debt securities were issued. In addition, ILFC has a Euro Medium Term Note Program for $7.0 billion, under which $4.98 billion in notes were sold through December 31, 2005. ILFC has substantially eliminated the currency exposure arising from foreign currency denominated notes by economically hedging that portion of the note exposure not already offset by Euro denominated operating lease payments, although such hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. Notes issued under this program are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit Facility (ECA) for use in connection with the purchase of approximately 75 aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility was guaranteed by AIG Form 10 K 59 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on these amortizing ten year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At December 31, 2005, ILFC had $1.2 billion outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. In May 2004, ILFC entered into a similarly structured ECA for up to a maximum of $2.64 billion for Airbus aircraft to be delivered through May 31, 2005. The facility has since been extended to include aircraft to be delivered through May 31, 2006. The facility becomes available as the various European Export Credit Agencies provide their guarantees for aircraft based on a six month forward looking calendar, and the interest rate is determined through a bid process. At December 31, 2005, ILFC had $1.4 billion outstanding under this facility. Borrowings with respect to these facilities are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. In August 2004, ILFC received a commitment for an Ex Im Bank comprehensive guarantee in the amount of $1.68 billion to support the financing of up to 30 new Boeing aircraft. The initial delivery period from September 1, 2004 through August 31, 2005 has been extended by ILFC to August 31, 2006. ILFC did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2005. From time to time, ILFC enters into various bank financings. As of December 31, 2005 the total funded amount was $1.4 billion. The financings mature through 2010. One tranche of one of the loans totaling $410 million was funded in Japanese yen and swapped to U.S. dollars. In December of 2005, ILFC entered into two tranches of junior subordinated debt totaling $1.0 billion. Both mature on December 21, 2065, but each tranche has a different call option. The $600 million tranche has a call date of December 21, 2010 and the $400 million tranche has a call date of December 21, 2015. The note with the 2010 call date has a fixed interest rate of 5.90 percent for the first five years. The note with the 2015 call date has a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent for the first ten years. Both tranches have interest rate adjustments if the call option is not exercised. The new interest rate is a floating quarterly reset rate based on the initial credit spread plus the highest of (i) 3 month LIBOR, (ii) 10 year constant maturity treasury and (iii) 30 year constant maturity treasury. The proceeds of ILFCs debt financing are primarily used to purchase flight equipment, including progress payments during the construction phase. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. AIG does not guarantee the debt obligations of ILFC. See also the discussions under Operating Review and Liquidity herein. AGF fulfills its short term cash requirements through the issuance of commercial paper. The issuance of commercial paper is subject to the approval of AGFs Board of Directors. The commercial paper issued by AGF is not guaranteed by AIG. AGF is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities which, as of December 31, 2005 aggregated to $4.25 billion, consisting of $2.125 billion in a 364 day revolving credit facility that expires in July 2006 and $2.125 billion in a five year revolving credit facility that expires in July 2010. The 364 day facility allows for the conversion by AGF of any outstanding loan at expiration into a one year term loan. The facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for AGFs commercial paper programs. AGF expects to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration. There are currently no borrowings under these AGF facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005. During 2005, AGF issued $5.44 billion of fixed rate and variable rate medium term notes ranging in maturities from two to ten years. As of December 31, 2005, notes aggregating $17.74 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2006 to 2015 at interest rates ranging from 1.65 percent to 7.50 percent. To the extent deemed appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing with respect to these notes. AGFs other funding sources include private placement debt, retail note issuances and bank financings. In addition, AGF has become an established issuer of long term debt in the international capital markets. In addition to debt refinancing activities, proceeds from the collection of finance receivables will be used to pay the principal and interest with respect to AGFs debt. AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of AGF. See also the discussion under Operating Review Financial Services Operations and Liquidity herein. AIG Credit Card Company (Taiwan) and AIG Finance (Taiwan) Limited, both consumer finance subsidiaries in Taiwan, have issued commercial paper for the funding of their own operations. AIG does not guarantee the commercial paper issued by these subsidiaries.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The maturity schedule of AIGs contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 was as follows: Payments due by Period Less One Four Than Through Through After Total One Three Five Five (in millions) Payments Year Years Years Years Borrowings(a) $ 99,291 $ 31,504 $ 20,717 $ 16,886 $ 30,184 Loss reserves(b) 77,169 21,221 23,537 11,191 21,220 Insurance and investment contract liabilities(c) 47,956 8,639 16,019 9,855 13,443 Operating leases 2,734 573 761 468 932 Aircraft purchase commitments 23,320 6,037 10,524 3,775 2,984 Total $ 250,470 $ 67,974 $ 71,558 $ 42,175 $ 68,763 (a) Excludes commercial paper and obligations included as debt pursuant to FIN46R. See also Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) Represents future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. (c) Insurance and investment contract liabilities include various investment type products with contractually scheduled maturities including periodic payments of a term certain nature and guaranteed maturities under guaranteed investment contracts. Items excluded from the table include (i) liabilities for future policy benefits of approximately $109 billion, and (ii) policyholder contract deposits of approximately $182 billion. Amounts excluded from the table are generally comprised of policies or contracts where (i) AIG is currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship, or (iii) the occurrence of a payment due to a surrender or other non scheduled event out of AIGs control. The determination of these liability amounts and timing of payment are not reasonably fixed and determinable. Significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns, inflation, and future policyholder elections as to benefits. The maturity schedule of AIGs other commercial commitments by segment at December 31, 2005 was as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration Less One Four Total Than Through Through After Amounts One Three Five Five (in millions) Committed Year Years Years Years Letters of credit: Life Insurance & Retirement Services $ 185 $ 53 $ 9 $ 22 $ 101 DBG 188 188 Standby letters of credit: Capital Markets 1,758 8 52 70 1,628 Guarantees: Life Insurance & Retirement Services(a) 3,456 109 400 2,947 Aircraft Finance 147 51 14 82 Asset Management 82 27 9 46 Parent Company(b) 393 392 1 Other commercial commitments(c): Capital Markets(d) 10,932 2,241 1,734 789 6,168 Aircraft Finance(e) 1,883 131 868 884 Life Insurance & Retirement Services(f) 3,505 626 1,286 748 845 Asset Management 607 437 155 15 DBG(g) 1,334 1,334 Total $ 24,470 $ 4,132 $ 3,791 $ 2,558 $ 13,989 (a) Primarily AIG SunAmerica construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. (b) Represents reimbursement obligations under letters of credit issued by commercial banks. (c) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The annual pension contribution for 2006 is expected to be approximately $70 million for U.S. and non U.S. plans. See also Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Primarily liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (e) Primarily in connection with options to acquire aircraft. (f) Primarily AIG SunAmerica commitments to invest in partnerships. (g) Primarily commitments to invest in limited partnerships. Rating triggers have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. Rating triggers generally relate to events which (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. AIG Form 10 K 61 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued AIG believes that any of its or its subsidiaries contractual obligations that are subject to ratings triggers or financial covenants relating to ratings triggers would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or liquidity. As a result of the downgrades of AIGs long term senior debt ratings, AIG was required to post approximately $1.16 billion of collateral with counterparties to municipal guaranteed investment contracts and financial derivatives transactions. In the event of a further downgrade, AIG will be required to post additional collateral. It is estimated that, as of the close of business on February 28, 2006, based on AIGs outstanding municipal guaranteed investment agreements and financial derivatives transactions as of such date, a further downgrade of AIGs long term senior debt ratings to Aa3 by Moodys or AA by S&P would permit counterparties to call for approximately $962 million of additional collateral. Further, additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral, which could have a material effect on how AIG manages its liquidity. The actual amount of additional collateral that AIG would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions, the market value of the outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. Additional obligations to post collateral will increase the demand on AIGs liquidity. Shareholders Equity AIGs consolidated shareholders equity increased $6.64 billion during 2005. During 2005, retained earnings increased $8.86 billion, resulting from net income less dividends. Unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes, decreased $1.98 billion and the cumulative translation adjustment loss, net of taxes, increased $540 million. During 2005, there was a gain of $28 million, net of taxes, relating to derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments. See also the discussion under Operating Review and Liquidity herein, Notes 1(ee), 8(d) and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities. Stock Purchase During 2005, AIG purchased in the open market 2,477,100 shares of its common stock. AIG from time to time may buy shares of its common stock in the open market for general corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans. At December 31, 2005, an additional 36,542,700 shares could be purchased under the then current authorization by AIGs Board of Directors. Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. With respect to AIGs domestic insurance subsidiaries, the payment of any dividend requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled. Under the laws of many states, an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain regulatory thresholds. Largely as a result of the restrictions, approximately 89 percent of consolidated shareholders equity was restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 2005. To enhance their current capital positions, dividends from the DBG companies were suspended in the fourth quarter of 2005, and AIG has taken various other actions. See Regulation and Supervision below. Furthermore, AIG cannot predict how recent regulatory investigations may affect the ability of its regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. See Risk Factors Regulatory Investigations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. With respect to AIGs foreign insurance subsidiaries, the most significant insurance regulatory jurisdictions include Bermuda, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Thailand and Singapore. AIG cannot predict whether the regulatory investigations currently underway or future regulatory issues will impair AIGs financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. To AIGs knowledge, no AIG company is currently on any regulatory or similar watch list with regard to solvency. See also the discussion under Liquidity herein and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Regulation and Supervision AIGs insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. In the U.S. the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance companys statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. In connection with its Restatements, AIG examined and evaluated each of the items that have been restated or adjusted in its consolidated GAAP financial statements to determine whether restatement of the previously filed statutory financial statements of its insurance company subsidiaries would be required. In October and early November 2005, AIG completed its audited statutory financial statements for 2004 for all of the Domestic General Insurance companies. The statutory accounting treatment of the various items requiring adjustment or restatement was reviewed and agreed to with the relevant state insurance regulators in advance of the filings. Adjustments necessary to reflect the cumulative effect on statutory surplus of adjustments relating to years prior to 2004 were made to 2004 opening surplus, and 2004 statutory net income was restated accordingly. Previously reported General Insurance 62 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES statutory surplus at December 31, 2004 was reduced by approximately $3.5 billion to approximately $20.6 billion. AIG also recently completed its 2005 unaudited statutory financial statements for all of its Domestic General Insurance subsidiaries, again after reviewing and agreeing with the relevant state insurance regulators the statutory accounting treatment of various items. The state regulators have permitted the Domestic General Insurance companies to record a $724 million reduction to opening statutory surplus as of January 1, 2005 to reflect the effects of the Second Restatement. Statutory capital of each company continued to exceed minimum company action level requirements following the adjustments, but AIG nonetheless contributed an additional $750 million of capital into American Home effective September 30, 2005 and contributed a further $2.25 billion of capital in February 2006 for a total of approximately $3 billion of capital into Domestic General Insurance subsidiaries effective December 31, 2005. To enhance their current capital positions, dividends from the DBG companies were suspended in the fourth quarter of 2005. AIG believes it has the capital resources and liquidity to fund any necessary statutory capital contributions. AIG will review the capital position of its insurance company subsidiaries with various rating agencies and regulators to determine if additional capital contributions or other actions are warranted. As discussed above, various regulators have commenced investigations into certain insurance business practices. In addition, the OTS and other regulators routinely conduct examinations of AIG and its subsidiaries, including AIGs consumer finance operations. AIG cannot predict the ultimate effect that these investigations and examinations, or any additional regulation arising therefrom, might have on its business. Federal, state or local legislation may affect AIGs ability to operate and expand its various financial services businesses, and changes in the current laws, regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses. See Risk Factors Regulatory Investigations in Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of the effect these investigations may have on AIGs businesses. AIGs U.S. operations are negatively affected under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities. Therefore, the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated. The guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $124 million, $118 million and $77 million, respectively. AIG is also required to participate in various involuntary pools (principally workers compensation business) which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets. This participation is also recorded upon notification, as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated. A substantial portion of AIGs General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIGs insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIGs international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of AIGs operations without compensation. Adverse effects resulting from any one country may affect AIGs results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIGs net financial exposure at that time in that country. Foreign insurance operations are individually subject to local solvency margin requirements that require maintenance of adequate capitalization, which AIG complies with by country. In addition, certain foreign locations, notably Japan, have established regulations that can result in guarantee fund assessments. These have not had a material effect on AIGs results of operations. Liquidity AIGs liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its General and Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations. Management believes that AIGs liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to short term funding through commercial paper and bank credit facilities will enable it to meet any anticipated cash requirements. See Risk Factors Access to Capital Markets in Item 1A. Risk Factors. At December 31, 2005, AIGs consolidated invested assets included $17.24 billion of cash and short term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2005 amounted to $25.14 billion. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders contract deposits, cash flows from investment operations and paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, and acquisition and operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses. See also the discussions under Operating Review General Insurance AIG Form 10 K 63 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Operations and Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations herein. With respect to General Insurance operations, if paid losses accelerated beyond AIGs ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, AIG might need to liquidate a portion of its General Insurance investment portfolio and or arrange for financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of several significant catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time. Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable significantly decreased in value. See also the discussions under Operating Review General Insurance Operations herein. With respect to Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations, if a substantial portion of the Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and or defaulted, AIG might need to liquidate other portions of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolio and or arrange financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic collapse of a nation or region in which AIG Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations exist, nationalization, terrorist acts, or other such economic or political upheaval. In addition, a significant rise in interest rates leading to a significant increase in policyholder surrenders could also create a liquidity strain. See also the discussions under Operating Review Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations herein. In addition to the combined insurance pretax operating cash flow, AIGs insurance operations held $9.63 billion in cash and short term investments at December 31, 2005. Operating cash flow and the cash and short term balances held provided AIGs insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. AIG subsidiaries have also issued debt securities to fund insurance needs. In December 2005, Transatlantic issued $750 million of debt securities in a public offering, of which $450 million were purchased by other AIG subsidiaries. Transatlantic contributed the proceeds of the offering to a reinsurance company subsidiary. This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase predominately high quality and diversified fixed income securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities, and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans, and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately $139 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately $165 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 2005. AIGs major Financial Services operating subsidiaries consist of AIGFP, ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG. Sources of funds considered in meeting the liquidity needs of AIGFPs operations include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long term and short term debt, proceeds from maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased. ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG all utilize the commercial paper markets, retail and wholesale deposits, bank loans and bank credit facilities as sources of liquidity. ILFC and AGF also fund in the domestic and international capital markets without reliance on any guarantee from AIG. An additional source of liquidity for ILFC is the use of export credit facilities. AIGCFG also uses wholesale and retail bank deposits as sources of funds. On occasion, AIG has provided equity capital to ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG and provides intercompany loans to AIGCFG. An AIG subsidiary purchased additional shares of ILFC in the amount of $400 million during the third quarter of 2005. Cash flow provided from operations is a major source of liquidity for AIGs primary Financial Services operating subsidiaries. AIG, the parent company, funds its short term working capital needs through commercial paper issued by AIG Funding. As of December 31, 2005, AIG Funding had $2.69 billion of commercial paper outstanding with an average maturity of 32 days. At February 28, 2006, AIG Funding had $5.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding with an average maturity of 24 days. As additional liquidity, AIG parent has a $2 billion inter company revolving credit facility provided by certain of its subsidiaries, a $1.375 billion 364 day revolving bank credit facility that expires in July 2006, a $1.375 billion five year revolving bank credit facility that expires in July 2010 and a $3 billion 364 day revolving credit facility that expires in November 2006, of which $1.14 billion is currently available as back up liquidity. AIG parents primary sources of cash flow are dividends and loans from its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of regulatory restrictions, approximately 89 percent of consolidated shareholders equity was restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 2005. AIG cannot predict how recent regulatory investigations may affect the ability of its regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. See Risk Factors Regulatory Investigations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. AIG parents primary uses of cash flow are for debt service, capital contributions to subsidiaries and the payment of dividends to shareholders. See also Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on debt maturities for AIG and its subsidiaries. The capital contributions referred to under Item 1. Business Regulation and the settlements described under Item 3. Legal Proceedings were funded using existing capacity from internal and external sources, including the issuance of commercial paper. Special Purpose Vehicles and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements AIG uses special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. As a result of recent changes in accounting, a number of SPVs and off balance sheet arrangements have been reflected in AIGs consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). FIN 46 addressed the consolidation and disclosure rules for nonoperating entities that are now 64 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES defined as Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). In December 2003, FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46R). AIG has guidelines with respect to the formation of and investment in SPVs and off balance sheet arrangements. In addition, AIG has expanded the responsibility of its Complex Structured Financial Transaction Committee (CSFT) to include the review of any transaction that could subject AIG to heightened legal, reputational, regulatory, accounting or other risk. See Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A of Part II for a further discussion of the CSFT. For additional information related to AIGs activities with respect to VIEs and certain guarantees see Recent Accounting Standards herein and also Notes 1 and 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, for additional disclosure regarding AIGs commercial commitments (including guarantors), see Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments herein. Derivatives Derivatives are financial instruments among two or more parties with returns linked to or derived from some underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or index. Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities, commodities, financial or commodity indices, or other variables. The more significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures and options. In the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty. The overwhelming majority of AIGs derivatives activities are conducted by the Capital Markets operations, thus permitting AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG structures transactions that generally allow its counterparties to obtain, or hedge, exposure to changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates, credit events, securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. AIGs customers such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. To help manage this risk, AIGFPs credit department operates within the guidelines set by the AIG Credit Risk Committee. This committee establishes the credit policy, sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account other factors, including the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the specific approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIGs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary. In addition, AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, and margin agreements to reduce the credit risk relating to its outstanding financial derivative transactions. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and the transactions size and maturity. AIGs Derivatives Review Committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction or program except those derivative transactions entered into by AIGFP with third parties. The committee examines, among other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. FAS 133 requires that third party derivatives used for hedging must be specifically matched with the underlying exposures to an outside third party and documented contemporaneously to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. In most cases, AIG did not meet these hedging requirements with respect to certain hedging transactions. Not meeting the requirements of FAS 133 does not result in any changes in AIGs liquidity or its overall financial condition even though inter period volatility of earnings is increased. See also Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information relating to AIGs derivative activities, and Note 1(ee) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for AIGs derivative accounting policies. Managing Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies, equities and commodity prices. AIG has exposures to these risks. AIG analyzes market risk using various statistical techniques including Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that applies the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors to AIGs market positions. The output from the VaR calculation is the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models. AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management. Insurance AIG has performed a separate VaR analysis for the General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services segments and for each market risk within each segment. For purposes of the VaR calculation, the insurance assets and liabilities from GICs are included in the Life Insurance & Retirement Services AIG Form 10 K 65 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued segment. For the calculations in the analyses the financial instrument assets included are the insurance segments invested assets, excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued, and the financial instrument liabilities included are reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and other policyholders funds. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of each of AIGs insurance segments as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. The VaR number represents the maximum potential loss as of those dates that could be incurred with a 95 percent confidence (i.e., only five percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the VaR figure) within a one month holding period. AIG uses the historical simulation methodology that entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. AIG uses the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices. For each scenario, each transaction was repriced. Portfolio, business unit and finally AIG wide scenario values are then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities. The following table presents the VaR on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of AIGs insurance segments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Due to diversification effects, the combined VaR is always smaller than the sum of its components. Life Insurance & General Insurance Retirement Services (in millions) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Market risk: Combined $ 1,617 $ 1,396 $ 4,515 $ 5,024 Interest rate 1,717 1,563 4,382 4,750 Currency 130 139 541 478 Equity 535 727 762 1,024 The following table presents the average, high and low VaRs on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of AIGs insurance segments for the years 2005 and 2004. Due to diversification effects, the combined VaR is always smaller than the sum of its components. 2005 2004 (in millions) Average High Low Average High Low General Insurance: Market risk: Combined $ 1,585 $ 1,672 $ 1,396 $ 1,299 $ 1,497 $ 1,100 Interest rate 1,746 1,931 1,563 1,407 1,591 1,173 Currency 125 139 111 111 139 88 Equity 651 727 535 744 797 688 Life Insurance & Retirement Services: Market risk: Combined $ 4,737 $ 5,024 $ 4,515 $ 4,021 $ 5,024 $ 3,075 Interest rate 4,488 4,750 4,382 3,831 4,750 2,967 Currency 511 560 442 326 478 257 Equity 953 1,024 762 884 1,024 758 The Combined VaR and Interest Rate VaR for Life Insurance & Retirement Services trended higher during 2004 because of growth in the Asian life businesses. The December 2004 VaR results are equal to the maximum values observed during the year. During 2005, the Combined VaR and Interest Rate VaR for Life Insurance & Retirement Services remained in a narrower range. The December 2005 VaR results are somewhat lower than the December 2004 figures because long term interest rates in Asia declined during the year. In addition, the increase in Combined and Interest Rate VaRs from 2004 to 2005 in the General Insurance division was caused by growth in this business. Financial Services AIG generally manages its market exposures within Financial Services by maintaining offsetting positions. Capital Markets seeks to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered market positions. Credit exposure is managed separately. See the discussion on the management of credit risk above. AIGs Market Risk Management Department provides detailed independent review of AIGs market exposures, particularly those market exposures of the Capital Markets operations. This department determines whether AIGs market risks, as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries, are within the parameters established by AIGs senior management. Well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used. Additionally, this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary. ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, AIG statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a VaR model. In this analysis, the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the 66 AIG Form 10 K AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue, and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt. The estimated effect of the current derivative positions was also taken into account. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations using the historical simulation methodology, as previously described. For the years 2005 and 2004, the average VaR with respect to the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations was approximately $135 million and $70 million, respectively. Capital Markets operations are exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. AIGFP hedges its exposure to these risks primarily through swaps, options, forwards, and futures. To economically hedge interest rate risks, AIGFP may also purchase U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP does not seek to manage the market risk of each transaction through an individual third party offsetting transaction. Rather, AIGFP takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposures. AIGFP values the predominant portion of its market sensitive transactions by marking them to market currently through income. A smaller portion is priced by estimated fair value based upon an extrapolation of market factors. There is another limited portion of transactions where the initial fair value is not recorded through income currently and gains or losses are recognized over the life of the transactions. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by AIGFP and AIG management. The recorded values of these transactions may be different from the values that might be realized if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to financial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity. AIGFP attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription services such as from Bloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model. When such prices are not available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. Historically, actual results have not materially deviated from these models in any material respect. Systems used by Capital Markets operations can monitor each units respective market positions on an intraday basis. AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and therefore is open for business essentially 24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the clock. AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect significant potential market movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices, volatility levels, and the effect of time. These techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio. The results from these analyses are regularly reviewed by AIG management. As described above, Capital Markets operations are exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices as well as implied volatilities thereon. AIG statistically measures the losses of fair value through the application of a VaR model across Capital Markets. Capital Markets asset and liability portfolios for which the VaR analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments, derivative instruments and commodities. Because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale, at market, is substantially hedged, segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary. The VaR calculation is unaffected by the accounting treatment of hedged transactions under FAS 133. In the calculation of VaR for Capital Markets operations, AIG uses the same historical simulation methodology, described under Insurance above, which entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. In 2004, AIGFP enhanced its library of factors by including implied option volatilities to construct the historical scenarios for simulation. The following table presents the VaR on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for Capital Markets operations as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Due to diversification effects, the combined VaR is always smaller than the sum of its components.
